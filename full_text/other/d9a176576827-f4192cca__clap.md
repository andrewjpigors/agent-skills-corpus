# CLAP Skill

Use this skill when touching Pulp's CLAP adapter, when answering
questions about how a Pulp plugin appears to a CLAP host, or when a
CLAP validator run surfaces something odd. CLAP is Pulp's first-class,
MIT-safe plugin format — every plugin built with Pulp ships a CLAP
binary and CLAP is the fastest iteration lane because the
`clap-validator` runs without a DAW.

## When to use

- Editing `core/format/src/clap_adapter.cpp` or the generated entry header
  `core/format/include/pulp/format/clap_entry.hpp` (the boilerplate-
  generator macro `PULP_CLAP_PLUGIN(…)`).
- Adding or changing a CLAP extension (`audio-ports`, `note-ports`,
  `params`, `state`, `gui`, `preset-load`, ARA companion factory, …).
- A CLAP host reports a behaviour issue — sidechain missing, MIDI
  events dropped, presets not loading, GUI refusing to attach.
- A `clap-validator` pass regresses.
- Working on the MPE or UMP sidecar as it flows through the CLAP path
  — the CLAP adapter is currently the canonical consumer of
  `set_mpe_input` / `set_ump_input`.
- Cross-referencing CLAP behaviour against VST3 / AU when debugging
  host-specific regressions — use the three adapters as each other's
  "oracle" during parity fixes.

The `PULP_CLAP_PLUGIN(factory_fn)` macro (bottom of `clap_entry.hpp`) is the
single-plugin developer surface. It registers one plugin *record*, keeps the
legacy global factory slot (`register_plugin(factory_fn)`), and defines the
`clap_entry` exported symbol. There is no separate "factory" TU — the macro is
the factory.

### Multi-plugin bundle — one CLAP binary, many plugins

A CLAP module has exactly ONE `clap_entry` symbol but its factory may list many
plugins. `clap_entry.hpp` supports this via a per-plugin **record** array
(`g_clap_records`) instead of the old single `g_factory`/`g_desc`/`g_clap_desc`
globals:

```cpp
PULP_CLAP_BUNDLE_PLUGIN(Foo, create_foo)   // register a plugin (repeat, distinct Ident)
PULP_CLAP_BUNDLE_PLUGIN(Bar, create_bar)
PULP_CLAP_BUNDLE_ENTRY()                    // the ONE clap_entry symbol
```

Load-bearing facts, each a trap if forgotten:

- **Descriptors are built in `entry_init()`, NOT at static init.** Building a
  descriptor calls the factory → constructs a `Processor`, which is unsafe during
  C++ static initialization (global/`std::string` order). `register_clap_record`
  stores only the factory at static init; `init_all_records()` (invoked from the
  host's `clap_entry.init()`) fills each record's descriptor. A test that queries
  the factory MUST call `clap_entry.init(...)` first — the old
  `init_descriptor()` free function is gone.
- **`get_plugin_count()` returns the count of uniquely-addressable plugins**
  (the deduplicated index `init_all_records()` builds — a record whose
  `bundle_id` collides with an earlier one, or whose factory returned null, is
  excluded so the host is never handed an advertised-but-unreachable
  descriptor). **`create_plugin(id)` resolves BY ID** (via `find_clap_record`),
  not by a single hardcoded descriptor. Every plugin needs a unique `bundle_id`.
- **Extension callbacks read per-instance metadata, never a global.** Before
  `clap_init()` constructs `processor`, `audio_ports` / `note_ports` read
  `PulpClapPlugin::descriptor_snapshot` (cached from the record at
  `create_plugin()`); after, they prefer the live `processor->descriptor()`. When
  adding a new extension that needs bus/MIDI metadata, follow this pattern — do
  NOT reintroduce a file-scope descriptor global.
- Each record is also published to the shared keyed registry (`registry.hpp`,
  see the `auv2` skill) at init for cross-format enumeration / editor assets.
- Single-plugin `PULP_CLAP_PLUGIN` is unchanged behaviourally; a bundle is opt-in.

Tests: `test/test_clap_bundle_entry.cpp` (two plugins, one entry) and the
migrated `test/test_clap_entry.cpp` (single-plugin contract + per-instance
`descriptor_snapshot` fallback).

## Core conventions

### The shape of a CLAP instance

`PulpClapPlugin` (in `clap_adapter.hpp`) is the shared per-instance
struct. It owns:

- `std::unique_ptr<Processor> processor` — the user's DSP.
- `state::StateStore store` — parameter state, wired to the processor
  via `set_state_store(&store)` during `clap_init`.
- Pre-allocated `input_ptrs` / `output_ptrs` / `sidechain_ptrs` arrays
  sized to `kMaxChannels = 8`. **Process must not allocate** — these
  pointer fan-outs are static across calls.
- `param_snapshot` for detecting plugin-side parameter edits during
  `process()`. After `processor->process()`, the adapter compares each
  param to its snapshot and emits `CLAP_EVENT_PARAM_VALUE` out-events
  so the host can record automation.
  - **RT-safety invariant:** every scratch vector `process()` sizes to
    `all_params().size()` (via `resize`/`assign`) runs on the audio thread,
    so each MUST be `reserve()`d to that size in `clap_activate()` — otherwise
    the first block grows-and-allocates. `param_snapshot` **and**
    `output_param_has_event` (the sample-accurate-output skip-set) are both
    reserved there. Adding a new per-param scratch means adding its reserve;
    the `ClapSlot::process is allocation-free` rt-safety test catches a miss
    (it measures the first block, where the missing reserve shows up).
- `param_events` (`state::ParameterEventQueue`) for the current block's
  inbound `CLAP_EVENT_PARAM_VALUE` events. It preserves every host
  automation point with `header.time` before the StateStore dual-write
  lands the last value for ordinary parameter reads.
- `mpe_tracker` + `mpe_buffer` + `mpe_enabled` — MPE sidecar populated
  only if `PluginDescriptor::effective_capabilities().supports_mpe`
  is true. The effective value ORs the legacy descriptor flag with the
  node ABI capability field. `clap_activate()` reserves and capacity-limits
  the sidecar too; one MIDI event can fan out to many MPE callbacks.
- `ump_buffer` + `ump_enabled` — UMP sidecar. Cleared at the top of
  every block, then filled from BOTH sources every block: native
  `CLAP_EVENT_MIDI2` packets append directly during the event loop,
  and after decode `midi1_to_ump(midi_in, ump_buffer)` always runs
  (synthesises UMP from the MIDI 1.0 stream). Both paths run
  unconditionally because real hosts mix transports — notes via
  `CLAP_EVENT_NOTE_*` and CCs via `CLAP_EVENT_MIDI2` is common, and
  skipping the synthesis when MIDI2 is present silently drops the
  note half from the UMP buffer. See Gotchas. `clap_activate()` reserves
  and capacity-limits this sidecar.
- `native_f64_enabled` plus the `data64` scratch/pointer arrays — CLAP hosts
  may provide double-precision audio buffers. If
  `PluginDescriptor::effective_capabilities().supports_f64_audio` is false,
  the adapter converts host `data64` to the normal f32 `process(...)` path and
  converts f32 outputs back to `data64`. If the plugin opts in, every active
  routed bus for the block must be f64 before the adapter calls
  `Processor::process_f64(ProcessBuffers64&, ...)`; mixed f32/f64 blocks stay
  on the compatibility path. Every audio port advertises
  `CLAP_AUDIO_PORT_SUPPORTS_64BITS` (in `audio_ports_get`), and native-f64
  descriptors additionally advertise `CLAP_AUDIO_PORT_PREFERS_64BITS` — a
  spec-compliant host only sends `data64` to ports carrying the SUPPORTS
  flag, so dropping it silently kills the whole f64 path. The boundary
  f64→f32 demotion and output-scratch pre-zero are deferred until after the
  native-f64 decision inside `clap_process` (native blocks read the host's
  double buffers directly and skip the conversion); keep any new bus wiring
  consistent with that ordering.
- `ara_controller` — lazily created on the first host query for the
  ARA companion-factory extension.
- `bridge` + `editor_host` + `editor_visible` — gated on
  `PULP_CLAP_GUI`. Editor lifecycle flows through `ViewBridge`; see the
  `view-bridge` skill for the open/attach/close protocol.

`PulpClapPlugin` is consumed from two translation units: the per-plugin
`clap_entry.cpp` and the shared `clap_adapter.cpp` in `pulp-format`.
They must see the same GUI define. Desktop plugin builds compile both
with `PULP_CLAP_GUI=1`; WCLAP/non-GUI builds compile both with
`PULP_CLAP_GUI=0`. Do not add GUI-only fields under a preprocessor
condition unless the shared adapter target receives the same condition.
A layout mismatch presents as random CLAP lifecycle corruption, often a
REAPER crash in `gui_create()` or `clap_activate()` touching a bogus
`bridge`/`editor_host` pointer.

### Parameters

Parameter semantics come from `ParamInfo::kind`, not heuristics over step/range.
`value_labels` are the single display and parse table; toggle/enum host text does
not accept arbitrary numeric fallback. Route conversion through
`parameter_text.hpp`, which also contains author exceptions.

Parameters are defined by the Processor during `define_parameters(store)`
and enumerated to the host by the `params` extension in
`clap_entry.hpp`:

- `params_count` → `store.param_count()`.
- `params_get_info` → builds a `clap_param_info_t` from the stored
  `ParamInfo`. `CLAP_PARAM_IS_AUTOMATABLE` is always set.
  `CLAP_PARAM_IS_STEPPED` is set when `range.step >= 1` and the range
  is narrow (`< 10`).
- `params_get_value` returns the current **base** value (without
  modulation).
- `params_value_to_text` uses `ParamInfo::to_string` when provided,
  otherwise falls back to `"%.2f %s"` with the unit.

During `clap_process`, the adapter routes host events into the store:

```
CLAP_EVENT_PARAM_VALUE   → store.set_value_rt(id, value)   ← RT-safe
CLAP_EVENT_PARAM_MOD     → store.set_mod_offset(id, amount)
CLAP_EVENT_PARAM_GESTURE_BEGIN / _END → store.begin_gesture / end_gesture
```

**Use `set_value_rt`, not `set_value`, on the audio thread.** The generic
`set_value()` path dispatches `ListenerThread::Main` listeners through
the installed `EventLoop`, and that dispatch lambda allocates on the
firing thread — fatal for the audio thread. `set_value_rt()` writes the
atomic + pushes an event on a non-allocating SPSC queue; the editor's
UI tick drains via `store.pump_listeners()`. Audio listeners still fire
inline (caller asserts RT-safety), so audio-thread listeners must be
trivial, non-allocating, and bounded.

Do not collapse inbound CLAP parameter automation to a single last point.
`clap_process` appends every `CLAP_EVENT_PARAM_VALUE` to
`PulpClapPlugin::param_events`, sorts by sample offset, and still calls
`store.set_value_rt(...)` for the same events so legacy block-level reads
observe the final value.
Before calling `Processor::process()`, the adapter attaches that queue via
`processor->set_param_events(&param_events)`, so sample-accurate processors
read the same sorted events through `Processor::param_events()`.

The **modulation offset is per-buffer**: `store.reset_all_mod()` runs
at the top of every `process()` before applying new `PARAM_MOD` events.
DSP reads modulated values via `store.get_modulated(id)` = base +
current mod offset. Plugins that only read `store.get_value(id)` do
**not** see host modulation.

### Audio buses (incl. sidechain)

When `supported_bus_layouts` is non-empty, expose
`CLAP_EXT_AUDIO_PORTS_CONFIG`. `audio_ports_get` and `clap_activate` must both
use the selected widths so `PrepareContext` matches host metadata.

`audio_ports` enumeration in `clap_entry.hpp` is descriptor-driven:
`desc.input_buses` / `desc.output_buses`. **Bus 0 is always the main
bus** (flag `CLAP_AUDIO_PORT_IS_MAIN`); **bus 1 (when present) is the
sidechain** and is routed via `Processor::set_sidechain(&view)` before
`process()`. Additional input buses beyond index 1 are ignored — the
Processor API exposes a single sidechain slot.

**Secondary (aux) output buses ARE routed** to the richer
`Processor::process(ProcessBuffers&)` surface (role `Aux`, index ≥1) for
multi-out instruments (drum machines, multitimbral, stem renderers).
`clap_process` builds one `ProcessBusBufferView<float>` per host output
bus from pre-allocated `aux_output_ptrs[kMaxOutputBuses-1][kMaxChannels]`
storage (row `b-1` backs host bus `b`; the main bus uses `output_ptrs`),
so the routing path never allocates on the audio thread. Each aux bus is
**pre-zeroed before `process()`**, so a single-output processor (whose
default `process(ProcessBuffers&)` writes only the main bus) leaves aux
buses silent — no uninitialised memory, no behavioural change. A
multi-out processor overrides `process(ProcessBuffers&)` and writes each
aux bus. The aux view's `declared_channels` is the descriptor's declared
count (cached in `clap_activate` — never call `descriptor()` on the audio
thread; it allocates), while `buffer.num_channels()` carries the actual
routed count, so `matches_declared_layout()` can detect a host-vs-declared
mismatch. Host output buses beyond `kMaxOutputBuses` are zero-filled but
not routed.

### MIDI: short messages, sysex, note-expression, UMP

Inbound event decode in `clap_process()`:

```
CLAP_EVENT_NOTE_ON / _NOTE_OFF → MidiEvent::note_on / note_off
CLAP_EVENT_MIDI                → MidiEvent::from_bytes(data[0..2])
                                 — CC, pitch bend, channel AT,
                                   poly AT, program change
CLAP_EVENT_MIDI_SYSEX          → midi_in.add_sysex_copy(bytes, time, 0.0)
                                 backed by a preallocated payload pool
CLAP_EVENT_NOTE_EXPRESSION     → synthesised MIDI 1.0 (see table)
CLAP_EVENT_NOTE_CHOKE          → note_off(channel, key, velocity=0)
CLAP_EVENT_MIDI2               → self->ump_buffer.add(packet)
                                 (guarded by CLAP_VERSION_GE(1,1,0) —
                                  the event is an enumerator, NOT a
                                  preprocessor macro; see Gotchas)
```

**Note-expression → MIDI 1.0 mapping.** `MpeVoiceTracker` only ingests
MIDI 1.0, so per-note expressions are synthesised to channel-wide
equivalents and narrowed back per-voice by the tracker:

| CLAP expression id | Synthesised MIDI 1.0 |
|---|---|
| `PRESSURE` | channel aftertouch `0xDn` |
| `TUNING` | 14-bit pitch bend (normalised to ±48st member range) |
| `BRIGHTNESS` | CC 74 |
| `VOLUME` | CC 7 (0..4 → 0..127 log-domain scale) |
| `PAN` | CC 10 |
| `VIBRATO`, `EXPRESSION` | dropped — no unambiguous MIDI 1.0 equivalent; UMP-aware plug-ins should consume via the `CLAP_EVENT_MIDI2` path |

Non-MPE descriptors drop note-expression events with a one-time
debug log. See the `mpe` skill for tracker details.

**Outbound MIDI**: the processor's `midi_out` emits short messages as
`CLAP_EVENT_MIDI` and sysex entries as
`CLAP_EVENT_MIDI_SYSEX`, both via `out_events->try_push`.
`sample_offset` carries through to `header.time` via the shared cross-format
helper `detail::clap_output_offset(sample_offset)` (clamps a negative offset up
to 0, since `header.time` is unsigned) — the same "offset N in → offset N out"
contract AU v2 and VST3 share, defined once in
`core/format/include/pulp/format/detail/midi_out_offset.hpp` and pinned by
`test/test_midi_out_offset_parity.cpp`. Do NOT re-open-code the offset clamp.
The sysex
`clap_event_midi_sysex_t.buffer` field is non-owning — the backing
vector is alive for the duration of `clap_process()`, which is all
CLAP's push contract requires (the host copies before returning).

`midi_in`, `midi_out`, `mpe_buffer`, and `ump_buffer` are per-instance
buffers on `PulpClapPlugin`, not fresh locals inside `clap_process()`.
`clap_activate()` reserves their storage and enables realtime capacity
limits, then `clap_process()` clears and reuses them every block. Past
the reserved capacity, appends must drop and increment the relevant drop
counters; they must not grow vectors under the process no-allocation
guard.

Inbound CLAP SysEx is the exception to the move-based adapter pattern:
the host gives the adapter a non-owning payload pointer, so accepting it
requires copying bytes into owned storage. `clap_activate()` reserves a
bounded payload pool on `midi_in`; `MidiBuffer::add_sysex_copy()` copies
into that pool on the realtime-limited process path and drops only when
the sidecar count or per-payload capacity is exceeded. Keep the happy
path and overflow case covered in `test_clap_midi_events.cpp`.

If you add a new inbound/outbound MIDI path, cover the overflow case in
`test_clap_midi_events.cpp`. If you add a test processor that
captures/forwards sysex while behind the CLAP no-alloc guard, preallocate
destination SysEx payload storage in `prepare()` and call
`MidiBuffer::add_sysex_copy()` for explicit captures. Whole-event
forwarding with `midi_out.add_sysex(std::move(sx))` is supported because
pool-backed input events copy into the destination's prepared payload
pool; moving only `sx.data` out of `midi_in` is intentionally not
supported. Copying a vector payload inside `process()` will trip the RT
allocation trap under ASan/TSan/debug test builds.

### State save / restore

Serialisation goes through the single `StateStore::serialize()` /
`deserialize(bytes)` path (in `clap_entry.hpp` `state_ext`). Format is
the Pulp binary blob — identical bytes across CLAP / VST3 / AU, so
round-trip parity is trivial to test.

### Transport context

`clap_process()` maps `process->transport` into `ProcessContext` when
the host supplies it:

- `is_playing` / `is_recording` from the CLAP transport flags.
- `tempo_bpm` only when `CLAP_TRANSPORT_HAS_TEMPO` is set.
- `position_beats` from `song_pos_beats / CLAP_BEATTIME_FACTOR` when
  `CLAP_TRANSPORT_HAS_BEATS_TIMELINE` is set.
- `position_samples` from `song_pos_seconds / CLAP_SECTIME_FACTOR *
  sample_rate` when `CLAP_TRANSPORT_HAS_SECONDS_TIMELINE` is set.
  Leave it at 0 when the host omits the seconds timeline; deriving an
  absolute sample position from beats + current tempo is not authoritative
  in tempo-mapped projects and can create false transport jumps.
- time signature, loop range, and bar from the matching CLAP fields.

Keep `position_samples` non-zero when the host provides a seconds timeline;
native-core processors forward it as `playhead_frames`, so leaving it at the
default 0 makes CLAP-only playhead-sensitive processors think every block
starts at the song origin.

### Editor

Gated on `PULP_CLAP_GUI`; for desktop CLAP, both the shared
`pulp-format` adapter TU and the per-plugin entry TU must compile with
the same value. Lifecycle flows through
`pulp::format::ViewBridge`: `gui_create` → `bridge->open()`, the host
then calls `gui_set_parent(window)` → `editor_host->attach_to_parent` +
`bridge->notify_attached()`, `gui_destroy` → `bridge->close()`. See the
`view-bridge` skill for the full contract — the CLAP adapter is the
reference implementation for the "open, then notify_attached after
host has attached" protocol.

Window API negotiation is compile-time platform-switched to Cocoa /
Win32 / X11.

### Proportional resize with aspect lock

`gui_can_resize` returns `true`. `gui_get_resize_hints` advertises
`preserve_aspect_ratio=true` with `aspect_ratio_{width,height}` set to
the editor's preferred design size, so DAWs (Bitwig, Reaper, Live, …)
lock the corner-drag to the design aspect. `gui_adjust_size` snaps the
requested rectangle to the design aspect (largest box at the design
aspect that fits within the request), then clamps to plugin min/max
constraints.

`gui_create` calls `host->set_design_viewport(design_w, design_h)` so
the host scales content to fit the resized window via a paint-time
canvas transform — the JS/Yoga tree still thinks it's at design size,
and the existing `gui_set_size` → `host->set_size(...)` path resizes
the surfaces without re-laying out. This is the proportional+locked
behavior the standalone host already had (same design-viewport contract as WindowHost); AU v2
cannot offer it because the DAW resizes the returned NSView directly
with no host-side `gui_can_resize` analogue. Cross-format design lives
in the `view-bridge` skill.

`gui_create` calls
`pulp::format::decide_gpu_host(*bridge)` so a Skia/Dawn/scripted editor
auto-selects the GPU `PluginViewHost`, wires the per-vsync scripted idle pump
(`make_scripted_idle_pump`), and screams via `warn_if_unexpected_cpu_fallback`
on a silent CPU fallback. CLAP's `gui_set_size` already resizes the bridge +
host, so no extra resize seam is needed (unlike AU v2). Full contract: the
`view-bridge` skill's "GPU view host auto-selection" section.

### ARA companion factory

`clap_get_extension(kClapAraFactoryExtension)` lazily creates the
plugin's `AraDocumentController` on first query, then returns the
companion factory pointer. Only instantiates when the Processor
overrode `create_ara_document_controller()` — plugins that don't
participate in ARA return `nullptr` naturally. See the `ara` skill.

### Bypass routing — auto-detected

CLAP doesn't model "bypass" as a first-class extension the way VST3
(`kIsBypass`) or AU v3 (`AUAudioUnitBypass`) do — hosts treat a
plugin-declared `"Bypass"` parameter as the on/off lane. The adapter
auto-detects that parameter at `clap_init` and short-circuits
`clap_process` to pass-through (in→out for effects, zero-fill for
instruments) when the cached parameter's current value is `>= 0.5`,
without invoking `Processor::process`. MIDI output stays empty so
bypassed MIDI FX don't leak notes — same contract the VST3 and AU v3
adapters honour.

**Param designation (declared bypass) + trigger params.** The bypass
parameter is found through the shared `pulp::state::is_bypass_param`
contract, not a re-implemented name/range check. A Processor author can
declare `ParamInfo::designation = ParamDesignation::Bypass` to mark a
param as the bypass control *independently of its name* — the legacy
boolean-`"Bypass"` name/range heuristic remains the fallback when no
designation is declared, so existing plugins are unchanged. The adapter
also calls `StateStore::reset_triggers_rt()` to auto-reset trigger /
momentary params (`is_trigger`, or a `ParamDesignation::Reset`
"reset/panic" control) back to their default. The call sits AFTER the
bypass if/else (not inside the non-bypass branch), so it is a
**single-exit invariant**: a trigger raised while bypassed still settles
this block instead of firing late. It runs before the `out_events` scan,
so the host records the settle. Input param events are applied to the
store before the bypass check, so a host-raised trigger is observed-then-
settled within the same block whether or not the plugin is bypassed.

### Latency / tail change notifications

A Processor flags a mid-render latency or tail change via
`flag_latency_changed()` / `flag_tail_changed()` (RT-safe atomic
store-release). Don't call `clap_host_latency->changed()` from
`process()` directly — the spec requires that on the main thread.

CLAP wiring (the most involved of the four adapters):

1. `create_plugin()` captures the `clap_host_t*` pointer for later
   `request_callback()` use.
2. `process()` peeks via `latency_change_pending()` /
   `tail_change_pending()` (non-mutating — does NOT drain the edge)
   and, if either is set, calls `host->request_callback()` to ask
   the host for a main-thread callback.
3. `clap_on_main_thread()` then drains via
   `consume_latency_changed_flag()` / `consume_tail_changed_flag()`
   and calls `clap_host_latency->changed()` /
   `clap_host_tail->changed()`.

The peek-vs-consume split exists specifically for CLAP — VST3 / AU
v3 / AU v2 drain in-line because their host APIs are safe from the
audio callback path. Don't collapse the two helpers into one if you
add another adapter that needs the same edge.

### Preset loading

`clap_plugin_preset_load` is exposed only when the Processor builds a
`PresetManager` during `clap_init` (driven by
`desc.manufacturer`/`desc.name`). Today only
`CLAP_PRESET_DISCOVERY_LOCATION_FILE` is honoured; bundle- and plugin-
internal preset sources are ignored and return false.

### Remote controls and dynamic extension routing

`clap_entry.hpp::get_extension(plugin, id)` handles static extensions first,
then delegates to `clap_adapter::clap_get_extension(plugin, id)` for
instance-owned extensions such as `preset-load`, ARA, and
`clap.remote-controls/2`. Any new adapter-owned extension must be reachable
through the real host callback path, not only through direct unit-test calls
to the adapter helper.

Remote-control page generation lives in `clap_remote_controls.cpp`. It is a
main-thread, metadata-only extension: build pages from `StateStore` parameter
and group metadata, do not touch DSP state, and do not add audio-thread work
to `clap_process()`. The current pages expose ungrouped params as `Main`,
then grouped params in registered group order, eight params per page, with
unused slots set to `CLAP_INVALID_ID`. Keep the stable
`CLAP_EXT_REMOTE_CONTROLS` id and the compatibility id routed together unless
the CLAP headers remove the older spelling.

## Gotchas

### Sidechain `data32` can be null — guard before routing

A host may report `audio_inputs_count > 1` but hand the adapter a null
`data32` pointer (bus deactivated). A loose translation of "bus exists
→ publish sidechain" hands the Processor a `BufferView` over garbage.
The guard in `clap_process` demotes the whole sidechain bus to "not
supplied" if any per-channel pointer is null — do not remove it.

```cpp
if (sc_bus.data32) {
    sc_channels = std::min(static_cast<int>(sc_bus.channel_count), kMaxChannels);
    for (int ch = 0; ch < sc_channels; ++ch) {
        self->sidechain_ptrs[ch] = sc_bus.data32[ch];
        if (!self->sidechain_ptrs[ch]) { sc_channels = 0; break; }
    }
}
```

The VST3 adapter carries the same guard for null bus channel pointers.
Mirror both whenever reshaping the sidechain path.

### Aux output bus `data32` can be null too — guard the pre-zero loop

A deactivated **secondary output** bus can report `channel_count > 0`
while `data32 == nullptr`, exactly like the sidechain case. The aux
pre-zero loop in `clap_process` runs *before* the routing loop's own
`data32` guard, so it must `if (!bus.data32) continue;` before indexing
`bus.data32[ch]` — otherwise a host that presents an inactive aux output
null-derefs on the audio thread. Both the pre-zero loop and the routing
loop guard the bus pointer; keep both.

### Reset modulation offsets **every** buffer

`store.reset_all_mod()` is the first line of `clap_process()`. If you
refactor the process prologue, keep it first — otherwise stale
`PARAM_MOD` offsets from a previous block leak into the next one and
the plugin's DSP drifts away from the host's expected modulated value.
Found during CLAP modulation bring-up.

### `param_snapshot` is **per-buffer**, not cached

The snapshot is taken after host events are applied but before
`processor->process()`. The diff compared against current values at
the end is what the adapter emits as `PARAM_VALUE` out-events. If you
optimise this into a persisted snapshot you will drop plugin-side
param edits that happen at block boundaries.

### Secondary output buses must be zero-filled

Multi-out instruments that don't route to bus ≥ 1 leave those output
buffers whatever the host's last tenant wrote. The adapter zeroes
every secondary output channel every block — do not skip this even for
"only bus 0 used" plugins; some hosts reuse memory across plugin
slots.

### `constant_mask` on an output bus is inherited, not given to you clean

`clap_audio_buffer_t::constant_mask` is the *plugin's* promise about the
block it just wrote: bit N set means "every frame of channel N equals
sample 0", and a host may act on it by reading one sample instead of the
block. The host never clears it, and CLAP explicitly permits in-place
buffers — so an output bus can arrive still carrying the mask an upstream
plugin set on the input it aliases. An adapter that never writes the mask
inherits that lie, and a plugin whose output varies gets read back as one
held sample.

`clap_process` therefore clears `constant_mask` on **every** output bus
(not just the routed ones) after the Processor call and after the bypass
short-circuit. Zero means "no channel is known constant", which is always
true and always safe. Never set a bit speculatively: a set bit obliges you
to have actually filled the channel with that constant.

The symptom is loudest on CV-rate outputs — where the variation *is* the
signal, so the whole plug-in reads as a frozen DC level — and can be
invisible on audio, because hosts are free to ignore the mask entirely.
Never touch the *input* bus's mask; that one belongs to the host.

### ARA companion factory is returned **only after Processor exists**

`clap_get_extension` may be called before `clap_init` populates
`self->processor`. The current impl returns the static companion
factory pointer early; it only lazily instantiates the
`AraDocumentController` once `self->processor != nullptr`. If you
refactor this path, preserve that ordering — eagerly constructing the
controller at extension-query time triggers the
`create_ara_document_controller()` virtual before the Processor is
alive.

### UMP sidecar: native + synthesised, both always run

The adapter handles every host shape: pure MIDI 1.0 (`CLAP_EVENT_NOTE_*`
+ `CLAP_EVENT_MIDI`), pure MIDI 2.0 (`CLAP_EVENT_MIDI2`), and mixed
(notes via NOTE_*, CCs via MIDI2 — common in real DAWs).

1. At the top of every `clap_process()` block, `ump_buffer.clear()`
   runs when `ump_enabled`. This is load-bearing — keep the clear
   up-front so the buffer reflects only the current block.
2. During event decode, `CLAP_EVENT_MIDI2` packets are appended
   directly to `self->ump_buffer`. `host_delivered_ump` is retained as
   observability only; it must not gate MIDI 1.0 synthesis.
3. After the decode loop, `midi1_to_ump(midi_in, self->ump_buffer)`
   ALWAYS runs when `ump_enabled`. Skipping synthesis when the host
   delivered any MIDI2 silently drops the note half of mixed streams from
   the UMP buffer. CLAP guarantees a spec-conformant host won't redundantly
   encode the same logical event in two transports, so unconditional
   synthesis doesn't double-deliver.

The UMP buffer shape lives in `core/midi/include/pulp/midi/ump_buffer.hpp`
and the CLAP adapter's `ump_buffer` sidecar.

### CLAP event types are enumerators, not preprocessor macros

When gating on a new CLAP event type, **do not** write
`#ifdef CLAP_EVENT_MIDI2` — `CLAP_EVENT_MIDI2` is a C enumerator value,
and `#ifdef` on an enum always evaluates false. Use
`#if defined(CLAP_VERSION_GE) && CLAP_VERSION_GE(1, 1, 0)` (or the
release that introduced the event) instead. Same trap applies to any
future `CLAP_EVENT_*` additions — the CLAP header does not define
them as macros. Use the guard shape in `core/format/src/clap_adapter.cpp`.

### Param text parsing must be locale-independent — but not via `std::from_chars<float>`

`params_text_to_value` and `params_value_to_text` must be immune to a
comma-decimal global host locale (a DAW that called `setlocale`): a typed-in
`"0.5"` must never parse as `0.0`, and a formatted value must never emit
`"0,5"`. Use `std::to_chars` for formatting (always C-locale). For *parsing*,
the obvious choice — `std::from_chars` — is a **trap for floats**: libc++
leaves the floating-point `from_chars` overloads `=delete`d on some toolchains
(notably the github-hosted `macos-15` sanitizer image), so
`std::from_chars(first, last, a_double)` hard-fails the **Sanitizer Tests**
build with "call to deleted function 'from_chars'" while the Mac Studio
`macos` gate (which *has* the overload) stays green — the break hides on the
advisory lane. Integer `from_chars` is fine everywhere. For the float value,
parse through `pulp::format::detail::parse_double_c_locale`
(`core/format/include/pulp/format/detail/locale_independent_float.hpp`), a
C-locale `strtod` wrapper shared with the `.pulpset` parser.

### GUI layout must match across CLAP TUs

Do not use `#ifdef PULP_CLAP_GUI` for CLAP GUI fields or extension
dispatch; use `#if defined(PULP_CLAP_GUI) && PULP_CLAP_GUI`. The WCLAP
path may define `PULP_CLAP_GUI=0`, and `#ifdef` treats that as enabled.
The desktop shared adapter and the per-plugin entry must agree on
whether GUI fields exist in `PulpClapPlugin`, or later lifecycle fields
shift and hosts crash when opening or activating the editor.

### ARA CLAP lives outside `CLAP_EXT_*`

The ARA companion factory is keyed on
`kClapAraFactoryExtension` (Pulp-private identifier), not one of CLAP's
reserved `CLAP_EXT_*` strings. Don't rename it; other Pulp + ARA hosts
already search for that exact key. Defined in `pulp/format/ara.hpp`.

### `clap-validator` is optional — fallback is dlopen

`pulp validate` (`tools/cli/cmd_validate.cpp`) runs
`clap-validator validate …` when installed, otherwise falls back to a
plain `dlopen` check. CI lanes without `clap-validator` still exercise
the "plugin loads" path; full spec conformance requires the validator
binary.

### AAX-parity sweep

AAX and CLAP share the same sysex-sidecar pattern. When you change the
CLAP sysex accumulator, the AAX adapter
(`core/format/src/aax_runtime.cpp`) and the VST3 / AU halves need to
stay in sync — see the memory note on AAX-parity.

### Filter in-events by `space_id` in every dispatch loop

Every `clap_input_events` dispatch loop in the adapter MUST check
`hdr->space_id == CLAP_CORE_EVENT_SPACE_ID` at the top and `continue`
on mismatch. Non-zero namespaces belong to third-party extensions
Pulp doesn't implement, and their type IDs may alias core type IDs
(e.g. a fictional extension's event type `5` could be mistaken for
`CLAP_EVENT_PARAM_VALUE` and mutate the param store). clap-validator
`param-set-wrong-namespace` exercises this with `space_id = 0xb33f`.

Covered sites today:

- `clap_adapter.cpp` process() param/gesture loop
- `clap_adapter.cpp` process() note/MIDI loop
- `clap_entry.hpp` `params_flush()` path

If you add a third in-events dispatch (e.g. a transport-event loop,
or a new extension's callback), add the same guard. Test pattern:
`test_clap_entry.cpp` → "CLAP params_flush ignores events outside
the core namespace [issue-743]" (the bracketed token is the Catch2 test tag).

### `clap_ostream::write` may short-write — loop state_save

`state_save` (in `clap_entry.hpp`) MUST loop on `stream->write()`
until the full payload is delivered. Per CLAP spec, a single `write`
call may return fewer bytes than requested even on success; only
negative or zero returns are errors. clap-validator's
`state-reproducibility-flush` exercises this by capping every write
at 23 bytes.

Symmetric note: `state_load`'s `stream->read` loop was already
correct; the bug was only on the write side.

### `on_non_realtime_tick()` fires in **native** CLAP, not just WebCLAP

`Processor::on_non_realtime_tick()` / `non_realtime_tick_pending()` exist so a
processor with **no worker thread of its own** can get expensive control-driven
work (decode, resample, FFT-plan, allocate) off the audio thread. The motivating
host is the browser — a WAM lives entirely inside an AudioWorklet and a WebCLAP
module has no `std::thread` — but the CLAP adapter calls the hook
**unconditionally**, so a *native* CLAP plugin gets it too:

- `clap_on_main_thread()` calls `on_non_realtime_tick()` every time.
- `state_load()` calls it after `deserialize()` — a restored state can name a
  different derived source than the live one, and a worker-less processor has no
  thread to notice; without this the audio thread renders the OLD derived state
  for the rest of the session.
- `clap_process()` **peeks** `non_realtime_tick_pending()` each block and calls
  `host->request_callback()` when set — the same mechanism already used for
  latency/tail changes. This is the only way out of the audio thread in CLAP,
  because CLAP delivers parameter changes as events *inside* `process()`.

Two things follow that are easy to get wrong:

1. **Do not write `on_non_realtime_tick()` assuming "this only runs in a
   browser."** It runs in Bitwig and Reaper. A processor that already has a real
   worker thread should do **nothing** here, or the worker and the host race.
2. **`non_realtime_tick_pending()` must be realtime-safe** — it is called from
   `process()` every block. Read atomics and compare. No locks, no allocation.

VST3, AU, and the standalone host do **not** call the hook at all. A processor
that depends on it for correctness must *also* have a worker (or do the work in
`prepare()`), or it will never reconcile in those formats. Both methods are
appended at the **end** of the `Processor` vtable to keep vtable ordering
additive-only (`node_abi_gate`) — keep it that way when adding more.

## Validation recipes

Build and smoke a CLAP bundle with the Pulp CLI:

```bash
# Build everything, then validate
./build/pulp build
./build/pulp validate          # runs clap-validator if installed
```

Direct `clap-validator` usage (matches what `cmd_validate.cpp` invokes):

```bash
# macOS / Linux
clap-validator validate "$(pwd)/build/path/to/MyPlugin.clap"

# Install if missing
cargo install clap-validator
```

CI's fallback when `clap-validator` is not on the path is a dlopen
check — load the bundle's entry symbol (`clap_entry`) and verify the
factory hands back a valid descriptor. See
`test/test_clap_entry.cpp` for the in-repo equivalent.

`pulp build --test` runs validation before allowing
`pulp build --install` to write into
`~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/CLAP/`. Do not `--skip-validation` a CLAP
build before a DAW scan — a crashing entry point takes the DAW down
with it.

### Validator runs must disable editor creation

`clap-validator` can query `CLAP_EXT_GUI` and call GUI callbacks even
when the test's intent is non-visual validation. Run validator automation
with `PULP_DISABLE_PLUGIN_EDITOR=1 PULP_HEADLESS=1 PULP_TEST_MODE=1`.
Under those guards, Pulp hides `CLAP_EXT_GUI` from `get_extension()` and
the GUI callbacks fail closed if a host cached the extension pointer.

## Host-API contract pinned by `test/test_clap_host_validation.cpp`

Real-DAW validation (Bitwig, Reaper, FL Studio, Studio One) requires
a license + manual install, so the CI proxy is
`test/test_clap_host_validation.cpp`. It pins the four contracts hosts
have historically broken on:

1. Plugin id + parameter id + range stability across instances.
2. `CLAP_EVENT_PARAM_MOD` does NOT bleed across blocks — the adapter
   calls `store.reset_all_mod()` at the top of every `process()`.
3. Non-core event spaces (`hdr->space_id != CLAP_CORE_EVENT_SPACE_ID`)
   are ignored, matching `clap-validator`'s
   `param-set-wrong-namespace` expectation.
4. `state.save` → `state.load` → `state.save` produces byte-equivalent
   output (Studio One project-recall determinism).

When changing the adapter's event dispatch or param surface, run
`pulp-test-clap-host-validation` first — it will catch the regression
before a host scan does.

### CLAP editor hands GpuSurface to ScriptedUiSession

`clap_entry.hpp::gui_create` calls
`p->bridge->scripted_ui()->attach_gpu_surface(p->editor_host->gpu_surface())`
right after `PluginViewHost::create()` succeeds. Without this, a
CLAP plugin whose UI uses Three.js or raw WebGPU JS renders black —
the JS shim silently falls back to mocks. See the `view-bridge` skill's
"GpuSurface plumbing into WidgetBridge" section.

## Host-quirks consumption

This adapter consumes the host-quirks ledger at init: it caches
`resolved_quirks(detect_host_info().type, version)` once (the runtime
policy — `PULP_HOST_QUIRKS` env / `set_host_quirk_policy()` API / compile
default — applies via `resolved_quirks()`), then gates DAW accommodations
on those flags instead of hardcoding them.

First wired flag: `clamp_latency_to_nonneg`. Latency reporting routes
through the pure helper `pulp::format::reported_latency_samples(raw, quirks)`
(in `host_quirks.hpp`): a negative `latency_samples()` clamps to 0 when the
quirk is enforced, and passes through raw (wrapping the unsigned host field)
when `PULP_HOST_QUIRKS=off`. See `docs/reference/host-quirks-policy.md`.

## synthesize_bypass_parameter pass-through

At init (clap_init / PulpAUEffect ctor), the adapter calls
`pulp::format::maybe_synthesize_bypass(store, host_quirks)` then detects the
"Bypass" param (shared boolean-range heuristic: name=="Bypass", step>=1,
0..1) into a cached `bypass_param_id`. In the audio callback (clap_process /
ProcessBufferLists) it short-circuits to a **null-guarded pass-through**
(copy main input → output, zero any output channel without a matching input)
and skips the Processor when the param value is >= 0.5 — mirroring the VST3
processBlockBypassed path. `PULP_HOST_QUIRKS=off` synthesizes nothing
(bypass_param_id stays 0). The pass-through MUST null-check each destination
channel pointer because a bus can report channels with null buffers.

## Sample-accurate parameter output

CLAP's `out_events` requires **globally ascending time across ALL event types**.
The param-output drain (`clap_adapter.cpp`) therefore does a **three-cursor
merge** of output param events + MIDI shorts + sysex by ascending sample offset,
not "params then MIDI". Snapshot-diff fallback params (all at offset 0) emit
first; a per-param skip-set stops them double-reporting a param that pushed
explicit `push_output_param_event()` events. CLAP param values are **plain
domain** (`double`), unlike VST3 which normalizes. `test_clap_midi_events.cpp`
asserts the `param@0, midi@8, param@16` interleave stays non-decreasing in time.

## `clap_process()` is phase-split — the phase ORDER is the contract

`clap_process()` is a sequence of named phase helpers rather than one
megafunction. The split is presentational: the phases must run in exactly the
order they do, because the CLAP boundary is order-sensitive in ways the function
names do not advertise — input events must be drained before the block is
processed, and the `out_events` drain must stay last so the three-cursor merge
above sees every event the block produced. Reordering two phases compiles
cleanly and passes any test that only checks a single-block render.

So when adding work, add it *inside* the phase that owns it; do not add a new
phase between existing ones without re-reading the merge contract above. The
guard is `test/test_adapter_audio_parity.cpp`, which renders through the real
adapter and nulls it against the direct render — a phase-order regression shows
up there as a block-boundary difference, not as a crash.

`find_param_index()` in `adapter_boundary.hpp` is shared by the CLAP and VST3
output-param publication paths so the two cannot drift. Note it is a **linear
scan**, not an index — param counts are small and the scan is what both adapters
already did. If it ever becomes hot, index it for both adapters at once; a
one-sided optimization is how these two paths drifted before.

## The StateStore must outlive the Processor

`Processor::state()` dereferences a pointer the host installs. A Processor may
follow it for its whole lifetime — from `process()`, from its destructor, and from
any worker thread that destructor is about to `join()`. So the host has to keep the
store alive until the Processor is gone.

In practice that is one rule about member order: **declare the `state::StateStore`
before the `std::unique_ptr<Processor>`.** Members are destroyed in reverse
declaration order, so the store then dies last. Every host in `core/format` had it
backwards until 2026-07; the effect is nothing at all for a Processor with no
threads, and a use-after-free on plug-in close for one with a background thread that
reads `state().get_value()` while the destructor walks to its `join()`.

It crashes only on close, only sometimes, and the DAW gets the blame. The regression
test is `test/test_store_lifetime.cpp`; it observes the store's destruction through a
sentinel owned by a parameter's `to_string` closure rather than reading freed memory
and hoping the result looks wrong.

A Processor should not *rely* on this either: a worker thread that reads the store on
every tick is one host away from the same crash. Publish what the thread needs to
atomics from `process()` instead.

## Param text entry + gesture threading (PARAMS region)

- `params_text_to_value` must try `ParamInfo::from_string` BEFORE the generic
  numeric parse. from_string is the inverse of the `to_string` used by
  `value_to_text`, so a custom rendering ("quality=0.75", an enum label)
  round-trips; a bare strtod would reject it. CLAP values are plain (min..max),
  the same domain from_string returns — no normalization step. Guard the result
  with `std::isfinite` and fall through to the locale-independent strtod path on
  a non-finite parse. Keep the locale-independent fallback (`parse_double_c_locale`)
  for plain-numeric params. Test: `test/test_clap_entry.cpp`
  ("text_to_value routes through ParamInfo::from_string").
- CLAP delivers `CLAP_EVENT_PARAM_GESTURE_BEGIN/END` on the process/flush path
  and calls `store.begin_gesture/end_gesture` directly. Those StateStore entry
  points are main-thread-only (they forward to host undo grouping). A background
  writer must use `StateStore::run_gesture_on_main()` — see the state notes in
  `binding.hpp`.
## Editor resize contract (aspect-lock vs free reflow)

`gui_can_resize` returns resizable **iff `view_size().min_width>0 && min_height>0`** —
a plugin on the base-class default (`ViewSize{w,h,0,0,0,0}`) is fixed-size. Do NOT
naively "honor `aspect_ratio==0`" everywhere: that default returns `aspect_ratio==0`,
so a naive read flips *every* hand-authored plugin to free-reflow. The three cases the
GUI region dispatches (`gui_create`, `gui_get_resize_hints`, `gui_adjust_size`):

- **min==0 (not resizable):** keep the design-viewport pin at preferred (letterbox
  backstop for off-size panes). `gui_can_resize` already returns false.
- **resizable + `aspect_ratio>0`:** viewport + aspect lock; `preserve_aspect_ratio=true`;
  `gui_adjust_size` snaps to the design aspect (design-import plugins live here).
- **resizable + `aspect_ratio==0`:** free drag — **no** `set_design_viewport`, **no**
  `set_fixed_aspect_ratio`; `preserve_aspect_ratio=false`; `gui_adjust_size` clamps each
  axis to `[min,max]` independently with **no aspect snap**; the root reflows via Yoga at
  the host size.

The rule is `free = (min>0 && aspect_ratio==0)`. VST3's `PulpPlugView` mirrors it exactly
(`canResize`/`checkSizeConstraint`). Tests: the `[resize]` cases in
`test/test_clap_entry.cpp` build a `PulpClapPlugin` whose `bridge` is constructed
directly from a controlled `view_size()` (the `ViewBridge` ctor copies `view_size()` into
`size_hints_`, so no `gui_create`/attach is needed to exercise the negotiation math).
