description: >
  Use this skill when updating documentation, docstrings, or Markdown files
  across EMOD-Hub repositories. Works with both Sphinx (conf.py) and MkDocs
  (mkdocs.yml) projects. Triggers include: any request to update, audit, or
  migrate docs for EMOD-Hub / IDM repos, fix outdated references, remove pages
  or links to deprecated/retired resources (FAQ, EMOD-InputData,
  docs-emod-scenarios), update OS support language, fix package index URLs, or
  update GitHub org links. Covers .md, .rst, .txt, .py (docstrings), and
  similar text-based doc files, plus adding any doc-build dependencies the
  edits require (e.g. pyproject.toml docs extras, pymdownx.snippets auto_append
  for MkDocs). Do NOT use for code logic changes, CI/YAML pipelines, or
  non-documentation source files.

# EMOD-Hub Documentation Update Skill

This skill encodes the canonical rules for updating documentation, docstrings,
and Markdown files across EMOD-Hub repositories. It supports both **Sphinx**
(`docs/conf.py`) and **MkDocs** (`mkdocs.yml`) doc generators. Apply every
rule below to **every file you touch**. Rules are cumulative — a single file
may require several changes.

**Apply rules in order.** Rule 1 must run first — it creates `bib.md`, which
Rules 3 and 6 depend on to write new links correctly. Rule 7 must run last —
it closes the loop by adding any build dependencies that earlier rules have
caused the doc toolchain to need.

The user may provide one or more files, a repo path, or a description of the
docs to update. Produce clean, updated file content (or a diff) and clearly
summarise every change made.

---

## Preamble — Detect the Doc Generator *(do this before Rule 1)*

Before applying any rule, identify which doc generator the project uses, and
locate the doc tree. The choice changes how Rule 1 centralises links and what
dependencies Rule 7 may need to add.

**Detection rules**

1. **Sphinx** — the project contains `docs/conf.py` (or any `conf.py` whose
   directory holds `.rst` / `.md` source pages). The doc tree is the directory
   containing `conf.py`.
2. **MkDocs** — the project contains `mkdocs.yml` (or `mkdocs.yaml`) at the
   repo root. The doc tree is the directory referenced by `docs_dir:` in
   `mkdocs.yml` (default: `docs/`).
3. **Both** — some repos historically had Sphinx and have migrated (or are
   migrating) to MkDocs. Treat each tree separately and apply Rule 1 once
   per tree, with its own `bib.md`.
4. **Neither** — no `conf.py` and no `mkdocs.yml`. The repo has only
   standalone Markdown (root `README.md`, etc.). Skip Rule 1 entirely; Rules
   2–6 still apply but they rewrite URLs inline (per the standalone-file
   guidance in Rule 1's Scope section). Rule 7 has nothing to do.

**Why the generator matters for Rule 1**

Markdown reference-style links (`[text][label]` resolved by `[label]: URL`)
behave differently across renderers:

| Renderer | How `bib.md` is consumed |
|---|---|
| Sphinx + MyST | MyST reads every `.md` page in the doc tree; reference definitions in any one file resolve across the whole project, so a single `bib.md` "just works" once it lives in the doc tree. |
| MkDocs (default) | Reference definitions are scoped **per file**. A `bib.md` at `docs/` root will NOT propagate to other pages unless you wire it in. |
| MkDocs + `pymdownx.snippets` with `auto_append` | The snippets extension appends the listed file(s) to every rendered page, restoring the cross-page resolution behaviour. **This is the supported mechanism for centralised links in MkDocs projects.** |
| GitHub (renders `README.md`, etc. standalone) | Reference definitions are scoped per file. `bib.md` is invisible to them. |

**MkDocs precondition for Rule 1**

If the project uses MkDocs, before Rule 1 can centralise links, `mkdocs.yml`
must include the `pymdownx.snippets` extension with `auto_append` listing
`bib.md`. Example:

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.snippets:
      auto_append:
        - docs/bib.md
```

If this configuration is **missing**, add it as part of Rule 1's setup (and
record the dependency under Rule 7 if `pymdownx` is not already pulled in by
`mkdocs-material` or similar). If the user has explicitly opted out of
centralised links, fall back to keeping links inline and note this in the
`## Items to verify` section.

**What "doc tree" means in the rest of this skill**

Throughout this document, "the doc tree" or "in-tree" means whichever of the
following applies for the project:

- The directory containing `conf.py` (Sphinx).
- The directory referenced by `docs_dir:` in `mkdocs.yml`, default `docs/`
  (MkDocs).

Files **outside** the doc tree (root `README.md`, top-level
`tutorial_*.md`, `examples/**/README.md`, etc.) are "standalone" regardless
of generator — Rule 1 does not centralise their links.

---

## Rule 1 — Centralise *Selected* External Links into bib.md (in-tree only) *(run this first)*

**What to do**

A *subset* of external URLs in documentation files inside the doc tree
(Sphinx or MkDocs — see the Preamble for how to locate it) should be defined
once in a central `bib.md` file at the root of that doc directory, then
referenced by a short label in each doc. **`bib.md` is for shared / critical
/ unstable links only — not a sweep of every URL in the docs.** This rule
runs before all others so that Rules 3 and 6 can write any new links that
qualify directly into `bib.md` as reference-style links rather than inline.

**Inclusion criteria — only centralise a link if at least one is true**

1. The link **appears (or is likely to appear) in more than one doc page**.
2. The link is a **critical external dependency** — official API docs,
   specifications, language standards, or anything that an EMOD-Hub doc
   reader is repeatedly directed to.
3. The URL is **unstable or versioned** (e.g. `docs.someservice.com/v2/...`,
   release-tagged URLs, anything that may need to be re-pointed wholesale).

If none of these apply, **leave the link inline** — single-use stable URLs
(e.g. a one-off Docker install page, a one-off GitHub Codespaces help page,
a single CONTRIBUTING.md link) are easier to read and maintain inline than
through a bib.md round-trip. Adding low-value entries to `bib.md` adds noise
without payoff.

**Generator-specific precondition**

- **Sphinx + MyST:** no extra setup needed. MyST resolves Markdown
  reference definitions across the whole tree natively.
- **MkDocs:** `mkdocs.yml` must include `pymdownx.snippets` with
  `auto_append: [docs/bib.md]` (or whatever path holds `bib.md`). If absent,
  add it as part of this rule. Without it, labels defined in `bib.md` will
  not resolve in any other page. The `pymdownx` extensions ship with
  `pymdown-extensions`, which is already a transitive dependency of
  `mkdocs-material` — so usually no new dependency is needed, but verify
  under Rule 7 if the repo is not on `mkdocs-material`.

**Scope — what `bib.md` covers and what it does not**

`bib.md` is **only consulted by files inside the doc tree** (the directory
containing `conf.py` for Sphinx, or `docs_dir:` for MkDocs). It does not
propagate to standalone Markdown files outside that tree, because Markdown
reference definitions resolve **per-file** when rendered by GitHub or any
other non-doc-generator renderer.

Apply Rule 1 to:

- All `.md` files inside the doc tree (typically `docs/**/*.md`).

Do **not** apply Rule 1 to:

- Top-level repo files: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
  `getting_started.md`, `tutorial_*.md`, etc. These are rendered standalone
  by GitHub and have no access to `docs/bib.md`.
- READMEs inside non-doc directories: `examples/**/README.md`,
  `examples-container/**/README.md`, `.devcontainer/README.md`, etc.
- Any other `.md` file outside the directory containing `bib.md`.

For these standalone files, **keep links inline** (`[text](https://...)`).
If a standalone file already uses reference-style links, the reference
definitions must live at the bottom of that same file — never reach across
to `docs/bib.md`. Subsequent rules (3, 4, 5, 6) still apply to standalone
files; they just rewrite the URL in place rather than going through `bib.md`.

**Step 1 — Create or update `bib.md`**

If `bib.md` does not exist, create it at the root of the docs directory with
this structure:

```markdown
# Link Bibliography

All external URLs used across EMOD-Hub documentation.
Update links here; all docs reference this file by label.

[discussions]: https://github.com/orgs/EMOD-Hub/discussions
[emod-hub]: https://github.com/EMOD-Hub
<!-- add further entries below in alphabetical order by label -->
```

If `bib.md` already exists, append new entries — do not duplicate labels that
are already defined.

**Step 2 — Extract qualifying links from each in-scope `.md` file**

For each in-scope `.md` file (per the Scope section above — i.e. files inside
the doc tree):
- Find every inline link of the form `[text](https://...)` where the URL is an
  external address (starts with `http://` or `https://`).
- **Apply the inclusion criteria above.** Skip the link if it is single-use,
  stable, and not a critical external dependency.
- For links that qualify, choose a short, descriptive, lowercase hyphenated
  label (e.g. `emod-hub`, `discussions`, `pypi-emod-api`, `ubuntu-releases`).
- Add an entry to `bib.md`: `[label]: https://full-url-here`
- Replace the inline link in the doc with a reference-style link: `[text][label]`

A practical rule of thumb: scan the same URL across the whole doc tree
first. If it appears once, leave it inline. If it appears in two or more
files (or is the kind of canonical reference — discussion board, EMOD
docs landing page, official spec — that's likely to be linked again),
centralise it.

For standalone `.md` files outside the doc tree, **leave the inline link
in place**. Do not move them to `bib.md` — the labels would not resolve
when GitHub renders the file (and on MkDocs they would not resolve either,
since standalone files are typically not in `docs_dir`).

**Step 3 — Use reference-style links going forward (in-tree only, when criteria are met)**

Any new links introduced by subsequent rules in **in-scope** doc files
(e.g. the discussions board URL from Rule 3, the EMOD-Hub GitHub URL from
Rule 6) should be evaluated against the inclusion criteria. If they
qualify (they're likely multi-doc — `[discussions]` and `[emod-hub]`
typically do — or are critical external dependencies), add them to `bib.md`
and reference by label. If they don't qualify (a one-off URL only this page
will ever cite), keep them inline.

In **standalone** `.md` files, the same subsequent rules just rewrite the
URL inline. Do not introduce new `[label]:` definitions in standalone files
unless that file already uses the reference-style convention with its own
bottom-of-file definitions; in that case, add the new definition to the
same file (not to `docs/bib.md`).

**What NOT to move to bib.md**

- **Single-use stable URLs that aren't critical external deps** — e.g. a
  one-off Docker install page in a single installation doc, a single
  GitHub Codespaces help link in one tutorial, a one-off CONTRIBUTING.md
  link. Leave these inline.
- Links in standalone `.md` files outside the Sphinx doc tree (root
  `README.md`, top-level `tutorial_*.md`, `examples/**/README.md`, etc.) —
  these stay inline (see Scope section above).
- Internal relative links (e.g. `[see here](../install.md)`) stay inline.
- Anchor-only links (e.g. `[top](#top)`) stay inline.
- Image links `![alt](url)` stay inline.
- URLs inside code blocks and comments are left untouched.

**Examples**

```
# BEFORE — docs/intro.md (in-scope, inside the doc tree)
Please post questions on our
[discussion board](https://github.com/orgs/EMOD-Hub/discussions).
Clone the repo from [EMOD-Hub](https://github.com/EMOD-Hub).

# AFTER — docs/intro.md (reference-style, labels resolve via docs/bib.md)
Please post questions on our [discussion board][discussions].
Clone the repo from [EMOD-Hub][emod-hub].
```

```
# docs/bib.md (created or appended)
[discussions]: https://github.com/orgs/EMOD-Hub/discussions
[emod-hub]: https://github.com/EMOD-Hub
```

```yaml
# mkdocs.yml — required wiring for MkDocs projects
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.snippets:
      auto_append:
        - docs/bib.md
```

```
# BEFORE — README.md at repo root (out of scope, GitHub renders standalone)
Please email idm@gatesfoundation.org with questions.

# AFTER — README.md (Rule 3 still applies, but the link stays INLINE)
Please post your questions on our [discussion board](https://github.com/orgs/EMOD-Hub/discussions).
```

**Label naming conventions**

- Lowercase hyphenated slugs: `emod-api`, `ubuntu-releases`, `pypi-home`.
- Include the repo name for repo-specific links: `emod-api-repo`.
- Include context for versioned or page-specific links: `ubuntu-22-04-release`.
- If a label already exists in `bib.md` for the same URL, reuse it — do not
  create a duplicate.

## Rule 2 — Remove Pages and References to Deprecated or Retired Resources

**What to do**

Several documentation resources referenced by older EMOD-Hub docs are now
deprecated, retired, or archived. Delete any pages dedicated to them and remove
every link, `toctree` entry, include directive, `git clone` command, RST link
target (`.. _label:`), and prose mention that points at them.

This rule covers (at minimum) the resources in the table below. Treat the list
as additive — if you encounter another retired resource, follow the same
removal pattern.

| Resource | Status | What to find and remove |
|---|---|---|
| FAQ pages (`faq.md`, `FAQ.rst`, `frequently-asked-questions.*`) | Deprecated | Delete the file; remove every link, toctree entry, and "see the FAQ" sentence |
| `EMOD-InputData` GitHub repo | Archived 2026-02-19 — input files merged into main `EMOD` repo | Remove every URL containing `EMOD-InputData` (under any GitHub org), every `git clone .../EMOD-InputData.git` command, and prose paragraphs about downloading input data from this repo |
| `docs-emod-scenarios` GitHub repo | Retired — never migrated to EMOD-Hub | Remove every URL containing `docs-emod-scenarios` (under any GitHub org), every `.. _EMOD scenarios:` RST link target, and prose mentions of "EMOD scenarios releases" |

**How to remove cleanly**

- If a sentence exists only to point at one of these resources, delete the
  whole sentence.
- If a paragraph or section is primarily about one of these resources, delete
  the section heading and its body.
- If a `toctree` or `.. include::` directive references one of these, drop
  the entry. Do not leave a dangling include.
- If a sentence mixes a deprecated reference with still-relevant content, keep
  the relevant part and rewrite the sentence so it stands on its own.
- After removing an RST link target (`.. _label: URL`), grep for any remaining
  `` `label`_ `` references in the same file and remove or rephrase those too,
  otherwise Sphinx will warn about an unreferenced target.

**Examples — FAQ**

```
# BEFORE
For common questions, see the [FAQ page](faq.md).

# AFTER
(line removed)
```

```
# BEFORE (toctree in index.rst)
.. toctree::
   install
   faq
   contributing

# AFTER
.. toctree::
   install
   contributing
```

**Examples — EMOD-InputData**

```
# BEFORE (RST prose)
Clone the input data repository::

    git clone https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/EMOD-InputData.git

# AFTER
(entire paragraph and code block removed; if the surrounding section was only
about input data, drop the section heading too)
```

```
# BEFORE (inline RST link)
See the GitHub `EMOD-InputData <https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/EMOD-InputData>`_ repository for sample demographics files.

# AFTER
(sentence removed; sample demographics now live in the main EMOD repo, so
either drop the reference entirely or rewrite to point at the relevant
in-repo path if known)
```

**Examples — docs-emod-scenarios**

```
# BEFORE (RST link target)
.. _EMOD scenarios: https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/docs-emod-scenarios/releases

# AFTER
(line removed; also remove every `EMOD scenarios`_ reference elsewhere in the
file — Sphinx will warn about unreferenced targets if you leave them)
```

```
# BEFORE (prose)
For example scenarios, see the `EMOD scenarios`_ releases on GitHub.

# AFTER
(sentence removed)
```

---

## Rule 3 — Replace the IDM Support Email with the Discussion Board URL

**What to do**

- Find every occurrence of the email address `idm@gatesfoundation.org`
  (in any form: bare address, mailto link, inline text, docstring, comment).
- Replace it with a reference-style link using the `[discussions]` label
  already defined in `bib.md` by Rule 1.
- Reword the surrounding sentence naturally so it reads as a pointer to the
  discussion board, not an email address. Do not leave "email us at" or
  "contact us at" language attached to the new link.

**Examples**

```
# BEFORE
Please email idm@gatesfoundation.org with questions.

# AFTER
Please post your questions on our [discussion board][discussions].
```

```
# BEFORE
For support, contact us at idm@gatesfoundation.org.

# AFTER
For support, visit our [discussion board][discussions].
```

---

## Rule 4 — Update Supported Operating System from CentOS to Ubuntu 22.04

**What to do**

- Find every mention of CentOS (any version, any capitalisation: `CentOS`,
  `centos`, `CentOS 7`, `CentOS Linux`, etc.) used to describe the
  **officially supported** or **recommended** OS.
- Replace with **Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish)**.
- Also replace any older Ubuntu versions (e.g. `Ubuntu 20.04`, `Ubuntu 18.04`)
  used as the recommended OS with `Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish)`.
- Update any version-specific language (e.g. "CentOS 7 or later") to simply
  reference Ubuntu 22.04 unless the docs explicitly discuss multiple distros.
- If a doc lists CentOS alongside other distros for informational purposes,
  remove CentOS from that list and add Ubuntu 22.04 if it is not already there.
- Update any related instructions (package manager commands, paths, etc.) that
  were CentOS/RHEL-specific to their Ubuntu/Debian equivalents where possible.

**Examples**

```
# BEFORE
EMOD is officially supported on CentOS 7.

# AFTER
EMOD is officially supported on Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish).
```

```
# BEFORE
Tested on: CentOS 7, Ubuntu 18.04

# AFTER
Tested on: Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish)
```

```
# BEFORE (install command)
sudo yum install python3

# AFTER
sudo apt-get install python3
```

---

## Rule 5 — Remove the Custom Package Index URL (packages.idmod.org)

**What to do**

- Find every reference to `https://packages.idmod.org/` (or any sub-path of
  it) used as a pip `--index-url`, `--extra-index-url`, `-i` flag, or in
  `pip.conf` / `requirements.txt` / `setup.cfg` / `pyproject.toml` docs.
- **Remove** the flag and URL entirely. All packages are now on PyPI; no
  custom index is needed.
- If the surrounding sentence or code block only existed to explain the custom
  index, remove that sentence/block too.
- Do not replace the URL with PyPI's default URL — simply omit it, since pip
  uses PyPI by default.

**Examples**

```
# BEFORE
pip install emod-api --index-url=https://packages.idmod.org/api/pypi/pypi-production/simple

# AFTER
pip install emod-api
```

```
# BEFORE
[global]
index-url = https://packages.idmod.org/api/pypi/pypi-production/simple

# AFTER
(section removed — pip uses PyPI by default)
```

```
# BEFORE
Packages are hosted at https://packages.idmod.org/. Install using:
pip install emod-api -i https://packages.idmod.org/api/pypi/pypi-production/simple

# AFTER
Install using:
pip install emod-api
```

---

## Rule 6 — Update GitHub Organisation from InstituteforDiseaseModeling to EMOD-Hub

**What to do**

- Find every URL or reference that uses the old GitHub organisation path
  `github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/` and replace it with
  `github.com/EMOD-Hub/`.
- This applies to:
  - Hyperlinks in Markdown (`[text](https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/repo)`)
  - RST hyperlinks and `.. _label: URL` directives
  - Bare URLs in prose or docstrings
  - `git clone` commands
  - `pip install git+https://...` URLs
  - Badge URLs (shields.io, readthedocs, etc.) that embed the org name
- After updating the URL, evaluate it against Rule 1's inclusion criteria.
  If it qualifies (multi-doc, critical external dep, or unstable/versioned),
  add it to `bib.md` and use a reference-style link. Otherwise keep the
  rewritten URL inline.
- Preserve the repository name (the part after the org) exactly as-is; only
  the org segment changes.
- **Exception — issue links:** If the URL points to a specific issue or pull
  request (i.e. the path contains `/issues/` or `/pull/`), leave the URL
  completely unchanged. Issue numbers are tied to the original repository
  history and may not map correctly after an org move.
- **Exception — repo not migrated to EMOD-Hub:** Before rewriting a repo URL,
  verify the repo actually exists under `github.com/EMOD-Hub/<repo>`. If it
  does not (retired, renamed, or never migrated), **prefer removing the
  reference** under Rule 2's removal pattern rather than rewriting it or
  leaving a stale `InstituteforDiseaseModeling` URL behind. Only keep the
  original URL if the reference is still load-bearing for the doc and no
  EMOD-Hub equivalent exists; in that case, flag it in the `## Items to
  verify` section so the user can confirm. Do not leave `TODO` comments in
  the final file output.

**Examples**

```
# BEFORE
git clone https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/emod-api.git

# AFTER
git clone https://github.com/EMOD-Hub/emod-api.git
```

```
# BEFORE (inline Markdown link)
See the [emod-api](https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/emod-api) repo.

# AFTER (reference-style, bib.md updated)
See the [emod-api][emod-api-repo] repo.
```

```
# BEFORE
[![Build](https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/emod-api/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)]
(https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/emod-api/actions/workflows/test.yml)

# AFTER
[![Build](https://github.com/EMOD-Hub/emod-api/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)]
(https://github.com/EMOD-Hub/emod-api/actions/workflows/test.yml)
```

```
# BEFORE (issue link — leave untouched)
See https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/emod-api/issues/42 for context.

# AFTER (no change)
See https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/emod-api/issues/42 for context.
```

## Rule 7 — Add Build Dependencies Required by Doc Changes *(run this last)*

**What to do**

Some edits introduced by Rules 1–6 can cause the doc toolchain (Sphinx + MyST
**or** MkDocs + plugins) to need a package it did not need before. If a rule
adds a new kind of source file (for example, the first `.md` file from Rule 1
in a previously RST-only Sphinx project) or begins to exercise a toolchain
feature that was configured but never actually triggered (e.g. a MyST
extension listed in `conf.py` or an MkDocs plugin listed in `mkdocs.yml`
whose backing package was never installed), the doc build will start failing
with a `ModuleNotFoundError` or similar missing-dependency error.

For **every rule that fires**, ask: "does this change cause the doc build to
need something new?" If yes, add the dependency in the same PR.

**Where to add the dependency**

Add it to the project's documentation dependency set, in this order of
preference (use whichever the repo already uses):

1. `pyproject.toml` under `[project.optional-dependencies].docs` — the canonical
   location in modern EMOD-Hub repos. CI installs via `pip install .[docs]`.
2. `setup.py` / `setup.cfg` under `extras_require={"docs": [...]}` — older
   repos.
3. `docs/requirements.txt` — if the repo uses a dedicated requirements file
   for docs.

Pin loosely (compatible-release `~=`) to match the repo's existing style.
Prefer the extras-style form (e.g. `myst-parser[linkify]`, `mkdocs-material[imaging]`)
over adding a separate top-level dependency, since extras keep related
packages co-versioned.

**When this rule fires**

Common triggers seen in practice:

*Sphinx / MyST projects*

| Earlier change | New dependency needed | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Rule 1 creates the first `.md` file in a previously RST-only project, and `conf.py` already enables the MyST `linkify` extension | `myst-parser[linkify]` (pulls in `linkify-it-py`) | MyST only processes Markdown, so the `linkify` extension was dormant until a `.md` file existed. First Markdown doc causes `ModuleNotFoundError: Linkify enabled but not installed.` |
| Adding a notebook (`.ipynb`) to the doc tree | `nbsphinx` or `myst-nb` | Sphinx needs a parser for notebook source files. |
| Adding Mermaid / PlantUML diagrams | `sphinxcontrib-mermaid` / `plantweb` | Diagram directives fail without their backing extension. |
| Adding dollar-math or AMS-math in `.md` files | `myst-parser[linkify]` is not enough — ensure `myst_enable_extensions` has `dollarmath`/`amsmath` and the MyST version supports them | Math extensions are built into `myst-parser` but must be enabled. No new package, but verify `conf.py`. |

*MkDocs projects*

| Earlier change | New dependency needed | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Rule 1 wires up `pymdownx.snippets` `auto_append` for the first time and the repo is **not** on `mkdocs-material` | `pymdown-extensions` | `pymdownx.*` extensions live in this package; `mkdocs-material` already depends on it transitively, but a bare `mkdocs` install does not. |
| Adding API auto-docs via `mkdocs-autoapi` | `mkdocs-autoapi`, `mkdocstrings`, `mkdocstrings-python` | Required to generate auto-API pages. |
| Adding admonitions / tabs / Mermaid in MkDocs | `mkdocs-material` (or `mkdocs-mermaid2-plugin`) | Material theme provides most extensions; bare MkDocs does not. |
| Adding Jupyter notebooks to the MkDocs doc tree | `mkdocs-jupyter` | Required to render `.ipynb` source pages. |
| Adding `include-markdown:` plugin usage (Rule 2 cleanups that previously inlined a removed file) | `mkdocs-include-markdown-plugin` | Plugin must be installed if it's listed under `plugins:` in `mkdocs.yml`. |
| Adding Mermaid / PlantUML diagrams to `.md` pages | `mkdocs-mermaid2-plugin` (or equivalent) | Plugin must be present for `mermaid` fenced blocks to render. |

**How to verify**

After adding the dependency:

1. Confirm the dependency file change (show the diff).
2. Confirm the doc-build CI workflow installs via the same extras set you
   updated. Common workflow files:
   - Sphinx: `.github/workflows/sphinx.yml`, `.github/workflows/docs.yml`,
     ReadTheDocs `.readthedocs.yaml` (where `python.install` references
     `extra_requirements: [docs]`).
   - MkDocs: `.github/workflows/mkdocs_build.yml`,
     `.github/workflows/mkdocs_deploy.yml`.

   If the workflow uses `pip install .[docs]` the change flows through
   automatically; if it uses a pinned `requirements.txt`, that file needs
   updating too.
3. If you can run the build locally, do so and verify no `ModuleNotFoundError`:
   - Sphinx: `sphinx-build -b html docs/ docs/_build/html` (or `make html`).
   - MkDocs: `mkdocs build --strict` (the `--strict` flag turns warnings into
     errors and catches missing-plugin issues immediately).

**Example A — Sphinx Linkify**

A repo that previously had only `.rst` docs adds `docs/bib.md` as part of
Rule 1. `docs/conf.py` already contains:

```python
myst_enable_extensions = [
    ...,
    "linkify",
    ...,
]
```

The next doc build fails on GitHub Actions with:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: Linkify enabled but not installed.
```

Because the `linkify` MyST extension requires the `linkify-it-py` package,
which ships as an optional extra of `myst-parser`. Fix in `pyproject.toml`:

```diff
 docs = [
     ...
-    "myst-parser~=2.0",
+    "myst-parser[linkify]~=2.0",
     ...
 ]
```

No workflow change is needed because the docs CI installs via
`pip install .[docs]`. The next build succeeds.

**Example B — MkDocs `pymdownx.snippets` for centralised links**

A bare MkDocs repo (no `mkdocs-material`) adopts Rule 1 by adding to
`mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.snippets:
      auto_append:
        - docs/bib.md
```

The next `mkdocs build` fails with:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pymdownx'
```

Fix in `pyproject.toml`:

```diff
 docs = [
     "mkdocs",
+    "pymdown-extensions",
     ...
 ]
```

If the project already uses `mkdocs-material`, this is unnecessary — the
material theme pulls `pymdown-extensions` in transitively.

**What NOT to do**

- Do not add dependencies speculatively. Only add what an actually-failing
  build (or a build you can predict will fail from the configuration) needs.
- Do not pin exact versions unless the repo already uses exact pins.
- Do not add a runtime dependency (top-level `dependencies` in
  `pyproject.toml`) for a docs-only package — keep it scoped to the `docs`
  extra.

## Verification Checklist

After applying all rules, confirm the following before returning the updated
files:

| Check | Expected result |
|---|---|
| Doc generator detected (Sphinx `conf.py` or MkDocs `mkdocs.yml`) | Generator identified; doc-tree root located before applying Rule 1 |
| `bib.md` exists at doc-tree root | Present and contains every link that meets Rule 1's inclusion criteria; single-use stable URLs are correctly left inline |
| (MkDocs only) `pymdownx.snippets` `auto_append` includes `bib.md` | Configured in `mkdocs.yml`, otherwise reference labels will not resolve |
| Search for `faq` (case-insensitive) | No remaining links or toctree entries pointing to an FAQ page |
| Search for `EMOD-InputData` | Zero occurrences (repo is archived; references should be removed per Rule 2) |
| Search for `docs-emod-scenarios` | Zero occurrences (repo retired; references should be removed per Rule 2) |
| Search for `idm@gatesfoundation.org` | Zero occurrences |
| Search for `CentOS` (case-insensitive) | Zero occurrences |
| Search for `packages.idmod.org` | Zero occurrences |
| Search for `InstituteforDiseaseModeling` | Zero occurrences (except `/issues/` and `/pull/` URLs) |
| Inline external links `](http` in in-tree `.md` files (the doc tree only — Sphinx or MkDocs) | Each remaining inline link is justified — it failed Rule 1's inclusion criteria (single-use, stable, not a critical external dep). Multi-doc / critical / unstable URLs have been moved to `bib.md`. Standalone `.md` files outside the doc tree are exempt — inline links there are always correct. |
| All surviving links resolve logically | No broken anchors introduced by removals |
| Doc build dependencies cover all new file types / toolchain features (Rule 7) | `pyproject.toml` (or equivalent) lists every package the doc build now needs (Sphinx + MyST extras OR MkDocs plugins) |

## Output Format

When returning updated files or diffs:

1. **State which rules fired** on each file (e.g. "Applied rules 3, 5, 6").
2. Provide the **full updated file** or a clearly readable **unified diff**.
3. Always include the final `bib.md` in the output, even if only a few entries
   were added.
4. If a file required no changes, say so explicitly — do not silently skip it.
5. If any ambiguous case required a judgment call (e.g. a repo name that does
   not appear under EMOD-Hub), **flag it** with a `<!-- TODO: verify -->` HTML
   comment or an inline note, and explain the ambiguity to the user.
6. **Surface all open items at the end of the output under a `## Items to
   verify` section.** If you left any `TODO`, `<!-- TODO: verify -->`, or
   other "needs user confirmation" markers in the files, or made any judgment
   call that the user should double-check, list every one of them in a
   bulleted checklist at the bottom of the response. Each bullet must
   include:
   - the **file path and line number** (or a clear locator),
   - the **exact marker / snippet** left behind,
   - a **one-line question or action** for the user (e.g. "confirm repo
     `<name>` exists under EMOD-Hub; if not, revert URL to
     `InstituteforDiseaseModeling`").

   If there are zero open items, write `## Items to verify` followed by
   `None — all rules applied cleanly.` so the user knows nothing was deferred.
   Never leave TODO markers buried silently in the files without surfacing
   them here.

   **Example**

   ```markdown
   ## Items to verify

   - `docs/emod/foo.rst:42` — left `<!-- TODO: verify -->` on
     `https://github.com/EMOD-Hub/some-repo`. Please confirm `some-repo`
     exists under EMOD-Hub; if not, revert to `InstituteforDiseaseModeling`.
   - `docs/install.md:17` — replaced `CentOS 7` with `Ubuntu 22.04`, but the
     surrounding paragraph still references a CentOS-specific package path.
     Please confirm the Ubuntu equivalent is correct.
   ```
