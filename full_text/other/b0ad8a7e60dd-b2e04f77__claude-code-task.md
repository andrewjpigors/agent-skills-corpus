# Claude Code Task (Async)

Run Claude Code in background — zero OpenClaw tokens while it works. Results delivered to WhatsApp or Telegram automatically.

## Important: Claude Code = General AI Agent

Claude Code is NOT just a coding tool. It's a full-powered AI agent with web search, file access, and deep reasoning. Use it for ANY complex task:

- **Research** — web search, synthesis, competitive analysis, user experience reports, deep research, evidence gathering, tradeoff studies, sanctions/KYC/AML investigations
- **Coding** — create tools, scripts, APIs, refactor codebases
- **Analysis** — read and analyze files, data, logs, source code
- **Content** — write docs, presentations, reports, summaries
- **Automations** — complex multi-step workflows with file system access

Give it prompts the same way you'd talk to a smart human — natural language, focused on WHAT you need, not HOW to do it.

**NOT for:**
- Quick questions (just answer directly)
- Tasks needing real-time interaction

## Quick Start

## What "run tests" means for this skill (critical)

When user asks things like:
- "прогони все тесты"
- "run tests"
- "проверь что всё работает"

it means **run the full E2E operator validation flow** for `run-task.py` routing + notifications.

It does **NOT** mean `pytest`/`unittest` discovery by default.

Required behavior:
1. Run routing validation first (`--validate-only`).
2. Launch smoke/E2E scenario via `nohup` and file-based prompt.
3. Wait for completion through normal async flow (wake/event), not same-turn blocking.
4. Report PASS/FAIL against E2E criteria (routing, heartbeat, mid-task update, completion delivery).

Use the canonical protocol: **[references/testing-protocol.md](references/testing-protocol.md)** and the section below **Full E2E Test (reference)**.

## Async Boundary Rule (mandatory)

`run-task.py` is asynchronous orchestration.

After a successful `nohup` launch, the correct behavior is:
1. Send a short launch acknowledgment (PID/log/session + a brief human-written summary of what you asked Claude to do), then
2. **Stop this turn immediately**.
3. Continue only when wake/completion event arrives in the same session.

Do **not** keep waiting in the same turn for Claude Code completion.
Do **not** poll and then summarize in the same turn unless user explicitly asked for active live monitoring.

Anti-pattern:
- ❌ Launch `run-task.py` and keep responding as if completion should appear in this turn.

Correct pattern:
- ✅ Launch `run-task.py` → acknowledge launch → stop → wait for wake.

## Launch Confirmation Gate (mandatory)

Never claim "launched" until you have **positive launch proof**.

Required proof checklist (all):
1. `nohup` command returned a PID,
2. process is alive (`ps -p <PID>`),
3. run log contains `🔧 Starting Claude Code...` (or equivalent startup marker),
4. routing was validated (`--validate-only`) for Telegram thread runs.

If launch fails with `❌ Invalid routing`:
- resolve via `sessions_list`,
- rerun with explicit `--notify-channel telegram --notify-thread-id <id> --notify-session-id <uuid>`,
- re-check proof checklist,
- only then send launch acknowledgment.

Do not send "Claude Code ушёл в работу" before this gate is satisfied.

Important: in your own launch acknowledgment, do **not** restate the full raw prompt.
- Give only a short human summary of the task.
- The run-task launch notification already includes the full prompt/body when needed.
- Avoid duplicating large prompt text in the visible agent reply.

## Pre-launch planning note (mandatory)

Before launching Claude Code, post a short plan in chat:
- how you plan to solve the task,
- what result you expect from this run,
- any clarifying questions/assumptions,
- whether you expect a single-pass result or a staged multi-step approach.

If staged: explicitly say this run is "phase 1" and what signal will decide phase 2.

## Telegram Thread Safety (must-follow)

For Telegram thread runs, `run-task.py` is designed to either route correctly or fail immediately.

### Mandatory step before launch
Resolve the **current runtime session key** first (source of truth), then launch with it.

- Get current key via `sessions_list` (or existing runtime context)
- If key is `agent:main:main:thread:<THREAD_ID>` → use it directly in `--session`
- Never derive `--session` from `chat_id`/sender id heuristics

### Rules
- Use only `--session "agent:main:main:thread:<THREAD_ID>"` for thread tasks
- Never use `agent:main:telegram:user:<id>` for thread tasks
- If routing metadata is inconsistent (thread/session UUID/target mismatch), script exits with `❌ Invalid routing`
- Default mode is `--telegram-routing-mode auto`:
  - allows non-thread Telegram for setups without thread sessions
  - blocks ambiguous user-scope session key (`agent:main:telegram:user:<id>`) unless explicitly forced
  - blocks non-thread launch if a recent thread session exists for same target (likely misroute)
- Force strict thread-only behavior with `--telegram-routing-mode thread-only`
- Force non-thread behavior with `--telegram-routing-mode allow-non-thread` or `--allow-main-telegram`

This is intentional: **abort fast > silent misroute**.

⚠️ For background `claude-code-task` launches, **do not set `exec.timeout`**; use only `run-task.py --timeout`, otherwise OpenClaw may SIGTERM the whole process group early.

⚠️ **NEVER put the task text directly in the shell command** — quotes, special characters, and newlines WILL break argument parsing. Always save the prompt to a file first, then use `$(cat file)`.

### WhatsApp

```bash
# Step 1: Save prompt to a temp file
write /tmp/cc-prompt.txt with your task text

# Step 2: Launch with $(cat ...)
nohup python3 {baseDir}/run-task.py \
  --task "$(cat /tmp/cc-prompt.txt)" \
  --project ~/projects/my-project \
  --session "agent:main:whatsapp:group:<JID>" \
  --timeout 900 \
  > /tmp/cc-run.log 2>&1 &
```

The `--session` key (e.g. `agent:main:whatsapp:group:120363425246977860@g.us`) is used to auto-detect the WhatsApp target.

### Telegram (thread-safe default)

```bash
# ALWAYS use the current thread session key from context:
# agent:main:main:thread:<THREAD_ID>
nohup python3 {baseDir}/run-task.py \
  --task "$(cat /tmp/cc-prompt.txt)" \
  --project ~/projects/my-project \
  --session "agent:main:main:thread:<THREAD_ID>" \
  --timeout 900 \
  > /tmp/cc-run.log 2>&1 &
```

> Do **NOT** use `agent:main:telegram:user:<id>` for thread tests/runs.
> That routes to main chat scope and can drift from the source thread.

### Telegram Threaded Mode (1:1 DM with threads)

When Marvin is used in Telegram Threaded Mode, each thread has its own session key like `agent:main:main:thread:369520`.

**Fail-safe routing (NEW):** `run-task.py` now enforces strict thread routing.
- If `--session` contains `:thread:<id>`, the script **refuses to start** unless Telegram target + thread session UUID are resolved.
- It auto-resolves missing values from `sessions_list` when possible.
- If the session is inactive and not returned by API, it falls back to local session files: `~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/*-topic-<thread_id>.jsonl`.
- If provided `--notify-session-id` mismatches the session key, it exits with error.
- Result: misrouted launches/heartbeats to main chat are blocked before Claude starts.

Use `--notify-session-id` to wake the exact thread session:

```bash
nohup python3 {baseDir}/run-task.py \
  --task "$(cat /tmp/cc-prompt.txt)" \
  --project ~/projects/my-project \
  --session "agent:main:main:thread:369520" \
  --timeout 900 \
  > /tmp/cc-run.log 2>&1 &
```

All 5 notification types route to the DM thread when `--session` key contains `:thread:<id>` ✅

- `--notify-session-id` — optional override. Usually auto-resolved from session metadata/files.
- `--notify-thread-id` — optional override. Usually auto-extracted from `--session`.
- `--reply-to-message-id` — optional debug field; avoid for DM thread routing.
- `--validate-only` — resolve routing and exit (no Claude run). Use this to verify thread launch args safely.

- `--notify-channel` — optional channel hint (`telegram`/`whatsapp`); target is always auto-resolved from session metadata
- `--timeout` — max runtime in seconds (default: 7200 = 2 hours)
- built-in smart stall observer (shadow mode): sends "would terminate" warnings on likely hangs
- built-in post-result tail-hang detector (short grace after result event)
- `--trace-live` — emit live technical trace markers into the same chat/thread (debug mode)
- Always redirect stdout/stderr to a log file

### Why file-based prompts?
Research/complex prompts contain single quotes, double quotes, markdown, backticks — any of these break shell argument parsing. Saving to a file and reading with `$(cat ...)` avoids all quoting issues.

## Channel Detection

The `detect_channel()` function determines where to send notifications:

1. **Deterministic auto-resolve** — target is resolved from session metadata/session key (no manual target flag)
2. **WhatsApp auto-detect** — if the session key contains `@g.us` (WhatsApp group JID), WhatsApp is used
3. **Fail fast on unresolved Telegram target** — script exits with `❌ Invalid routing` instead of silent misroute

```python
def detect_channel(session_key):
    if NOTIFY_CHANNEL_OVERRIDE and NOTIFY_TARGET_OVERRIDE:
        return NOTIFY_CHANNEL_OVERRIDE, NOTIFY_TARGET_OVERRIDE
    jid = extract_group_jid(session_key)
    if jid:
        return "whatsapp", jid
    return None, None
```

```

### WhatsApp notification flow:
1. **Heartbeat pings** (every 60s) → WhatsApp direct (informational, no agent wake)
2. **Final result** → WhatsApp direct (human sees immediately) + `sessions_send` (agent wakes up)
3. **Agent receives** completion payload via sessions_send → processes it → sends summary via `message(send)` to WhatsApp group
4. Human sees both: raw result + agent's analysis/next steps

### Wake continuation behavior
Wake payload frames continuation as the **same ongoing assistant conversation** (same agent identity, same session, same history) after Claude Code replies to the previous launch.

Continuation flow:
- react briefly to Claude result
- evaluate goal completion (gap analysis)
- if gaps remain and there is no real blocker requiring user input or external waiting: explain the next fix, then launch the next Claude run in the same turn
- keep repeating this wake → visible decision → relaunch pattern for as many iterations as needed until the original goal is complete or a genuine blocker is hit
- if complete: report final outcome and stop

### Deterministic wake guard (anti-duplicate)
- Each run now carries `run_id` and `wake_id` in wake payload.
- `run-task.py` keeps per-project state in `/tmp/cc-orchestrator-state-<hash>.json`.
- Duplicate/stale wake dispatches (same output or same wake_id) are skipped before wake delivery.
- In debug mode (`--trace-live`), skipped wakes are announced as `[TRACE][TECH][TELEGRAM][WAKE][SKIP]`.

### No silent launch policy (always-on)
- Silent launch is forbidden (not only in debug mode).
- On wake, agent must first post a visible decision turn:
  - `[TRACE][AGENT][WAKE_RECEIVED] ...`
  - `[TRACE][AGENT][DECISION] continue|stop ...`
- If the goal is still not complete and there is no real blocker, the next Claude iteration is mandatory.
- Only after that visible decision may the next Claude iteration be launched.
### Telegram notification flow (DM Threaded Mode — full pipeline):
1. 🚀 **Launch notification** → thread ✅ (silent; HTML; `<blockquote expandable>` for prompt; via `send_telegram_direct`; includes `Resume: <session-id|new>`)
2. ⏳ **Heartbeat** (every 60s) → thread ✅ (silent; plain text; via `send_telegram_direct`)
3. 📡 **Claude Code mid-task updates** → thread ✅ (on-disk Python script `/tmp/cc-notify-{pid}.py`; CC calls file; prefix `"📡 🟢 CC: "` auto-added)
4. ✅/❌/⏰/💥 **Result notification** → thread ✅ (HTML; `<blockquote expandable>` for result; via `send_telegram_direct`)
5. 🤖 **Agent continuation reply** → delivered to chat via `openclaw agent --deliver` ✅ (same session continuation is visible to user)

**`send_telegram_direct()`** is the core mechanism for all thread-targeted notifications from external scripts. It calls `api.telegram.org` directly with `message_thread_id` — bypasses the OpenClaw message tool entirely (which cannot route to DM threads from outside a session context).

**Fallback** — if agent wake fails (session locked/busy): `already_sent=True` is set after the direct send, so no duplicate is sent.

### Key detail: Telegram vs WhatsApp delivery

**WhatsApp:** Raw result sent directly (human sees it immediately) + `sessions_send` wakes agent for analysis.

**Telegram:** Result sent via `send_telegram_direct` → then agent is woken via `openclaw agent --session-id --deliver` so the continuation turn is visible in chat by default. This is the intended “same agent, same conversation” behavior after Claude completion.

**Why not `sessions_send` for Telegram?** `sessions_send` is blocked in the HTTP `/tools/invoke` deny list by architectural design. The `openclaw agent` CLI bypasses this limitation.

## Reliability Features

### Timeout / stall protection
- `--timeout 7200` → hard max runtime (SIGTERM → wait 10s → SIGKILL)
- built-in smart stall observer (shadow mode): warns when run looks kill-worthy but does not terminate
- built-in post-result tail-hang detector: warns when process stays alive after result event grace
- Timeout/stall notification sent to channel with tool call count and last activity
- Partial output saved to file

### Crash safety
- `try/except` wraps entire main → crash notification always sent
- Both channel notification and agent wake attempted on any failure

### PID tracking
- PID file written to `skills/claude-code-task/pids/`
- Stale PIDs cleaned on startup
- Can check running tasks: `ls skills/claude-code-task/pids/`

### Silent mode (Telegram only)
Telegram supports silent notifications (no sound).

Current policy: **all Claude Code notifications are silent** in Telegram:
- Heartbeat pings → `silent=True`
- Launch notifications → `silent=True`
- Mid-task updates (`📡 🟢 CC`) → `silent=True`
- Final results → `silent=True`
- Wake-summary instruction requests `silent=True`

WhatsApp does NOT support silent mode — the flag is ignored for WhatsApp.

### Telegram DM Threads vs Forum Groups

Telegram has two distinct thread models. The key difference for run-task.py is how to route messages to the thread.

**The core problem with external scripts:**
- The OpenClaw `message` tool's `threadId` parameter is **Discord-specific** — ignored for Telegram
- Target format `"chatId:topic:threadId"` is rejected by the message tool's target resolver
- Session auto-routing (`currentThreadTs`) works ONLY inside active sessions — external scripts have no session context
- **Solution:** `send_telegram_direct()` bypasses the message tool entirely; calls `api.telegram.org` directly with `message_thread_id`

**DM Threaded Mode** (bot-user private chat with threads):
- All notifications use `send_telegram_direct(chat_id, text, thread_id=..., parse_mode=...)` ✅
- `thread_id` auto-extracted from session key `*:thread:<id>` by `extract_thread_id()`
- Launch + finish: `parse_mode="HTML"` with `<blockquote expandable>` for prompt/result
- Heartbeats + mid-task: `parse_mode=None` (plain text, avoid Markdown parse errors)
- **`parse_mode="Markdown"` trap**: finish messages contain `**text**` (CommonMark bold); Telegram MarkdownV1 rejects this with HTTP 400 — messages silently don't arrive
- **`replyTo` trap**: combining `replyTo` + `message_thread_id` → Telegram rejects request → fallback strips thread_id → message lands in main chat
- Agent continuation reply: `openclaw agent --session-id <uuid> --deliver` publishes the wake turn to chat so the user sees the same ongoing assistant conversation.

**Forum Groups** (supergroup with Forum topics enabled):
- Same `send_telegram_direct()` approach works; `message_thread_id` is standard Bot API for Forum topics
- Auto-detected from session key pattern `*:thread:<id>`

**Claude Code mid-task updates:**
- DO NOT embed bot tokens or curl commands in the task prompt — Claude Code flags this as prompt injection
- run-task.py writes `/tmp/cc-notify-{pid}.py` to disk before launching Claude Code
- Task prompt prepended with `[Automation context: ... python3 /tmp/cc-notify-{pid}.py 'msg' ...]`
- Claude Code calls the file (legitimate local script pattern, no safety warning)
- Script automatically prepends `"📡 🟢 CC: "` to all messages; cleaned up in `finally` block
- The same local script interface is now used for both Telegram and WhatsApp; transport differences stay inside the generated script

### Notification types

| Event | Emoji | WhatsApp delivery | Telegram delivery | DM thread? |
|-------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Launch | 🚀 | send_channel (Markdown) | send_telegram_direct (HTML, silent) | ✅ message_thread_id |
| Heartbeat | ⏳ | send_channel (Markdown) | send_telegram_direct (plain, silent) | ✅ message_thread_id |
| CC mid-task update | 📡 | — | /tmp/cc-notify-{pid}.py (Bot API, silent) | ✅ message_thread_id |
| Success | ✅ | send_channel + sessions_send | send_telegram_direct (HTML) + openclaw agent | ✅ message_thread_id |
| Error | ❌ | send_channel + sessions_send | send_telegram_direct (HTML) + openclaw agent | ✅ message_thread_id |
| Timeout | ⏰ | send_channel + sessions_send | send_telegram_direct (HTML) + openclaw agent | ✅ message_thread_id |
| Crash | 💥 | send_channel + sessions_send | send_telegram_direct (HTML) + openclaw agent | ✅ message_thread_id |
| Agent continuation reply | 🤖 | — | openclaw agent wake (`--deliver`) | ✅ visible in chat |

## Execution Modes

The wrapper exposes exactly two execution modes. No advisory flags.

Hard billing invariant: `run-task.py` always strips `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the Claude Code child process environment. Claude Code task runs must use the logged-in subscription/OAuth path, never direct API-key billing.

### Standard (default)
No explicit model flag. The claude CLI picks its current default model.

```bash
nohup python3 {baseDir}/run-task.py \
  --task "$(cat /tmp/prompt.txt)" \
  --project ~/projects/x \
  --session "agent:main:main:thread:<THREAD_ID>" \
  > /tmp/cc-run.log 2>&1 &
```

### Fast (`--fast`)
Requests true Claude Code Fast mode through the subscription/OAuth path.

⚠️ Cost guard: Fast mode can cost about **$30 per 10 minutes of continuous work**. Use it **ONLY when the user explicitly asks for `--fast`, "Fast mode", or "быстрый режим".** Do not infer it from task importance, urgency/"срочно", long duration, or your own desire to finish sooner. Default to standard mode for every Claude Code launch unless Fast mode is explicitly requested.

Implementation detail: when the installed Claude CLI exposes native `claude -p --fast`, the wrapper uses it. On local Claude Code 2.1.119, `--fast` is not a recognized pipe-mode flag yet, but `--settings '{"fastMode":true}' --model claude-opus-4-6` works when Claude Code uses the logged-in OAuth/subscription session. The wrapper strips `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` automatically for both standard and fast runs.

```bash
nohup python3 {baseDir}/run-task.py \
  --task "$(cat /tmp/prompt.txt)" \
  --project ~/projects/x \
  --session "agent:main:main:thread:<THREAD_ID>" \
  --fast \
  > /tmp/cc-run.log 2>&1 &
```

The wrapper does not map fast mode to `--effort low`. That is a different mechanism. If Fast mode is unavailable in the current auth/environment, Claude reports it through the run result or stderr.

### Mode in notifications
- Launch and completion notifications always include `Mode: standard` or `Mode: fast`.
- Launch/startup output includes `Auth: subscription/OAuth (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY stripped)`.
- `Model: <name>` is appended on completion only when Claude reports a resolved model via the stream-json `init`/`result` event. The wrapper never claims a model it didn't pass.

### Completion Notifications — Estimated Cost
Completion notifications include an estimated cost summary:
- `Est. cost: subscription` — standard Claude Code task path; API-key billing is stripped from the child env
- `Est. cost: ~$X.XXXX est.` — Fast mode or another explicitly token-billed path returned `total_cost_usd`; Fast mode spends extra usage even though auth is subscription/OAuth
- `Est. cost: fast extra usage (cost unavailable)` — Fast mode ran but Claude did not return a dollar estimate
- `in:NNK out:NNK` — input/output token counts
- `cache↩:NNK` — cache-read tokens (if any)
- `cache↑:NNK` — cache-creation tokens (if any)
- `turns:N` — number of conversation turns

Dollar figures are estimates from Claude's own output, not invoiced amounts.

## Claude Code Flags

- `-p "task"` — print mode (non-interactive, outputs result)
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` — no confirmation prompts
- `--verbose --output-format stream-json` — real-time activity tracking for heartbeats
- Fast mode — requested only when the wrapper is invoked with `--fast`; use native `claude -p --fast` when supported, otherwise use `fastMode:true` settings under OAuth/subscription auth

### Why NOT exec/pty?
- `exec` has 2 min default timeout → kills long tasks
- Even with `pty:true`, output has escape codes, hard to parse
- `nohup` + `-p` mode: clean, detached, reliable

### Git requirement
Claude Code needs a git repo. `run-task.py` auto-inits if missing.

## Python/runtime compatibility

`run-task.py` should stay runnable on plain system Python and must not rely on ambient third-party packages for core transport.

Current compatibility rules:
- use `Optional[X]` from `typing` (not `X | None`) so the script remains compatible with Python 3.9+
- do not require `requests` for startup, routing validation, gateway tool calls, or Telegram Bot API calls
- prefer stdlib transport for orchestration-critical paths so OpenClaw/runtime updates do not break the wrapper before launch

```python
# Correct (3.9+)
from typing import Optional
def foo(x: Optional[str]) -> Optional[str]: ...

# Would break on 3.9
def foo(x: str | None) -> str | None: ...
```

Practical lesson from 2026-04-14:
- a runtime update left the wrapper running under Python 3.14 without `requests`
- failure happened at import time (`ModuleNotFoundError`) before `--validate-only` could even test routing
- system wrappers should fail on real orchestration problems, not on optional packaging drift

## Full E2E Test (reference)

Use this when you need to validate the **entire pipeline** in one run:
- launch notification in source thread
- heartbeat after >60s
- Claude mid-task progress update (📡 🟢 CC)
- final result in source thread
- agent wake attempt with summary step

### Pass criteria
1. Launch message appears in the same thread (with expandable prompt quote)
2. At least one wrapper heartbeat appears after ~60s
3. At least one mid-task CC update appears (via `/tmp/cc-notify-<pid>.py`)
4. Final result appears in the same thread (expandable result quote)
5. Agent wake continuation is delivered (`openclaw agent --session-id ... --deliver`) and appears visibly in chat

### Interactive test rule (time budget)
For routine interactive testing, prefer keeping the continuation chain short when that still validates the behavior you care about.
- Phase 1 may intentionally leave a visible gap
- Follow-up iterations should close the gap efficiently
- But the general production rule still applies: if the real goal is not complete and there is no blocker, continue relaunching until it is complete

Reason: routine regression runs should stay reasonably fast, but production behavior should not stop early just because an intermediate iteration was incomplete.

### Visibility rule (mandatory)
Between `✅ Claude Code completed` and any next `🚀 Claude Code started`, there must be a user-facing analysis message in the thread.
- The agent must first post: what was done, what gaps remain, and the decision to continue/stop.
- Only after that message may it launch the next iteration.
- No silent jump from completion directly to next start.

### Canonical full test prompt pattern
- keep prompt **compact** (about 10 lines) for routine testing
- ensure prompt length is **>4500 chars** to verify quote truncation/collapse behavior in Telegram
- force runtime >60s (`sleep 70`) to trigger wrapper heartbeat
- explicitly instruct Claude to call the notify script at least twice
- include a short structured report so output is easy to verify
- the >4500-char filler can be useful work (not just junk): use it for any creative/output-generating task the agent genuinely wants to do in that moment, as long as it remains safe and relevant to the test context

## Long-running task guidance

If a Claude Code task is expected to run longer than ~1 minute, explicitly ask Claude to send intermediate progress updates during execution.

Recommended wording to include in prompt:
- "Send a progress update when you start"
- "Send another update after major milestone(s)"
- "If task exceeds 60 seconds, send at least one heartbeat-style update"

The wrapper also injects a mandatory wait-notice rule into every task with a notify script: before Claude starts any deliberate wait/sleep/backoff/rate-limit pause longer than 60 seconds, it must send a progress notification saying how long it is about to wait and why, then send another notification when the wait is over. This prevents long rate-limit sleeps from looking like a hung run.

For Telegram and WhatsApp runs, updates should use the injected automation script (`/tmp/cc-notify-<pid>.py`).

### Canonical launch (minimal mode)
```bash
cat > /tmp/cc-full-test-prompt.txt << 'EOF'
# ~10 lines, but total >4500 chars:
# 1) notify script now
# 2) create test file with repeated text (to exceed 4500 chars)
# 3) sleep 70 + notify script again
# 4) run several shell commands
# 5) return short structured report
EOF

### Telegram Threaded Mode: Mid-task updates from Claude Code

run-task.py automatically creates an on-disk notification script before launching Claude Code, so CC can send progress updates without seeing the bot token in the prompt (which triggers safety refusals):

```bash
# Just write a normal task prompt — run-task.py handles the rest
cat > /tmp/cc-prompt.txt << 'EOF'
STEP 1: Write analysis to /tmp/report.txt (600+ words)...

After step 1, send a progress notification using the script from the
automation context above: python3 /tmp/cc-notify-<PID>.py "Step 1 done."

STEP 2: Write summary to /tmp/summary.txt...
EOF

nohup python3 {baseDir}/run-task.py \
  --task "$(cat /tmp/cc-prompt.txt)" \
  --project ~/projects/my-project \
  --session "agent:main:main:thread:<THREAD_ID>" \
  --timeout 1800 \
  > /tmp/cc-run.log 2>&1 &
# run-task.py writes /tmp/cc-notify-{pid}.py before launch
# Prepends "[Automation context: use python3 /tmp/cc-notify-{pid}.py 'msg']" to task
# Claude Code calls the file; prefix "📡 🟢 CC: " auto-added; file cleaned up on exit
```

> ⚠️ **Never embed bot tokens or curl commands in the task prompt** — Claude Code correctly identifies hardcoded tokens + external API calls as prompt injection and refuses. Use the on-disk script pattern above instead.

> **Quick reference: launching from a Telegram DM thread (minimal mode)**

> - Required: `--task`, `--project`, `--session`
- Safety: Telegram launches without `:thread:<id>` are blocked by default (`❌ Unsafe routing blocked`)
- For non-thread Telegram deployments, use `--telegram-routing-mode allow-non-thread`.
> - `THREAD_ID` is auto-extracted from session key
> - Target + session UUID are auto-resolved (API, then local session-file fallback)
> - If routing is inconsistent/unresolved, script exits with `❌ Invalid routing` before run
> - All notifications from run-task (launch/heartbeat/result) stay on the source thread ✅

### Long task with extended timeout
```bash
nohup python3 {baseDir}/run-task.py \
  -t "Refactor the entire auth module to use JWT tokens" \
  -p ~/projects/backend \
  -s "agent:main:whatsapp:group:120363425246977860@g.us" \
  --timeout 3600 \
  > /tmp/cc-run.log 2>&1 &
```

## Cost

- Claude Code runs on Max subscription ($200/mo) — NOT API tokens
- Zero OpenClaw API cost while Claude Code works
- Only cost: message delivery + brief agent turn for summary
- Completion notifications show `Est. cost: subscription` for standard stripped-env Claude Code tasks; Fast mode shows dollar estimates from `total_cost_usd` because it consumes paid extra usage.

## Session Resumption

Claude Code sessions can be resumed to continue previous conversations. This is useful for:
- Follow-up tasks building on previous research
- Continuing after timeouts or interruptions
- Multi-step workflows where context matters

### ⚠️ Resume ID — Critical Rule
`--resume` takes the **Claude Code session ID**, not the `run_id` or `wake_id`.

Correct source — look for this line in the run log:
```
📝 Session registered: <session-id-here>
```
That is the value to pass as `--resume <session-id>`.

**Do NOT use:**
- `run_id` from wake payload
- `wake_id` from wake payload
- session IDs from previous unrelated runs

When in doubt: skip `--resume` and start fresh.

### How to Resume

When a task completes, the session ID is automatically captured and saved to the registry (`~/.openclaw/claude_sessions.json`).

For resumed runs, keep the new prompt **short**. Prior Claude session history is already available through `--resume`; re-sending a long orchestration/continuity prompt can trigger `Prompt is too long` before useful work starts.

To resume a session, use the `--resume` flag:

```bash
nohup python3 {baseDir}/run-task.py \
  --task "$(cat /tmp/cc-prompt.txt)" \
  --project ~/projects/my-project \
  --session "SESSION_KEY" \
  --resume <session-id> \
  > /tmp/cc-run.log 2>&1 &
```

### Session Labels

Use `--session-label` to give sessions human-readable names for easier tracking:

```bash
nohup python3 {baseDir}/run-task.py \
  --task "$(cat /tmp/cc-prompt.txt)" \
  --project ~/projects/my-project \
  --session "SESSION_KEY" \
  --session-label "Research on Jackson Berler" \
  > /tmp/cc-run.log 2>&1 &
```

### Listing Recent Sessions

The agent can read the session registry to find recent sessions:

```python
# Python code (for agent automation)
from session_registry import list_recent_sessions, find_session_by_label

# List sessions from last 72 hours
recent = list_recent_sessions(hours=72)
for session in recent:
    print(f"{session['session_id']}: {session['label']} ({session['status']})")

# Find session by label (fuzzy match)
session = find_session_by_label("Jackson")
if session:
    print(f"Found: {session['session_id']}")
```

Or manually inspect the registry:

```bash
cat ~/.openclaw/claude_sessions.json
```

### When to Resume vs Start Fresh

**Resume when:**
- You need context from previous conversation
- Building on previous research/analysis
- Continuing interrupted work
- Following up with clarifications or next steps

**Start fresh when:**
- Completely unrelated task
- Previous session was exploratory/experimental
- You want a clean slate
- Previous session context might cause confusion

### Resume Failure Handling

If a session ID is invalid or expired:
- Error message sent to channel with suggestion to start fresh
- Process exits cleanly (no partial work)
- Check stderr in `/tmp/cc-run.log` for details

Common resume failures:
- Session expired (Claude Code has retention limits)
- Invalid session ID (typo, wrong format)
- Session from different project/context

### Example Workflow

**Step 1: Initial research**
```bash
# Save prompt
write /tmp/research-prompt.txt with "Research the codebase architecture for project X"

# Launch task (Telegram thread-safe example)
nohup python3 {baseDir}/run-task.py \
  --task "$(cat /tmp/research-prompt.txt)" \
  --project ~/projects/project-x \
  --session "agent:main:main:thread:<THREAD_ID>" \
  --session-label "Project X architecture research" \
  > /tmp/cc-run.log 2>&1 &
```

**Step 2: Check result and find session ID**
```bash
# Session ID printed in stderr: "📝 Session registered: <id>"
tail /tmp/cc-run.log

# Or read from registry
cat ~/.openclaw/claude_sessions.json | grep "Project X"
```

**Step 3: Follow-up implementation**
```bash
# Save follow-up prompt
write /tmp/implement-prompt.txt with "Based on your research, implement the authentication module"

# Resume session
nohup python3 {baseDir}/run-task.py \
  --task "$(cat /tmp/implement-prompt.txt)" \
  --project ~/projects/project-x \
  --session "SESSION_KEY" \
  --resume <session-id-from-step-1> \
  --session-label "Project X auth implementation" \
  > /tmp/cc-run2.log 2>&1 &
```

## Wake Troubleshooting

When the agent wake / continue chain fails (no agent summary, wrong thread, session not resolved,
iterative loop stalls, etc.), see the dedicated guide:

→ **[WAKE-TROUBLESHOOTING.md](WAKE-TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**

Includes a **Quick Triage Checklist (60 seconds)** plus detailed items: agent not waking,
double messages, wrong thread routing, UUID resolution failures, session-locked wake,
`❌ Invalid routing`, Telegram HTTP 400 silent drops, mid-task update failures, stale/duplicate wake skips, and more.

## Current Stable Behavior (2026-04-24)

This is the version validated in live Telegram thread tests.

- **Two execution modes only:** `standard` (no model flag, claude picks its default model) and `fast` (true Fast mode via native `--fast` when available, otherwise `fastMode:true` settings under OAuth/subscription auth).
- **Billing guard:** every Claude Code child process is launched with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` stripped. The wrapper must not accidentally burn API credits.
- **Mode in notifications:** launch and completion notifications always show `Mode: standard` or `Mode: fast`. The model name is appended on completion only when Claude reports it via the `init`/`result` stream-json event — the wrapper never claims a pinned model it didn't pass.
- **Estimated cost in completion notifications:** standard stripped-env Claude Code task runs show `Est. cost: subscription`; Fast mode shows dollar estimates from `total_cost_usd` because it consumes paid extra usage.
- Wake continuity: Telegram wake is delivered (`openclaw agent --deliver`) so continuation turns are visible in chat.
- No silent launch policy: agent must post a visible decision turn before launching next iteration.
- Deterministic wake guard: duplicate/stale wake dispatch is skipped by per-project state + `wake_id`/output dedupe.
- Trace mode: `--trace-live` emits technical milestones (`RUN_TASK START/COMPLETE`, `WAKE`, `WAKE SKIP`) into the same thread.
- Resume safety: `--resume` must use the Claude session id from `📝 Session registered: ...` in the run log.
- Compact heartbeat now includes active subagents count as `sub:<N>` (example: `🟢 CC (3min) | sub:1 | 12K tok | 18 calls | 🔧 Bash`).
- `output_tokens` is aggregated from all assistant stream messages (main agent + subagents).
- `last_activity` / last tool signal is unified: whichever actor (main or subagent) emitted the latest tool event is shown.
- Active subagents are tracked via Task/Agent lifecycle in stream-json (`tool_use id` add, matching `tool_result`/`task_notification` remove).
