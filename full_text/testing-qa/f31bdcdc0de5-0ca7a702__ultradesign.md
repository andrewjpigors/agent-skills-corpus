Give the user the working interface they asked for. Do not expose internal quotas or ask
them to operate the harness. Run host-native agents in fresh contexts; do not create a
workflow engine, queue, model router, or session runtime.

Read `protocol/human-design-loop.md` from `omd pack dir` first. It owns phase order, state,
evidence precedence, blindness, isolation, checkpoints, and probe safety. Use the relevant
theory/cookbook files (`theory/`, `composition/`, `graphics/`, `motion/`, `craft/`) instead
of duplicating their rules here. `.omd/` records are English; the interface and handback use
the user's language.

## 0. Preflight and routing

Run `omd doctor`. Stop on a failed prerequisite. Pin the absolute working directory first. A Figma
frame or exact visual target uses the single Figma structural-bypass route declared above; it retains
content, craft, glance, probe, critique, and all UX evidence rather than handing the run off or
terminating this loop.

Apply stack precedence exactly: explicit user request > existing repository stack/toolchain
(including existing vanilla HTML) > React + Vite + TypeScript only for a truly blank
greenfield. Plain HTML greenfield requires an explicit user request; there is no autonomous
single-static-surface exception. Preserve and investigate unrecognised package/toolchain
evidence instead of replacing it with React. Greenfield scaffold dependencies are allowed;
existing projects receive no unnecessary dependencies.
Plain HTML/CSS/JS for a blank greenfield requires the explicit user request quoted verbatim in the
stack `omd decision`. Absent a matching verbatim user quote, a truly blank greenfield is React +
Vite + TypeScript — never infer, assume, or paraphrase a pre-authorization. A decision that claims
the brief "pre-authorized plain HTML" without a verbatim user quote that actually says so is a
stack-routing defect, not a lawful shortcut.
"Existing repository stack" means a real project the user brought: a package manifest, a framework
or build config (`vite.config`, `next.config`, `package.json`, etc.), or files the user explicitly
points at. A bare `index.html`/`.css`/`.js` with no manifest and no build config, sitting next to an
`.omd/` directory from a prior OMD run, is OMD's own leftover output — not a user stack. A fresh
design brief in that folder is a greenfield (React + Vite + TypeScript by default), not a
continuation of the leftover HTML; do not let your own previous output pin the stack to vanilla.
Testing repeatedly in one directory reuses the `.omd/refs/` board (fine, output-neutral) but never
reclassifies a greenfield as an existing HTML project.
The hand runs `omd stack` before its first production write and builds in exactly the stack it
computes from folder evidence — a blank greenfield resolves to React + Vite + TypeScript
deterministically, so the model never talks itself into plain HTML for a one-page site. The only
lawful override is a verbatim explicit user request for HTML.

Run `omd config show`. `checkpoint: none` is the default and means no approval waits.
Only `concept`, `structure`, or `both` opt into a human pause at that named point.
Speed comes only from output-neutral structure, never from degrading the result. Two levers, both
of which leave the full-fidelity output unchanged: reuse a coverage-complete `.omd/refs/` board when
this working directory already has one for the concept (scout only the missing categories rather
than rebuilding it), and let the scout capture references in parallel with `omd ref add-batch` — one
browser instead of one per reference. The first run in a fresh directory is the slowest because it
builds the board; later runs in the same directory are much faster and still full-fidelity. There is
no reduced-quality mode: every run is the real result.

Run `omd taste profile` and pass only that explicit-user profile to the framer. Never use
`--all` for design decisions. Current brief beats current explicit feedback, which beats
prior explicit taste, which beats agent choices. Record conflicts.

## 1. Frame and concept hypothesis

Spawn `oh-my-design:framer` with the brief, explicit-user taste profile, and working directory. It
records the primary task, frequent action, costliest error/recovery, the surface
classification (`marketing` | `product` | `editorial` | `mixed`, per `theory/ux.md`
§Surface types), evidence, hypothesis, and trade in `.omd/frame.md`. The surface
classification routes every later stage's grammar: pass it explicitly to the composer,
sketches, hand, and eyes. A brief that asks for a tool (dashboard, console, CRUD/admin,
editor, settings, onboarding, search) is a `product` surface even when phrased like a
site request — do not let the marketing grammar be the silent default.

Read the frame and relevant theory. Explore several distinct candidate concept directions, not a
single guess — each a named generator/metaphor, colour direction, typography register,
surface/material stance, density posture, quiet/confident/showpiece register, and one memorable
moment. Ground them in the brief and evidence, and after the scout's design-gallery visual research
(§2, per `protocol/human-design-loop.md` §Visual reference gallery and concept exploration)
blind-select the strongest main-screen direction and record it — with its rejected alternatives —
using `omd frame generator` plus `omd decision`. The number of directions scales with ambition and
uncertainty. This visual-direction choice is a direction signal only and never replaces the
structural sketch divergence or any UX, copy, type, or critique gate; a generic default visual
system (unstyled controls, flat fields, weak hierarchy, arbitrary whitespace, no distinctive
surface/colour system) fails the visual acceptance gate even when every task passes. Pause only when
config explicitly includes the concept checkpoint.
When the brief explicitly signals visual ambition — 개쩔게, 죽여주게, 미쳤다, 어워드/awards-level,
killer, wow, showpiece — treat it as an explicit user request for the showpiece register and at
least one genuinely novel signature moment, and record it as such. Do not reframe an explicit
ambition brief down into restraint: substance-over-spectacle is the default only when the brief is
silent on ambition; the current brief beats the agent's own taste for restraint. Restraint still
governs *how many* techniques ship (one signature moment, never a catalogue), never *whether* the
explicitly requested showpiece ambition is honored at all.

## 2. Research and copy before structure

Spawn `oh-my-design:scout` with the concept, explicit functions or product goal, surface classification,
user references first, and working directory; also pass the component inventory. Require the canonical branch decision before research.
`protocol/composition-contract.md` exclusively
  owns the strict `## Reference synthesis` Markdown ABI; require scout to emit sanitized records
  that use its exact axis keys, dispositions, reasons, and selector rules without a role-local
  schema. Scout preserves explicit user-reference coverage, stable source keys/labels, trust,
  uncertainty, and only applicable axes; it never passes raw source material downstream. Treat
  the scout return as a sanitized summary, never raw transcripts or screenshots. Downstream
  receives sanitized criteria, never raw URLs, screenshots, pixels, or source-page descriptions.
  Resolve conflicts through product task, accessibility/mobile constraints, and one coherent
  design system.
  Require the scout to cover curated design-gallery visual references (Pinterest, Dribbble, Mobbin,
  Behance, Land-book, and equivalents) as a first-class category per
  `protocol/human-design-loop.md` §Visual reference gallery and concept exploration, sanitized into
  the canonical multi-axis synthesis; no gallery image, URL, or pixel travels downstream.
  **List-detail branch:** only for a requested or task-completely inferred list→detail workspace,
  apply the canonical non-primary work-object selection requirement in
  `protocol/human-design-loop.md`; it never creates a default task for other surfaces.
  **Support-chat branch:** only for an explicitly requested or task-completely inferred
  support-ticket conversation, apply the canonical temporal-window merge/split and visible-last-bubble
  regressions in `protocol/human-design-loop.md`; it never applies conversation behavior elsewhere.


The coordinator does not author copy. The scout's voice/audience evidence is the writer's only dependency;
remaining board capture is independent. Once that evidence is in hand, spawn
`oh-my-design:writer` concurrently with the scout's remaining board capture — the writer drafts the copy deck
while the board finishes building. Give it the brief, that cited voice/audience evidence, working
directory, `protocol/copy-deck.md`, and `theory/voice.md`.
It writes only `.omd/copy-deck.md`. Run `omd copy --check`; on failure stop divergence and
send the deterministic findings back to the writer for autonomous repair without waiting
for the user.
The writer additionally runs `omd text-slop .omd/copy-deck.md` as an advisory self-scan; it is
non-gating and never replaces the blind copy review, but a kept candidate carries a recorded reason.

After the first clean check, spawn a fresh `oh-my-design:eye` in copy-editor mode with only the
sanitized brief, copy deck/fact ledger, and cited voice/audience evidence. Do not pass renders,
layout, code, build rationale, frame, decisions, or authorship. Before sending its findings
to the writer, preserve and validate the report as specified below. Then send the cleanly
preserved findings to the writer for deck-first revision, rerun `omd copy --check`, and start
sketches only after it passes again. Every shipped claim traces to a verified fact ID;
fixture/open facts never ship. Status/error/empty/recovery copy exists only where applicable.

Before returning the report to the writer, preserve the fresh eye's report verbatim at
`.omd/.cache/copy-eye.md`. The exact copy-eye report format is owned only by
`protocol/human-design-loop.md`; do not restate or alter it. Compute the
reviewed hash before writer revision, then immediately run `omd copy --review-check`. A failure
stops writer revision and divergence until the report format is repaired. The command validates
report structure only; it does not prove blindness or semantic quality and must not compare the
reviewed hash with the current deck. The writer's changed deck and final `omd copy --check` are
separate evidence; never overwrite the report with the final deck hash or claim that the eye
reviewed the revised bytes.

For a `product` or `mixed` surface, and for any multi-surface output, run `omd design`
and complete the durable design contract — its Information architecture and Interaction
states sections are the state discipline (loading, empty, error, success, disabled,
offline: implemented or explicitly skipped with a reason) that keeps a work surface from
shipping happy-path-only. Only a single-surface `marketing`/`editorial` run may skip this
artifact with a recorded reason; that skip never changes stack routing.
For every `product` surface and product screen of a `mixed` surface, the first viewport is owned by the work object at representative working density; never replace it with a marketing hero or decoration.
  For `product` or `mixed` surfaces, the frame owns the `Task coverage matrix` and the composer
  maps every applicable frame `T#` into `UX task coverage` using the canonical schema in
  `protocol/human-design-loop.md`; do not restate or alter that protocol-owned schema.
  The same protocol exclusively owns task-evidence fields, cardinality, cache locations,
  applicability, and validation. The hand binds each existing production-reachable task
  to its production locator and work-object identity, runs declared applicable probes and
  required-viewport renders, then publishes actual evidence with `omd evidence tasks --input
  .omd/.cache/task-evidence-manifest.json` followed by `omd evidence tasks-check --json`.
  Invalid submit remains attemptable and proves an actionable error with the entered value
  preserved; transient evidence is captured only after settlement or reduced motion. Never
  create task rows because a state is reachable or hand-write `.omd/task-evidence.json`. Do not
  invent product task/state/probe evidence or a task-evidence manifest for `marketing`,
  `editorial`, or `static` runs.


## 3. Typography proof before structure

After the second clean copy check, spawn `oh-my-design:typesetter` with the copy deck, scout's cited
typography evidence, `protocol/human-design-loop.md`, and `theory/typography.md`. It creates
layout-neutral actual-copy specimens in `.omd/.cache/type-proof/`, renders 1280x900 and
390x844, and writes `.omd/type-proof.md`. It does not design composition, colour, graphics,
or motion and does not rewrite copy.

Spawn a fresh `oh-my-design:eye` in typography-proof mode with only the two specimens plus sanitized
copy and requirements. Do not pass authorship, reference rationale, page structure, colour,
or code. Return the blind findings to the typesetter, require revision and both renders
again, and start sketches only after the proof passes. Large type may pass when concept-
bearing and proof-clean; size alone is neither success nor failure.

The proof fingerprint is invalid after any copy, font family/file, requested weight/axis, or
proof container-width change. Rerun the proof instead of carrying an obsolete approval.

## 4. Composition contract before divergence

  Spawn a fresh `oh-my-design:composer` with only the sanitized frame/concept (including surface
  classification), clean copy deck, approved type proof, scout transfer records,
  `protocol/composition-contract.md`, and `theory/layout.md`. The composition protocol alone
  owns the strict `## Reference synthesis` Markdown ABI: the composer serializes the scout's
  sanitized records exactly in that section, with no duplicate schema, heading, axis, or selector.
  It applies the canonical Branch A/B and clean-room rules in `protocol/human-design-loop.md`
  without creating task rows. The composer writes only `.omd/composition.md`, records required
  fingerprints, and runs `omd composition --check`; validator failure, including missing or
  duplicate canonical axes or selectors, stops divergence. When no durable scout summary exists,
  it records `N/A — reason` rather than inventing evidence.


Require one first-viewport dominant anchor, its visual-mass budget and relationship to
value/proof/visible CTA, plus a visible rejection condition. A visible CTA and predictable
completion path satisfy task reach; the terminal form/control surface need not be above fold
and is not rewarded merely for appearing there. The anchor may use lawful product/evidence
media, explanatory graphics, real interaction/data, or concept-bearing typography—never a
mandatory photo or invented fact/asset. When mechanism/material/workflow is central, Media
roles assigns a lawful carrier or an explicit alternate non-media mental-model carrier with
its limitation; `none because no approved photo` is insufficient.
For a confident/showpiece register where the composition is the deliverable, the composer
specifies 2–3 independent clean-room art-direction directions from the committed
palette/type/material, sanitized measured principles, and skin-abstracted blueprints. The
host/coordinator owns concurrent draft generation, cache management, blind selection, and
provenance/decision recording. The composer may consume only a host/coordinator-produced draft
whose lineage attests that it used only those sanitized inputs and no source screenshot, URL,
pixels, or visual likeness. The composer does not generate drafts, inspect raw source material,
manage the cache, select a draft, or record that decision. Drafts are design references, never shipped
page assets; `omd ref distance` still gates the shipped build. A quiet register or unavailable
host image capability uses the reference board and CSS/SVG graphics recipes instead.

Run `omd composition --check`. Missing sections, malformed fingerprints, or stale inputs
stop divergence and return to the composer. A later change to frame, copy, type proof, or
scout summary invalidates all dependent sketches and the production build until the contract
is recomposed and passes again.
The composer also runs `omd visual-richness .omd/composition.md` as an advisory carrier read;
`CARRIER-ADVISORY` findings are non-gating prompts to name a purposeful carrier for a content
section, and a `quiet` register legitimately yields none.

## 5. Independent structural divergence and blind selection

Gate divergence by structural uncertainty and impact:

- default: two independent `oh-my-design:sketch` contexts;
- showpiece or high uncertainty/impact: three;
- skip only when structure is supplied (Figma/target/explicit layout), recording why.

On the normal graph, skipping the composer or sketch divergence is a protocol violation: an
`.omd/composition.md` that passes `omd composition --check` and the blind sketch-selection record are
mandatory ship evidence. The Figma structural-bypass route is the sole exception and records its
explicitly retained/skipped phases; do not run a terminal handoff or a second competing graph.

Give every sketch the same sanitized frame/concept, copy deck, sanitized approved typography
contract, and sanitized composition contract, plus a different anonymous candidate id and
one axis from the contract's Candidate axes section. Include approved dependencies, grid and
alignment behavior, density, focal hierarchy, form grammar, media or approved alternate
mental-model carrier, responsive recomposition, type
roles, family, weight, size/measure, and wrapping constraints; omit source rationale,
rejected alternatives, URLs, and authorship. Sketches preserve both contracts and vary only
their assigned axis. They cannot invent a new type scale, see one another, or read the full
proof, and write only under
`.omd/.cache/sketches/<id>/`. Their real-content low-fi renders contain structure, type
scale, and enough grayscale carrier structure to judge its functional relation—never colour,
motion, polished/decorative graphics, production edits, or sales prose.

Every candidate renders exactly four proofs: fixed desktop 1280x900, fixed mobile 390x844,
full-page desktop continuity, and full-page mobile continuity. Full-page captures use
`--full-page` and are supplemental evidence for narrative dependency and composition rhythm
only; fixed renders remain authoritative for every acceptance dimension.

Spawn a fresh `oh-my-design:eye` in sketch-selector mode with anonymous renders, sanitized frame,
copy deck, and the same sanitized typography and composition contracts only. Score exactly:
task/CTA clarity, narrative dependency, composition rhythm, concept-specific form,
responsive hierarchy, type/copy accommodation, interaction/form usability risk, and
accessibility/implementation cost. Do not substitute a generic visual-taste score or expose
candidate, source, typography, or composition rationale.
Use the frozen scale exactly: 0 absent/broken; 1 weak with major failures dominant; 2
adequate and functional with generic or consequential weakness; 3 strong, deliberate, and
robust with only minor weakness; 4 exceptional, unusually coherent/specific with no material
desktop/mobile contradiction. Require eight integer scores, eight one-sentence visible-
evidence rationales, and the arithmetic mean. Reject any contract violation or any dimension
below 2; do not average away a floor failure. Do not equate a form above fold with CTA reach,
and award concept-specific form only when the motif/anchor/carrier has a functional relation
to the domain mechanism, material, workflow, evidence, or action.

Use these frozen dimension-specific anchors. Scores 1 and 3 interpolate only between adjacent
0/2/4 anchors; they are not generic visual-taste scores:

- **Task/CTA clarity** — 0: no immediate primary CTA or completion path; entry or next action
  is ambiguous or blocked. 2: the CTA is visible and usable with an understandable next step,
  but feedback or the path is generic or weak. 4: an immediate primary CTA, predictable
  completion path, and state feedback are unmistakable on desktop and mobile; a terminal form
  is not required above the fold.
- **Narrative dependency** — 0: sections are interchangeable or out of order, or prerequisite
  information is missing or follows the decision that needs it. 2: the sequence is
  understandable, but some sections remain weakly dependent or generic. 4: every section
  answers an entering question and creates a prerequisite for the next; removal or reordering
  visibly weakens the narrative.
- **Composition rhythm** — 0: alignment, visual mass, negative space, span, and density are
  arbitrary or monotonous and obscure hierarchy or sequence. 2: those five properties form a
  workable hierarchy with generic or uneven transitions. 4: alignment, visual mass, negative
  space, span, and density vary deliberately to stage the sequence and dominant anchor across
  desktop and mobile, without an arbitrary break.
- **Concept-specific form** — 0: the result is a generic template or its motif/carrier is
  decorative and unrelated to the domain. 2: a domain relationship is recognizable, but some
  anatomy remains generic or ornamental. 4: motif, anchor, and carrier arise from the domain
  mechanism, material, workflow, evidence, or action and govern functional relationships
  rather than decoration.
- **Responsive hierarchy** — 0: mobile is a shrunken/stacked desktop with lost or cropped
  content, a broken task path, or a broken anchor dependency. 2: usable reflow preserves
  content and task reach, but priority or anchor recomposition is conventional or uneven.
  4: deliberate mobile recomposition preserves semantic order, dominant-anchor morphology,
  priority, and an uninterrupted CTA/task path with no desktop-only dependency.
- **Type/copy accommodation** — 0: real copy truncates, overlaps, becomes placeholder content,
  or breaks Korean wrapping, hierarchy, or CTA labels. 2: real copy fits and hierarchy remains
  understandable, with minor awkward wraps, repetition, or density. 4: real Korean copy,
  repeated data, and CTA labels are fully integrated; measure, wrapping, hierarchy, and
  concept-bearing type remain robust on desktop and mobile.
- **Interaction/form usability risk** — 0: the primary task cannot succeed, or controls,
  focus path, feedback, error/recovery, or a required reachable state is broken. 2: the primary
  task works with adequate controls and states, but feedback, recovery, or an edge state has a
  consequential non-blocking weakness. 4: task success, immediate feedback, focus path,
  duplicate prevention, value preservation, and every applicable recovery/exit are robust in
  supplied probes; inapplicable states are not invented.
- **Accessibility/implementation cost** — 0: contrast, focus/order, reflow, or target reach
  fails, or the structure is impractical and visibly unfinished. 2: the implementation path is
  credible and basic access works, but costly complexity or incomplete finish remains. 4:
  contrast, keyboard focus/order, reflow, target reach, reduced motion, maintainable structure,
  and applicable finish details form a credible, accessible, finished implementation.

When every candidate violates a contract or has any dimension below 2, record **no winner**.
Never lower the floor, select the closest candidate, or hide the failure in the mean. Have the
fresh selector classify the shared failure from visible evidence only as contract-level when
a supplied contract requirement creates the shared contradiction, or execution-level when
the contracts permit success but candidates fail to execute it.

Run at most one bounded recovery round. For a contract-level failure, spawn a fresh composer
with only the sanitized shared visible contract conflict—no candidate renders, scores,
identities, or rationale. Require a revised `.omd/composition.md`, a clean
`omd composition --check`, and a new hash; invalidate every old candidate. Then spawn fresh
sketch contexts for replacements under the revised contract and assigned axes. For an
execution-level failure, preserve the approved contracts and run exactly one bounded
replacement round in fresh sketch contexts, one per candidate. Each replacement receives
the same approved contracts and axis plus
only its own sanitized visible failure and acceptance criteria. Do not pass numeric scores,
the prior render/source, other candidates/renders, or candidate/selector rationale.

Spawn a fresh selector for the replacement set. If none passes, do not retry again: reframe
and stop with visible evidence, or pause only when the configured structure checkpoint
requires a human decision. Never create an execution engine or unbounded retry loop. Record
the winner and rejected tradeoffs only when a candidate actually passes.

## 6. Production build with reflective craft

On the normal graph, spawn `oh-my-design:hand` once with the selected structure, sanitized build brief,
copy deck, `.omd/type-proof.md`, `.omd/composition.md`, and accepted sanitized transfer criteria;
require `omd composition --check` before its first production write. On the Figma structural-bypass
route, supply `.omd/figma/snapshot.json`, `.omd/figma/design-system.md`, `.omd/attribution.md`, and
the selected frame inventory instead of composition/transfer inputs; require those artifacts to exist
and match the supplied frame before the first production write. The hand implements normal-graph
criteria at their destination screen/route and unique semantic reference-landing selector, or records
an evidence-backed deviation; it never receives raw URLs, screenshots, pixels, or source descriptions.
Transfer records never create tasks or probes. The hand builds semantic
real-content layout first,
then the visual system, then motion. It must record two concrete reflection-in-action loops:

```bash
omd craft checkpoint semantic --render <path> --observed "..." --changed "..."
omd craft checkpoint visual --render <path> --observed "..." --changed "..."
```

The semantic checkpoint occurs after desktop/mobile real-content layout. Then the hand
re-proves typography inside the selected production container at desktop and mobile after
OMD render/IR waits for `document.fonts.ready`. It compares requested versus computed
family/weight, actual Korean/Latin/numerals, wraps, clips, orphans, and hierarchy. The visual
checkpoint occurs only after that reproof and after type/colour/spacing/components, before
motion. Both checkpoints require a change; a gray-box or "no change" ritual does not count.
  Immediately after scaffold/dependency resolution, resolve every newly introduced import/export
  against the exact installed versions, parse generated configuration with its owning tool, and run
  focused typecheck, build, and test-discovery. Repeat this smoke verification after every
  dependency, dependency API, or build-config change; retain the full final verification. For
  dialogs, toasts, and other transient UI, collect evidence only after fonts and
  animations/transitions settle, or under reduced motion, and require visible pixels rather than
  DOM presence alone.

The build acceptance contract verifies the primary task, most frequent action,
costliest-error recovery, an exit from every reachable state, immediate visible feedback,
and mobile reach. It also verifies the focal anchor's morphology, visual-mass budget, and
value/proof/CTA relationship plus the lawful media/alternate carrier's functional relation
and limitation in fixed desktop/mobile renders. It records visible acceptance evidence or a
deviation for the sharp eye. A full form need not occupy the first viewport. The hand uses native semantics, preserves form values on error, blocks
duplicate submits, implements only applicable states, and honors reduced motion.

## 7. Squint before sharp, then safe interaction

Render desktop and mobile squint images before any sharp render is exposed to a critic:

```bash
omd render <page> --viewport 1280x900 --squint -o .omd/.cache/squint-desktop.png
omd render <page> --viewport 390x844 --squint -o .omd/.cache/squint-mobile.png
```

These commands capture the exact viewport by default. `--full-page` is supplementary
continuity evidence only and never replaces fixed-viewport desktop/mobile acceptance renders.

Spawn `oh-my-design:glance` with only those images. Preserve its four-line report. Squint isolates
hierarchy; never call it a colour-blind simulation or literal 50ms test.

Production source now exists. Read `protocol/slop-review.md`, run `omd slop scan <root>
--json`, and keep the raw report under `.omd/.cache/`. Triage each candidate as `confirmed`,
`dismissed`, or `needs-render`; candidate presence is not a failed gate, while an untriaged
candidate is. Treat `needs-render` as transitional: obtain sharp evidence and resolve it
before ship. Final untriaged and needs-render counts are both zero. Record durable
repair/dismissal evidence in `.omd/decisions.md`. Do not merge
source candidates with rendered IR warnings or send them to check history/coach; rendered IR
is authoritative where they overlap.

  Use the copy deck's Interaction scope. `stateful` requires explicit non-destructive
  `.omd/probes/primary.json` and `.omd/probes/recovery.json`, with both run through `omd probe`;
  these are baseline probes, not a ceiling on the `Task coverage matrix`. `navigation-only`
  requires and runs only the primary probe; recovery is N/A with a reason. `static` records
  both probes N/A with reasons. Never invent recovery/error/empty UI or product task/state/probe
  evidence for an inapplicable `marketing`, `editorial`, or `static` surface. Probe only local
  files/localhost, declared click/fill/press actions, declared expectations, and optional
  expected tab order. Never auto-discover and click controls; never probe remote production or
  authenticated flows.

## 8. Blind critique, repair, and reframe

  Now render sharp desktop/mobile (and filmstrip when motion matters), run deterministic checks,
  and spawn a fresh `oh-my-design:eye`. Pass only the sanitized review brief required by
  `protocol/human-design-loop.md`. On the normal graph, include applicable reference-landing criteria
  and the `omd composition --check` result, never source identity or material; the eye treats validator
  failure or missing/duplicate canonical axes or selectors as a blocker and verifies visible/probe-
  supported landed correspondence. On the Figma structural-bypass route, pass the supplied frame
  identity, snapshot/design-system/attribution hashes, and fresh `omd figma diff <frame-id>
  <rendered-page> --json` result instead of composition/reference-synthesis evidence. A validator pass
  never replaces visual/probe review. Reject wrong landings, interaction-only or token-only substitutes,
  or contradictory behavior; UX task performance and visual composition remain co-equal. Route only
  the canonical conditional list-detail non-primary-task and support-ticket temporal-window regressions
  when applicable, with no leakage to other surfaces.
The sharp eye explicitly judges focal hierarchy and the lawful media/alternate mental-model
carrier across desktop/mobile, without demanding a photo, invented asset, or form above fold.

For showpiece only, spawn one additional fresh eye with exactly one dominant-technique lens
chosen from typography, motion, or graphics. It reviews that technique only. Do not create
a permanent specialist or multi-lens panel.

Send prioritized findings back to the hand for the smallest repair, then rerun affected
checks/renders/probe and `omd slop scan`. Confirmed source candidates are repaired; dismissed
ones have evidence; confirmed current candidates are rescanned; final untriaged and
needs-render counts are zero. If rendered evidence changes the problem, run `omd frame reframe --to
... --because ...`; otherwise record why the frame survived.
If a finding requests copy repair, update the deck through oh-my-design:writer first, re-run
`omd copy --check`, and only then update source through the hand. Copy, claim, or action
changes invalidate the affected blind copy review and typography proof. The hand never
silently rewrites shipped copy.

## 9. Ship

Verify project tests/build plus `omd check`, two clean copy checks around an independent
writer/editor pass, a blind typography proof before sketches and production-container
reproof before the visual checkpoint, responsive sharp/squint renders, applicable filmstrip, humanize review,
probe, `omd craft status`, `omd design --check` when applicable, `omd ref distance`, bounded target
convergence when a manifest exists, and `omd check --site` for multi-page output. The normal graph also
requires a fresh `omd composition --check`; the Figma structural-bypass route instead requires the
supplied snapshot/design-system/attribution artifacts plus a fresh passing `omd figma diff` for every
selected frame. Source-candidate triage has no untriaged or needs-render items and its
scan was rerun after repairs. Everything is clean or has an evidence-backed deliberate overrule.
When the run is an iteration with a before/after pair, form the pairwise blind-choose verdict:
blind-choose is the visual distinction signal only; applicable task probes, accessibility checks, and
declared viewport task evidence remain independent passing UX gates. Record the comparison; it never
replaces the blind typography, copy, or critique gates above.

### Refinement rounds (RED/GREEN, evidence-driven)

For a confident/showpiece register — and always when the brief signals awards-level ambition — the
first shippable build is not the ship: it is round 0 of a bounded RED/GREEN loop. First write the
acceptance criteria (the GREEN target) from the frame and `theory/expressive.md` § "Slop-free is not
the same as distinctive": for example, names the template it resembles and departs from it; no two
competing primary masses; one clear first-read; slop scan clean; `omd ref distance` <= 0.6; carrier
present and register-fit; and the blind-choose after beats before. Any unmet criterion is RED.

Then iterate, leaving evidence every round — a round with no evidence does not count:
1. The hand makes one concrete change, then captures sharp desktop/mobile renders into
   `.omd/.cache/rounds/round-<N>/`, measures each visual criterion (glance hierarchy, `omd check`/slop
   scan, `omd ref distance`, carrier read), and reruns every applicable declared task probe,
   accessibility check, and required-viewport task evidence. Any UX invariant failure rolls the round
   back.
   Build and judgment stay separate.
2. Spawn a fresh `oh-my-design:eye` — never the hand that built it — with only the sanitized acceptance
   criteria and the two anonymized renders (this round's after and the previous build). It forms the
   blind-choose visual distinction and reports which criteria are still RED. Record its verdict, the
   still-RED criteria, and the evidence paths with `omd decision`; blind-choose cannot overrule a UX
   invariant.
3. Decide continue or stop from the round evidence. CONTINUE only while the applicable UX invariants
   pass, blind-choose favors the after, RED criteria remain, and the round budget (default 3) is not
   spent — then fix the single highest-leverage RED target with the same one-concrete-change discipline
   as the craft checkpoints and re-measure. STOP on GREEN (every acceptance criterion met — done), a
   UX regression (rollback), a visual regression (revert to the previous build), a plateau
   (blind-choose tie while still RED), or the budget (keep the best valid build and report the
   remaining RED). A round with no evidence does not count.
The loop is bounded and never an automatic retry: it advances only on measured visual improvement
while UX and beautiful UI remain coequal, and converges on GREEN or the budget. A quiet register may
ship after one pass with a recorded reason.
  After all source and approved inputs stop changing, freeze and collect final evidence in the order
  required by `protocol/human-design-loop.md`: run `omd source --seal <root>`, then `omd source
  --check <root>`; build and collect every final check, test, declared/applicable probes,
  fixed-viewport screenshot/render, and applicable motion filmstrip from sealed source; then run
  `omd source --check <root>` again. For `product` or `mixed`, publish the task index with
  `omd evidence tasks --input .omd/.cache/task-evidence-manifest.json`, then `omd evidence
  tasks-check --json`. The protocol exclusively owns final-evidence fields, artifact roles/cardinality,
  cache locations, publication behavior, and stale-bundle handling. The hand writes the required
  manifest input at `.omd/.cache/final-evidence-manifest.json`, runs `omd evidence finalize --input
  .omd/.cache/final-evidence-manifest.json`, then `omd evidence check --json`, and never directly
  writes `.omd/final-evidence.json`. Any source or build mutation requires the protocol's reseal,
  rebuild, rerun, and reindex sequence; the seal proves byte freshness only and does not prove
  semantic copy/source fidelity.
Deliver the working artifact and briefly state the frame,
concept, structural choice, what the two craft renders changed, glance/critique outcome,
and any deliberate overruling. Do not release, deploy, or wait for further approval unless
the user asked for it.
