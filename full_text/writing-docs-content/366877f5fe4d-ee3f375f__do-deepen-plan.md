# Deepen Plan — Context-Lean Edition

## Introduction

**Note: Use the current year** when dating documents and searching for recent documentation.

This command enhances an existing plan with parallel research, skill, and review agents. Unlike the default version, it **persists all agent outputs to disk** to avoid context exhaustion. The parent agent stays lean as a coordinator — it never holds full agent outputs in context.

**All outputs are retained across runs for traceability and learning.** Each run gets its own numbered directory. Prior run data is NEVER deleted.

## Plan File

<plan_path> #$ARGUMENTS </plan_path>

**If the plan path above is empty:**
1. Check for recent plans: `ls -la docs/plans/`
2. Use **AskUserQuestion** to ask which plan to deepen. Do not proceed without a valid path.

## Phase 0: Setup Working Directory

Derive a short stem from the plan filename (e.g., `feat-user-dashboard-redesign` from `YYYY-MM-DD-feat-user-dashboard-redesign-plan.md`).

**Initialize shared values first** (must run before any `$WORKFLOWS_ROOT` reference):

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/init-values.sh deepen-plan <plan-stem>
```

Read the output. Track the values PLUGIN_ROOT, MAIN_ROOT, WORKFLOWS_ROOT, RUN_ID, DATE, STATS_FILE, CACHED_MODEL (and NOTE if emitted) for use in subsequent steps. If init-values.sh fails or any value is empty, warn the user and stop.

**All `.workflows/` paths in this skill use `$WORKFLOWS_ROOT` (the main repo root's `.workflows/` directory), NOT relative `.workflows/`.** This ensures artifacts survive worktree lifecycle transitions and are shared across sessions.

**Determine run number:**

```bash
# Check for existing runs
ls $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/run-*-manifest.json 2>/dev/null
```

If prior runs exist, increment the run number (e.g., if `run-2-manifest.json` exists, this is run 3). If no prior runs exist, this is run 1.

**CRITICAL: NEVER delete prior run directories or files.** All agent outputs, synthesis files, and manifests from prior runs are retained for traceability and learning.

```bash
mkdir -p $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/agents/run-<N>
```

#### Phase 0a: Stats Capture Config Check

Read `compound-workflows.local.md` and check the `stats_capture` key. If `stats_capture` is explicitly set to `false`, skip all stats capture for this run. If missing or any other value, proceed with capture.

If stats capture is enabled, read `$PLUGIN_ROOT/resources/stats-capture-schema.md` for field derivation rules and `capture-stats.sh` usage. Initialize a dispatch counter at 0.

### Stats Capture

If stats_capture ≠ false in compound-workflows.local.md: after each Agent completion, extract `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, and `duration_ms` values from the `<usage>` notification and pass as arg 9 to capture-stats.sh: `bash $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/capture-stats.sh "$STATS_FILE" deepen-plan <agent> <step> <model> <stem> null $RUN_ID "total_tokens: N, tool_uses: N, duration_ms: N"`. If `<usage>` is absent, pass `"null"` as arg 9. See `$PLUGIN_ROOT/resources/stats-capture-schema.md` for field derivation rules. Increment the dispatch counter for each capture call.

**Model resolution per dispatch:** Use `sonnet` for agents with `model: sonnet` in their YAML frontmatter or an explicit `model: sonnet` dispatch parameter. Use `CACHED_MODEL` for `inherit`-model agents.

**Step field:** Use category--agent-name format. Categories: `research` (research agents), `review` (review agents), `synthesis` (synthesis + convergence-advisor), `red-team` (red team providers + MINOR triage), `readiness` (semantic-checks, plan-readiness-reviewer, plan-consolidator).

**Post-dispatch validation (end of command):**

```bash
bash $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/validate-stats.sh "$STATS_FILE" <DISPATCH_COUNT>
```

If validate-stats.sh reports a mismatch, warn with the names of missing agents. Do not fail the command.

**Check for interrupted current run:** If `$WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/manifest.json` exists AND its `status` is NOT `"readiness_complete"`, this may be an interrupted run. Skip to Phase 5 (Recovery).

Create `manifest.json` (the "current run" pointer):

```json
{
  "plan_path": "<full path to plan>",
  "plan_stem": "<plan-stem>",
  "origin_brainstorm": "<path from plan's origin: frontmatter, or null>",
  "started_at": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "status": "parsing",
  "run": <N>,
  "agents": []
}
```

**Manifest status lifecycle:** `parsing` → `discovered` → `agents_planned` → `synthesized` → `readiness_checking` → `readiness_complete`. Recovery (Phase 5) uses this to determine where to resume.

## Phase 1: Parse Plan Structure

Read the plan file and extract:
- Overview/Problem Statement
- Proposed Solution sections
- Technical Approach/Architecture
- Implementation phases/steps
- Technologies/frameworks mentioned
- Domain areas (data models, APIs, UI, security, performance, etc.)

Create a section manifest — a numbered list of major sections that will each get dedicated research.

**Review prior run findings (if any):** If prior runs exist, read the prior synthesis files (`run-<N-1>-synthesis.md`, etc.) to understand what was already found. This helps focus the new run on areas that need fresh analysis or deeper investigation. Prior findings may inform which agents to launch, but **do not skip agents just because a prior run covered the topic** — prefer re-running to ensure findings reflect the current state of the document.

**Review prior convergence signals (if any):** If a prior convergence file exists (`run-<N-1>-convergence.md`), read ONLY its `## Signals` section. Do NOT read the `## Recommendation` section — reading the prior recommendation would anchor the current run toward the same conclusion. By reading only the raw signals, the current run's convergence analysis computes its own fresh recommendation independently.

- **If prior convergence file exists:** Extract the Signals section and surface as context: "Prior run (run N-1) signals: [issue count trend, severity distribution, category mix, readiness result]." Check the plan file hash against the hash implied by the stale data indicator in the signals — if the signals note stale data, flag: "Prior convergence signals are stale — plan was modified since last run."
- **If no prior convergence file exists:** Note: "No prior convergence data available." This is expected on run 1 and on runs following a run where convergence analysis was not completed.

Update `manifest.json` status to `"discovered"`.

## Phase 2: Discover Available Skills, Learnings, and Agents

### Step 2a: Discover skills

**From system prompt:** Read the list of available skills from your system prompt. Skills appear in a separate section from subagent_types — they are listed with names and descriptions (e.g., `compound-workflows:brainstorming`, `compound-workflows:disk-persist-agents`). For each skill, check if its name or description overlaps with the plan's technologies or domain areas. Include matched skills in the manifest with type `"skill"` and fields: `name`, `description`, `type: "skill"`, `file: "agents/run-<N>/skill--<name>.md"`, `status: "pending"`. Skills do NOT have a `subagent_type` field — they are dispatched differently from agents.

**From local directories:** Discover project-local and user-level skills:

```bash
find .claude/skills ~/.claude/skills -name "SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null
```

For each discovered local skill, read its SKILL.md. Match skills to plan content by domain relevance.

### Step 2b: Discover learnings

```bash
find docs/solutions -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null
```

Read frontmatter of each learning file. Filter by tag/category overlap with plan technologies.

### Step 2c: Discover review/research agents

**From system prompt (native discovery):** Read the list of available subagent_types from your system prompt. For each entry whose subagent_type contains `:review:` or `:research:` in its path, extract: the agent name (last colon-delimited segment, e.g., `security-sentinel` from `compound-workflows:review:security-sentinel`) and the description (from the subagent_type listing). Skip entries containing `:workflow:`, `:design:`, or `:docs:` in their path.

Use `compound-workflows:` prefix for subagent_type. If dispatch fails with unknown subagent_type, try `compound:` prefix.

**User-defined agents:** Also include subagent_types that do NOT have a `compound-workflows:` prefix but match `*:review:*` or `*:research:*` patterns — these are user-defined agents (e.g., from `.claude/agents/review/go-reviewer.md`). User-defined agents are NOT checked in the invariant check — their absence is expected. compound-workflows agents always take priority in name conflicts.

**For each discovered agent, build a manifest entry:**

```json
{
  "name": "security-sentinel",
  "subagent_type": "compound-workflows:review:security-sentinel",
  "description": "Security auditor focused on vulnerabilities and OWASP compliance",
  "type": "review",
  "source": "dynamic",
  "model": "inherit",
  "file": "agents/run-<N>/review--security-sentinel.md",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

**File path derivation from subagent_type:** Extract category (second segment) and name (third segment), format as `<category>--<name>.md`. E.g., `compound-workflows:review:security-sentinel` → `review--security-sentinel.md`. For user-defined agents without the standard 3-segment format, use `review--<full-name>.md` (assume review category for `*:review:*` matched agents).

**Invariant check (hardcoded fallback):**

After dynamic discovery, verify that the roster includes at minimum: `security-sentinel` and `architecture-strategist`. Match on agent name portion only (last segment after `:`), not full subagent_type string.

If any invariant agent is missing, merge with the hardcoded fallback list of compound-workflows core agents (add-missing-only — preserve all dynamically-discovered agents including user-defined ones):

```
compound-workflows:review:security-sentinel
compound-workflows:review:architecture-strategist
compound-workflows:review:code-simplicity-reviewer
compound-workflows:review:performance-oracle
compound-workflows:review:pattern-recognition-specialist
compound-workflows:review:typescript-reviewer
compound-workflows:review:python-reviewer
compound-workflows:review:frontend-races-reviewer
compound-workflows:review:data-integrity-guardian
compound-workflows:review:data-migration-expert
compound-workflows:review:agent-native-reviewer
compound-workflows:review:deployment-verification-agent
compound-workflows:review:schema-drift-detector
compound-workflows:research:best-practices-researcher
compound-workflows:research:repo-research-analyst
compound-workflows:research:context-researcher
compound-workflows:research:framework-docs-researcher
compound-workflows:research:learnings-researcher
compound-workflows:research:git-history-analyzer
```

For fallback agents, set descriptions from hardcoded defaults:
- `security-sentinel`: "Security auditor focused on vulnerabilities and OWASP compliance"
- `architecture-strategist`: "Architecture reviewer validating design patterns and system integrity"
- `code-simplicity-reviewer`: "Code simplicity advocate checking for over-engineering and YAGNI violations"
- `performance-oracle`: "Performance analyst identifying bottlenecks and scalability issues"
- `pattern-recognition-specialist`: "Pattern recognition specialist detecting anti-patterns and naming inconsistencies"
- `typescript-reviewer`: "TypeScript reviewer focused on type safety and modern patterns"
- `python-reviewer`: "Python reviewer focused on idioms, packaging, and PEP compliance"
- `frontend-races-reviewer`: "Frontend concurrency reviewer checking for race conditions and stale closures"
- `data-integrity-guardian`: "Data integrity guardian validating consistency and constraint enforcement"
- `data-migration-expert`: "Data migration expert reviewing migration safety and rollback procedures"
- `agent-native-reviewer`: "Agent-native reviewer verifying automated action parity"
- `deployment-verification-agent`: "Deployment verification specialist producing go/no-go checklists"
- `schema-drift-detector`: "Schema drift detector checking for mismatches between code and schema"
- `best-practices-researcher`: "Best practices researcher surveying industry standards"
- `repo-research-analyst`: "Repository research analyst analyzing codebase patterns and conventions"
- `context-researcher`: "Context researcher gathering domain and technology context"
- `framework-docs-researcher`: "Framework documentation researcher checking official docs"
- `learnings-researcher`: "Learnings researcher mining institutional knowledge from prior solutions"
- `git-history-analyzer`: "Git history analyzer examining commit patterns and change frequency"

For fallback agents, set `model` to `"sonnet"` for research agents (`best-practices-researcher`, `repo-research-analyst`, `context-researcher`, `framework-docs-researcher`, `learnings-researcher`) and `"inherit"` for review agents and `git-history-analyzer` (which uses `inherit` per its agent definition). Set `source` to `"fallback"`.

If both invariant agents (`security-sentinel` AND `architecture-strategist`) are missing AND the total roster is < 5, treat as total failure — replace with the full fallback list (19 agents).

Log to user: "Dynamic discovery found N agents. Invariant check: [passed / merged M agents from fallback]."

**Deterministic post-discovery pipeline (bash — NOT LLM):**

After the LLM writes the initial manifest with discovered agents, run the following three-step deterministic pipeline in a single bash block:

```bash
# Post-discovery validation pipeline
# Reads manifest.json, applies dedup + C1 validation + cap, writes validated manifest

MANIFEST="$WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/manifest.json"

# Known compound-workflows agents (19 total)
KNOWN_AGENTS="security-sentinel architecture-strategist code-simplicity-reviewer performance-oracle pattern-recognition-specialist typescript-reviewer python-reviewer frontend-races-reviewer data-integrity-guardian data-migration-expert agent-native-reviewer deployment-verification-agent schema-drift-detector best-practices-researcher repo-research-analyst context-researcher framework-docs-researcher learnings-researcher git-history-analyzer"

# Step 1: Dedup — drop user-defined agents that collide with compound-workflows names
# For each agent, if its source is "user-defined" and a compound-workflows agent has the same name, drop it
DROPPED_DEDUP=""
# (Use jq to filter: keep all non-user-defined, and user-defined only if name not in compound-workflows set)

# Step 2: C1 validation — drop hallucinated compound-workflows agents
# Any agent with compound-workflows: prefix in subagent_type whose name is NOT in KNOWN_AGENTS → drop with warning
DROPPED_C1=""

# Step 3: 30-agent cap — keep compound-workflows first, truncate user-defined alphabetically
# Track the agent dispatch count as you build the manifest — use that tracked count here instead of querying with jq.
if [ "$AGENT_COUNT" -gt 30 ]; then
  # Keep all compound-workflows agents, sort user-defined alphabetically, truncate to fit 30
  echo "Warning: Agent count $AGENT_COUNT exceeds cap of 30. Truncating user-defined agents."
fi

# Write validated manifest back
echo "$VALIDATED" > "$MANIFEST"

# Report — use the agent count you tracked during manifest construction
echo "Post-discovery pipeline: dedup dropped [$DROPPED_DEDUP], C1 dropped [$DROPPED_C1], final count: $AGENT_COUNT"
```

This pipeline catches the undetectable failure mode: hallucinated agent names that pass both the invariant check and count threshold. User-defined agents (non-`compound-workflows:` prefix) are exempt from C1 validation — they are expected to be unknown.

### Step 2d: Build agent roster

For each matched skill, learning, and research topic, add entries to `manifest.json`. Review and research agents were already added during Step 2c discovery.

**When in doubt about whether to include an agent, include it.** Prefer producing the best output over reducing repeated work. It is always acceptable to re-run research on topics that prior runs covered — the document may have changed, and fresh analysis catches things prior runs missed.

### Step 2e: Relevance Assessment

Before launching agents, check whether the project's configured stack makes certain agents irrelevant. Read the `stack:` field from `compound-workflows.md`. If no `stack:` field is configured, skip nothing — all agents proceed to launch.

**Never-skip protection.** The following agents are always included regardless of stack configuration: `security-sentinel` and `architecture-strategist`. Check this protected list first. If an agent is protected, keep it and move on — do not evaluate skip conditions for protected agents.

**Stack-based skip rules:**

- If `stack: python` is configured, skip `typescript-reviewer` and `frontend-races-reviewer`. These agents review TypeScript-specific patterns and frontend race conditions that do not apply to Python projects.
- If `stack: typescript` is configured, skip `python-reviewer`. This agent reviews Python-specific idioms and packaging that do not apply to TypeScript projects.
- All other agents are always included. Do not infer skip decisions from plan keywords, file extensions, or domain analysis — only the explicit `stack:` value drives filtering. When in doubt about whether to include an agent, include it.

**Manifest tracking.** For each skipped agent, update its entry in `manifest.json` to `"status": "skipped"` with a `"reason"` field explaining why (e.g., `"reason": "stack: python — typescript-reviewer not applicable"`). Skipped agents remain in the manifest for traceability but are not launched.

**Report to user.** After applying skip rules, tell the user: "Skipping N agents (stack: \<value\>): [list of skipped agent names]. [Total remaining] agents launching." If no agents were skipped, say: "No agents skipped — [Total] agents launching."

> **Future expansion (v2.1):** Keyword-based filtering (matching plan technologies against agent descriptions) may be added after collecting empirical data from v2.0 runs. Until then, only the explicit `stack:` field drives skip decisions.

Update `manifest.json` status to `"agents_planned"`. Write the file to disk.

## Phase 3: Launch Agents in Batches

**CRITICAL: Context-lean agent launch pattern.**

### The Disk-Write Instruction Block

Every agent prompt MUST end with this block (fill in the actual path):

```
=== OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS (MANDATORY) ===

Write your COMPLETE findings to this file using the Write tool:
  $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/agents/run-<N>/<agent-file>

Include ALL analysis, code examples, recommendations, and references in that file.
Structure the file with clear markdown headers.

After writing the file, return ONLY a 2-3 sentence summary.
Example: "Found 3 security issues (1 critical). 2 performance recommendations. Full analysis at $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/example/agents/run-3/review--security-sentinel.md"

DO NOT return your full analysis in your response. The file IS the output.
```

### Batch Size

Launch agents in batches of **10-15 at a time**. Wait for each batch to complete (check file existence) before launching the next batch.

**Batch order:**
1. **Research agents first** (Explore agents for each plan section + Context7 queries + WebSearch). These produce context that review agents benefit from.
2. **Skill agents** (one per matched skill).
3. **Learning agents** (one per filtered learning).
4. **Review agents last** (security, performance, architecture, etc.). Review agents can reference research output files in their prompts.

### Launching a Batch

For each agent in the batch, read its `subagent_type` and `model` from the manifest entry. Dispatch using the Agent tool:

```
Agent(subagent_type: "<subagent_type from manifest>", run_in_background: true, prompt: "
You are a [role description — e.g., 'security reviewer focused on authentication and authorization vulnerabilities'].
[Agent-specific instructions — what to review/research, the plan content or path to read]

The plan file is at: <plan_path>
Read it directly.

[For review agents in later batches, optionally:]
Research findings are available at: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/agents/run-<N>/research--*.md
You may read these for additional context.

[If prior runs exist, optionally:]
Prior run findings are at: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/agents/run-<N-1>/
You may read these for context on what was previously found.

=== OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS (MANDATORY) ===
Write your COMPLETE findings to: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/agents/run-<N>/<agent-file>
[...rest of instruction block...]
")
```

**Model parameter rules:** For agents with `model: "inherit"` or no `model` field in the manifest, omit the `model` parameter entirely — let the Agent tool use the agent's frontmatter setting. For agents with an explicit model value (e.g., `model: "sonnet"`), pass it: `Agent(subagent_type: "...", model: "sonnet", ...)`. Only pass `model` when it is a valid Agent tool enum value (`"sonnet"`, `"opus"`, `"haiku"`). Do not pass `"inherit"` as a model value — it is not a valid Agent tool parameter.

### Monitoring Batch Completion

After launching a batch, poll for completion by checking file existence:

```bash
ls $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/agents/run-<N>/
```

Compare against expected files for this batch. When all files in the batch exist, the batch is complete. Move to the next batch.

**DO NOT call TaskOutput to retrieve full results.** The files on disk ARE the results.

If a background agent sends a task-notification, note the status but do not process the full result. Just check whether its output file exists.

After each batch completes, update the corresponding agent entries in `manifest.json` to `"status": "completed"`.

#### Stats Capture — Phase 3 Batched Agent Dispatches

If stats capture is enabled: when you receive each background Agent completion notification containing `<usage>`, extract `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, and `duration_ms` values from the `<usage>` notification and pass as arg 9 to `capture-stats.sh`. DO NOT call TaskOutput. The completion notification content beyond `<usage>` is not needed — the agent outputs are on disk. If `<usage>` is absent, pass `"null"` as arg 9.

For each agent in the batch, derive the step field from the agent's manifest entry: `<category>--<agent-name>` (e.g., `research--repo-research-analyst`, `review--security-sentinel`, `research--learnings-researcher`). The category comes from the manifest entry's `type` field (`research` or `review`).

```bash
bash $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/capture-stats.sh "$STATS_FILE" "deepen-plan" "<agent-name>" "<category>--<agent-name>" "<model>" "<plan-stem>" "null" "$RUN_ID" "total_tokens: N, tool_uses: N, duration_ms: N"
```

Model: use `sonnet` for research agents with `model: sonnet` in their YAML frontmatter. Use `$CACHED_MODEL` for review agents with `model: inherit`. Increment dispatch counter for each capture call.

### Handling Slow/Failed Agents

- If an agent hasn't produced output after 3 minutes, mark it as `"status": "timeout"` in the manifest and move on.
- If a task-notification reports failure, mark `"status": "failed"` and move on.
- Do not let one slow agent block the entire workflow.

## Phase 4: Synthesis

Once all batches are complete (or timed out), launch a **single synthesis agent**:

```
Agent(subagent_type: "general-purpose", prompt: "
You are synthesizing findings from multiple review and research agents into plan enhancements.

## Source Files

Read ALL agent output files from: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/agents/run-<N>/

List the directory first, then read each .md file.

## Original Plan

Read the plan at: <plan_path>

## Your Job

1. Read every agent output file
2. For each plan section, collect relevant findings from all agents
3. Deduplicate overlapping recommendations
4. Prioritize by impact (critical > high > medium > low)
5. Flag any contradictions between agents

## Output

Write TWO files:

### File 1: Enhanced Plan
Write to: <plan_path>
Preserve all original content. For each section that has findings, add:

### Review Findings

**Critical:**
- [finding with source agent name]

**Recommendations:**
- [recommendation with source agent name]

**Implementation Details:**
- [concrete code/config examples]

### File 2: Synthesis Summary
Write to: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/run-<N>-synthesis.md
Include:
- Date, run number, and agent count
- Top findings by severity
- Sections with most feedback
- Agents that found nothing relevant
- Any contradictions between agents

=== OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS (MANDATORY) ===
After writing both files, return a brief summary of the top 5 findings.
")
```

#### Stats Capture — Synthesis Agent

If stats capture is enabled: the synthesis agent is a foreground `general-purpose` Agent dispatch. Extract `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, and `duration_ms` values from the `<usage>` notification and call:

```bash
bash $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/capture-stats.sh "$STATS_FILE" "deepen-plan" "general-purpose" "synthesis--plan-synthesizer" "$CACHED_MODEL" "<plan-stem>" "null" "$RUN_ID" "total_tokens: N, tool_uses: N, duration_ms: N"
```

Increment dispatch counter.

**After synthesis, archive the current run tracking files:**

```bash
# Copy current manifest as run-specific archive
cp $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/manifest.json $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/run-<N>-manifest.json
# Also copy synthesis to the standard location for easy access
cp $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/run-<N>-synthesis.md $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/synthesis.md
```

Update `manifest.json` status to `"synthesized"`.

### Synthesis Gate: Triage All Findings

After synthesis, read the synthesis summary and the enhanced plan. Collect ALL findings — not just contradictions. Present them to the user in a consolidated triage.

**Step 1: Summary.** Show the user a brief overview: "Synthesis complete. N CRITICAL, M SERIOUS, P MINOR findings from K agents. Here's the summary: [top 5 findings]."

**Step 2: Contradictions first.** If agents contradicted each other, present each via **AskUserQuestion**:

"Synthesis found conflicting recommendations: [summary]. How should we resolve this?"
- **Choose one** — adopt the recommended approach, record the user's reasoning and note the alternative was considered
- **Defer** — carry into the plan's Open Questions section with the user's stated reason
- **Needs more research** — flag for the red team to investigate specifically

**Step 3: CRITICAL and SERIOUS findings.** For each CRITICAL or SERIOUS finding that the synthesis agent wrote into the plan, use **AskUserQuestion**:

"[Finding summary — source agent(s)]. The synthesis agent applied this to the plan. How should we handle it?"
- **Accept** — keep the change as-is
- **Modify** — the user provides additional context or corrections; update the plan accordingly (record their reasoning)
- **Reject** — remove the change from the plan (record why)
- **Defer** — move to Open Questions with rationale

**Step 4: MINOR findings — three-category triage.** Synthesis MINOR changes are already applied to the plan. The triage reviews these applied changes and categorizes them as needing correction, being appropriate (keep), or needing complex adjustment.

**Step 4a: Dispatch MINOR categorization subagent.** Launch an Agent subagent to categorize synthesis MINOR findings:

```
Agent(subagent_type: "general-purpose", prompt: "
You are a MINOR finding triage agent reviewing synthesis changes ALREADY APPLIED to a plan. Your job is to categorize each MINOR change — not propose new edits.

## Source Files

Read the synthesis summary at: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/run-<N>-synthesis.md
Read the current plan at: <plan_path>

## Categorization

For each MINOR finding the synthesis agent applied, categorize it into one of three categories:

### Category 1: Fixable Now
The synthesis change needs a small correction or revert. All three criteria must hold:
1. **Unambiguous** — only one reasonable correction exists
2. **Low effort** — a one-line or few-line edit, not a structural change
3. **Low risk** — safe to change without ripple effects; no user decisions or reasoning involved

For each fixable item, provide BOTH:
- `old_string`: the text currently in the plan (the synthesis-applied version)
- `new_string`: the corrected text (either the pre-synthesis original from the synthesis summary for reverts, or a corrected version for corrections)

### Category 2: Needs Manual Review
The synthesis change needs complex adjustment — fails at least one fixability criterion. Note which criterion fails.

### Category 3: No Action Needed
The synthesis change was appropriate — keep as-is. Note why (e.g., 'accurate addition', 'correctly captures agent finding').

## Conflict Detection
If two fixable items propose conflicting edits to the same section, re-categorize both as 'needs manual review' with the conflict noted.

## Output Format

Write your categorization to: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/agents/run-<N>/minor-triage-synthesis.md

Use this structure (numbers are sequential across all categories):

# MINOR Triage Categorization (Synthesis)

## Summary
- Total: N MINOR findings
- Fixable now: M items
- Needs manual review: K items
- No action needed: J items

## Fixable Now

### 1. [Finding summary]
- Source: [synthesis agent / original agent name]
- Issue: [what needs correction or revert]
- old_string: |
  [exact text currently in plan to replace]
- new_string: |
  [corrected or reverted text]

## Needs Manual Review

### M+1. [Finding summary]
- Source: [agent name]
- Why manual: [which fixability criterion fails]

## No Action Needed

### M+K+1. [Finding summary]
- Source: [agent name]
- Reason: [why the change was appropriate]

=== OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS (MANDATORY) ===
Write your COMPLETE categorization to: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/agents/run-<N>/minor-triage-synthesis.md
After writing the file, return ONLY a 2-3 sentence summary.
DO NOT return your full analysis in your response. The file IS the output.
")
```

**Stats Capture — Synthesis MINOR Triage:** If stats capture is enabled, this is a foreground `general-purpose` Agent dispatch. Extract `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, and `duration_ms` values from the `<usage>` notification and call:

```bash
bash $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/capture-stats.sh "$STATS_FILE" "deepen-plan" "general-purpose" "synthesis--minor-triage" "$CACHED_MODEL" "<plan-stem>" "null" "$RUN_ID" "total_tokens: N, tool_uses: N, duration_ms: N"
```

Increment dispatch counter.

**Step 4b: Present three-category triage to user.** Read the categorization file from `$WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/agents/run-<N>/minor-triage-synthesis.md`. Present to the user (omit any empty category section):

**AskUserQuestion:**

"N MINOR synthesis changes triaged:

**Fixable now** (M items — corrections/reverts to synthesis changes):
1. [summary] → [proposed correction]
2. [summary] → [proposed correction]

**Needs manual review** (K items):
3. [summary]

**No action needed** (J items — synthesis changes to keep as-is):
4. [summary] — [reason]

What would you like to do?"

Options:
1. **Apply all fixes + acknowledge no-action items** (Recommended)
2. **Apply specific fixes** (e.g., "1, 2") + acknowledge rest
3. **Review all individually**
4. **Acknowledge all** (no corrections)

**Edge cases:**
- **Zero fixable items:** Omit "Fixable now" section. Remove "Apply all fixes" option. Recommend "Review all individually" if manual-review items exist, or "Acknowledge all" if only no-action items.
- **All fixable items:** Omit empty sections.
- **User rejects all proposed fixes:** Record as `**Acknowledged (batch):**` with "(M fixable declined)" annotation.

**Partial acceptance parsing:** Interpret the user's natural language response (e.g., "1, 3", "all except 2", "first two"). If ambiguous, ask for clarification rather than guessing.

**Step 4c: Apply corrections and verify.** For each accepted fix:

1. Apply using the Edit tool with the `old_string`/`new_string` from the categorization output (one edit per fix, sequential). For reverts: `old_string` is the synthesis-applied text, `new_string` is the pre-synthesis original from the synthesis summary. For corrections: `old_string` is the synthesis-applied text, `new_string` is the corrected text.
2. After all edits applied, re-read the modified sections of the plan.
3. Verify each applied edit matches the proposal by content (not line number — earlier edits may shift lines).
4. If drift detected (edit doesn't match proposal), flag to user before proceeding.

**Step 4d: Present "needs manual review" items individually.** For each item categorized as "needs manual review," present via **AskUserQuestion** with the same options as CRITICAL/SERIOUS findings (Step 3):

"[Finding summary — synthesis change needs complex adjustment]. How should we handle it?"
- **Accept** — keep the synthesis change as-is
- **Modify** — the user provides corrections; update the plan accordingly (record their reasoning)
- **Reject** — revert the synthesis change from the plan (record why)
- **Defer** — move to Open Questions with rationale

**Step 5: Apply.** Update the plan with all accepted/modified findings. For rejected, deferred, and modified findings, replace the original finding text with a resolution line that includes a provenance pointer. Record the user's reasoning for all non-trivial decisions.

**Resolution line format by verdict:**
- **Accepted:** `[finding summary]. [agent-name, see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/run-<N>-synthesis.md]`
- **Modified:** `[modified finding]. User: [reasoning]. [agent-name, see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/run-<N>-synthesis.md]`
- **Rejected:** `[finding summary]. User: [reasoning]. [agent-name, see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/run-<N>-synthesis.md]`
- **Deferred:** `[finding summary]. User: [reasoning]. [agent-name, see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/run-<N>-synthesis.md]`

**MINOR triage provenance formats:**
- **Applied fixes:** `**Fixed (batch):** M MINOR synthesis corrections applied. [see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/agents/run-<N>/minor-triage-synthesis.md]`
- **No-action items:** `**Acknowledged (batch):** J MINOR synthesis changes kept as-is. [see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/agents/run-<N>/minor-triage-synthesis.md]`
- **User declines all fixes:** `**Acknowledged (batch):** N MINOR synthesis changes accepted (M fixable declined). [see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/agents/run-<N>/minor-triage-synthesis.md]`
- **Partial acceptance:** `**Fixed (batch):** M of N fixable MINOR corrections applied (items 1, 3). [see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/agents/run-<N>/minor-triage-synthesis.md]`
- **Manual review items:** individual resolution lines using the Step 3 CRITICAL/SERIOUS format above

**Best-effort fallback:** If the source file path is unavailable, use the agent name only (omit the `see` clause).

**Deferred items moving to Open Questions** also get provenance pointers — include the same `[agent-name, see ...]` suffix so future sessions can trace the origin.

**Do not proceed to red team with unresolved contradictions.** The red team should challenge a coherent plan, not arbitrate between the synthesis's own internal conflicts.

## Phase 4.5: Red Team Challenge

After synthesis, challenge the enhanced plan with three different model providers in parallel. The research and review agents are all Claude-based and share similar training biases — different models catch blind spots they'd collectively miss. Using three providers maximizes coverage.

### Step 1: Launch Red Team via 3 Providers (parallel)

Launch all three providers in parallel. Each reviews independently — no provider reads another's critique. This maximizes diversity of perspective (reading prior critiques anchors models and reduces independent insight). Deduplication happens at triage.

**Runtime detection:** For Gemini and OpenAI providers, detect which dispatch method is available. Check once per session; if multiple options exist for a provider, ask the user which they prefer (e.g., `clink gemini` for direct file access, or `pal chat` with a specific model like `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`).

```bash
which gemini 2>/dev/null && echo "GEMINI_CLI=available" || echo "GEMINI_CLI=not_available"
which codex 2>/dev/null && echo "CODEX_CLI=available" || echo "CODEX_CLI=not_available"
# PAL: check if mcp__pal__chat is available as a tool  # context-lean-exempt
```

**Provider 1 — Gemini:**

*If Gemini CLI is available* — use `clink` via subagent:

```
Agent(subagent_type: "compound-workflows:workflow:red-team-relay", model: "sonnet", run_in_background: true, prompt: "

  role: codereviewer
  prompt: "You are a red team reviewer for a software implementation plan. Your job is to find flaws, not validate.

Read the enhanced plan and its synthesis summary. Then identify:
1. **Unexamined assumptions** — What does the plan take for granted?
2. **Architecture risks** — Where could the technical approach fail at scale or under pressure?
3. **Missing steps** — What implementation work is implied but not planned?
4. **Dependency risks** — What external factors could derail the plan?
5. **Overengineering** — Where is the plan more complex than necessary? Is it doing more than what was asked? Did research agents or prior analysis introduce unnecessary complexity?

7. **Problem selection** — Is this the right problem to solve? Were alternatives to the entire approach considered?

**Provider 3 — Claude Opus (via Agent subagent, NOT PAL):**

Do NOT use PAL for Claude — use an Agent subagent instead (direct file access, no token relay overhead):

You are a red team reviewer for a software implementation plan. Your job is to find flaws, not validate. Approach this adversarially — assume the plan has weaknesses and find them.

Write your COMPLETE findings to: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/agents/run-<N>/red-team--opus.md
After writing the file, return ONLY a 2-3 sentence summary.
")
```

**Execution:** Launch all three as background Agents in a single message. Wait for all to complete before proceeding to Step 2.

**DO NOT call TaskOutput to retrieve red team results.** Monitor completion by polling for output files:

```bash
ls $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/agents/run-<N>/red-team--*.md 2>/dev/null
```

When all expected red team files exist (up to 3), proceed to Step 2. If a task-notification arrives, note it but check for the output file rather than processing the notification content.

**If PAL MCP is not available:** Run only the Claude Opus Agent subagent (Provider 3 above). The red team will have a single perspective instead of three, but this is an acceptable fallback.

Update `manifest.json` to include all three red team agent entries with `"status": "completed"` as each finishes.

#### Stats Capture — Red Team Dispatches

If stats capture is enabled: when you receive each background Agent completion notification containing `<usage>`, extract `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, and `duration_ms` values from the `<usage>` notification and pass as arg 9 to `capture-stats.sh`. DO NOT call TaskOutput. If `<usage>` is absent, pass `"null"` as arg 9.

For the 2 `red-team-relay` agents (Gemini, OpenAI) — model is `sonnet` (dispatch parameter override):

```bash
bash $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/capture-stats.sh "$STATS_FILE" "deepen-plan" "red-team-relay" "red-team--gemini" "sonnet" "<plan-stem>" "null" "$RUN_ID" "total_tokens: N, tool_uses: N, duration_ms: N"
bash $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/capture-stats.sh "$STATS_FILE" "deepen-plan" "red-team-relay" "red-team--openai" "sonnet" "<plan-stem>" "null" "$RUN_ID" "total_tokens: N, tool_uses: N, duration_ms: N"
```

For the `general-purpose` agent (Claude Opus) — no explicit model, use `CACHED_MODEL`:

```bash
bash $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/capture-stats.sh "$STATS_FILE" "deepen-plan" "general-purpose" "red-team--opus" "$CACHED_MODEL" "<plan-stem>" "null" "$RUN_ID" "total_tokens: N, tool_uses: N, duration_ms: N"
```

Track the number of red team agents actually dispatched (2-3 depending on PAL availability). Increment dispatch counter for each.

### Step 2: Surface CRITICAL and SERIOUS Items

Read all three red team critiques (or whichever completed). Deduplicate findings across providers — if multiple models flag the same issue, note it once with the strongest severity rating.

For each CRITICAL or SERIOUS item, present to the user via **AskUserQuestion**:

"[Challenge summary — note which provider(s) flagged it]. How should we handle this?"
- **Valid — update the plan** (edit the plan to address it)
- **Disagree — note why** (add a footnote with the counterargument)
- **Defer — flag for implementation** (add to a "Risks and Open Questions" section in the plan)

Apply the user's decision to the plan file. **Include the user's stated reasoning** — not just "disagreed" but *why* (e.g., "Disagreed: user noted the plan already handles this via the retry middleware in Phase 3"). The rationale is more valuable than the verdict — it prevents future sessions from relitigating settled decisions.

**Provenance pointers for red team resolutions:** Each resolution line should include: `[red-team--<provider>, see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/agents/run-<N>/red-team--<provider>.md]`. For findings flagged by multiple providers, list all provider names with one path (e.g., `[red-team--gemini, red-team--opus, see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/agents/run-<N>/red-team--gemini.md]`).

**Any CRITICAL items the user defers MUST appear in the Phase 6 report.** The `/do:work` command needs to know about unresolved challenges before implementation begins.

### Step 3: Surface MINOR Findings — Three-Category Triage

After all CRITICAL and SERIOUS items are resolved, check for MINOR findings across all three red team critiques.

If MINOR findings exist, use the three-category triage pattern:

**Step 3a: Dispatch MINOR categorization subagent.** Launch an Agent subagent to categorize red team MINOR findings:

```
Agent(subagent_type: "general-purpose", prompt: "
You are a MINOR finding triage agent reviewing red team findings for a plan. Your job is to categorize each MINOR finding and propose fixes where possible.

## Source Files

Read all three red team files from: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/agents/run-<N>/
- red-team--gemini.md
- red-team--openai.md
- red-team--opus.md

Read the plan at: <plan_path>

## Categorization

Deduplicate MINOR findings across providers — if multiple models flag the same issue, note it once. For each unique MINOR finding, categorize it into one of three categories:

### Category 1: Fixable Now
The finding suggests a concrete edit that meets all three criteria:
1. **Unambiguous** — only one reasonable fix exists
2. **Low effort** — a one-line or few-line edit, not a structural change
3. **Low risk** — safe to change without ripple effects; no user decisions or reasoning involved

For each fixable item, provide BOTH:
- `old_string`: the text currently in the plan to replace
- `new_string`: the corrected text

### Category 2: Needs Manual Review
Valid finding but fails at least one fixability criterion. Note which criterion fails and which provider(s) flagged it.

### Category 3: No Action Needed
Observation with no concrete edit implied. Note why (e.g., 'already addressed in Phase 3', 'cosmetic preference not a deficiency', 'out of scope for this plan').

## Conflict Detection
If two fixable items propose conflicting edits to the same section, re-categorize both as 'needs manual review' with the conflict noted.

## Output Format

Write your categorization to: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/agents/run-<N>/minor-triage-redteam.md

Use this structure (numbers are sequential across all categories):

# MINOR Triage Categorization (Red Team)

## Summary

- Fixable now: M items
- Needs manual review: K items
- No action needed: J items

DO NOT return your full analysis in your response. The file IS the output.
")
```

**Stats Capture — Red Team MINOR Triage:** If stats capture is enabled, this is a foreground `general-purpose` Agent dispatch. Extract `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, and `duration_ms` values from the `<usage>` notification and call:

```bash
bash $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/capture-stats.sh "$STATS_FILE" "deepen-plan" "general-purpose" "red-team--minor-triage" "$CACHED_MODEL" "<plan-stem>" "null" "$RUN_ID" "total_tokens: N, tool_uses: N, duration_ms: N"
```

Increment dispatch counter.

**Step 3b: Present three-category triage to user.** Read the categorization file from `$WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/agents/run-<N>/minor-triage-redteam.md`. Present to the user (omit any empty category section):

**AskUserQuestion:**

"N MINOR findings from red team review:

**Fixable now** (M items):
1. [summary] → [proposed edit]
2. [summary] → [proposed edit]

**Needs manual review** (K items):
3. [summary]

**No action needed** (J items):
4. [summary] — [reason]

What would you like to do?"

Options:
1. **Apply all fixes + acknowledge no-action items** (Recommended)
2. **Apply specific fixes** (e.g., "1, 2") + acknowledge rest
3. **Review all individually**
4. **Acknowledge all** (no fixes)

**Edge cases:**
- **Zero fixable items:** Omit "Fixable now" section. Remove "Apply all fixes" option. Recommend "Review all individually" if manual-review items exist, or "Acknowledge all" if only no-action items.
- **All fixable items:** Omit empty sections.
- **User rejects all proposed fixes:** Record as `**Acknowledged (batch):**` with "(M fixable declined)" annotation.

**Partial acceptance parsing:** Interpret the user's natural language response (e.g., "1, 3", "all except 2", "first two"). If ambiguous, ask for clarification rather than guessing.

**Step 3c: Apply fixes and verify.** For each accepted fix:

1. Apply using the Edit tool with the `old_string`/`new_string` from the categorization output (one edit per fix, sequential).
2. After all edits applied, re-read the modified sections of the plan.
3. Verify each applied edit matches the proposal by content (not line number — earlier edits may shift lines).
4. If drift detected (edit doesn't match proposal), flag to user before proceeding.

**Step 3d: Present "needs manual review" items individually.** For each item categorized as "needs manual review," present via **AskUserQuestion** with the same options as CRITICAL/SERIOUS findings (Step 2):

"[Finding summary — note which provider(s) flagged it]. How should we handle this?"
- **Valid — update the plan** (edit the plan to address it)
- **Disagree — note why** (add a footnote with the counterargument)
- **Defer — flag for implementation** (add to a "Risks and Open Questions" section in the plan)

Apply the user's decision to the plan file. Include the user's stated reasoning.

**MINOR triage provenance formats:**
- **Applied fixes:** `**Fixed (batch):** M MINOR red team fixes applied. [see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/agents/run-<N>/minor-triage-redteam.md]`
- **No-action items:** `**Acknowledged (batch):** J MINOR red team findings, no action needed. [see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/agents/run-<N>/minor-triage-redteam.md]`
- **User declines all fixes:** `**Acknowledged (batch):** N MINOR red team findings accepted (M fixable declined). [see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/agents/run-<N>/minor-triage-redteam.md]`
- **Partial acceptance:** `**Fixed (batch):** M of N fixable MINOR red team items applied (items 1, 3). [see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/agents/run-<N>/minor-triage-redteam.md]`
- **Manual review items:** individual resolution lines using the Step 2 provenance pointer format: `[red-team--<provider>, see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<stem>/agents/run-<N>/red-team--<provider>.md]`

## Phase 5: Recovery (Resume After Compaction)

If `$WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/manifest.json` exists when this command starts:

1. Read the manifest to get the current run number
2. Check which agent output files actually exist on disk:
   ```bash
   ls $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/agents/run-<N>/
   ```
3. Compare against the agent roster in the manifest
4. **Dispatch method:** For each agent that needs re-running, check its manifest entry:
   - If the entry has a `subagent_type` field → dispatch via Agent tool: `Agent(subagent_type: "<value>", ...)`
   - If the entry does NOT have a `subagent_type` field (pre-migration manifest) → dispatch via Task using the `name` field with inline role description: `Task <name> (...)`
   - When dispatching via Agent tool, filter the `model` field: if `model` is `"inherit"` or absent, omit the `model` parameter entirely. Only pass `model` when it is a valid Agent tool enum value (`"sonnet"`, `"opus"`, `"haiku"`).
   - If a pre-migration manifest entry lacks a `description` field, use the hardcoded fallback descriptions from Phase 2 Step 2c.
5. Any agent with `"status": "pending"` or `"status": "timeout"` whose file does NOT exist → needs re-running
6. If all agent files exist → skip to Phase 4 (Synthesis)
7. If some are missing → resume from Phase 3, launching only missing agents

Tell the user: "Resuming deepen-plan run <N> from <timestamp>. X/Y agents completed. Re-launching Z agents."

**Readiness-phase recovery:**
- If manifest status is `readiness_checking`: check if readiness output files exist at `$WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/readiness/run-<N>/`. If `report.md` exists, skip check dispatch and go directly to consolidator dispatch (Phase 5.5 "If issues found" step 1). Otherwise, re-run all checks and reviewer from the start of Phase 5.5.
- If manifest status is `readiness_complete`: skip to Phase 6.

## Phase 5.5: Plan Readiness Check

After all synthesis and red team edits are applied, verify the plan is work-ready. The command dispatches all checks directly (flat dispatch — same pattern as plan.md Phase 6.7).

**Dispatch:**

Set manifest status to `readiness_checking`.

1. Read config from compound-workflows.md under the `## Plan Readiness` heading. Read flat keys (`plan_readiness_skip_checks`, `plan_readiness_provenance_expiry_days`, `plan_readiness_verification_source_policy`) and construct the parameter objects to pass to agents. Apply skip_checks filtering.
2. Use the `$PLUGIN_ROOT` already resolved in Phase 0.
3. Create output directory: `mkdir -p $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/readiness/run-<N>/checks/`
4. Run 3 mechanical check scripts in parallel (bash), using the resolved `$PLUGIN_ROOT`:
   - `$PLUGIN_ROOT/agents/workflow/plan-checks/stale-values.sh <plan-path> <output-dir>/checks/stale-values.md`
   - `$PLUGIN_ROOT/agents/workflow/plan-checks/broken-references.sh <plan-path> <output-dir>/checks/broken-references.md`
   - `$PLUGIN_ROOT/agents/workflow/plan-checks/audit-trail-bloat.sh <plan-path> <output-dir>/checks/audit-trail-bloat.md`
5. If all 5 semantic passes are in skip_checks, skip the semantic agent dispatch entirely. Otherwise, dispatch 1 semantic checks agent (background Agent):
   - `Agent(subagent_type: "compound-workflows:workflow:plan-checks:semantic-checks", run_in_background: true, prompt: "[pass: plan file path, output path (<output-dir>/checks/semantic-checks.md), mode (full), skip_checks, provenance settings]...")`
   - Pass: plan file path, output path (`<output-dir>/checks/semantic-checks.md`), mode (`full`), skip_checks, provenance settings
5. Wait for all checks to complete (3-minute timeout for scripts, 5-10 minutes for semantic agent). After timeout, remove any orphaned .tmp files: `rm -f <output-dir>/checks/*.tmp`. If rate limits are hit, retry with exponential backoff.
6. Dispatch plan-readiness-reviewer (foreground Agent):
   - `Agent(subagent_type: "compound-workflows:workflow:plan-readiness-reviewer", prompt: "You are a plan readiness reviewer evaluating whether a plan is ready for implementation. [pass: plan file path, plan stem, output directory (run-numbered), check output file paths, mode, config]...")`
   - Pass: plan file path, plan stem, output directory (run-numbered), check output file paths, mode, config
7. Show the reviewer's summary to the user: "Plan readiness check: [summary]"

The readiness run number is the deepen-plan run number, not an independent counter. Pass the deepen-plan run number to the readiness dispatch.

Keep Phase 5.5 focused on dispatch + response handling. The detailed logic lives in the check scripts and agent files.

#### Stats Capture — Readiness Dispatches

If stats capture is enabled: capture stats for each readiness agent dispatch.

**Semantic-checks agent** (background Agent — extract `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, and `duration_ms` values from the completion notification's `<usage>` and pass as arg 9. If `<usage>` is absent, pass `"null"` as arg 9):

```bash
bash $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/capture-stats.sh "$STATS_FILE" "deepen-plan" "semantic-checks" "readiness--semantic-checks" "$CACHED_MODEL" "<plan-stem>" "null" "$RUN_ID" "total_tokens: N, tool_uses: N, duration_ms: N"
```

**Plan-readiness-reviewer** (foreground Agent — extract `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, and `duration_ms` values from the inline response's `<usage>` notification and pass as arg 9. If `<usage>` is absent, pass `"null"` as arg 9):

```bash
bash $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/capture-stats.sh "$STATS_FILE" "deepen-plan" "plan-readiness-reviewer" "readiness--plan-readiness-reviewer" "$CACHED_MODEL" "<plan-stem>" "null" "$RUN_ID" "total_tokens: N, tool_uses: N, duration_ms: N"
```

Increment dispatch counter for each. If semantic-checks was skipped (all 5 passes in skip_checks), do not increment for it.

**If issues found:**

1. Dispatch plan-consolidator (foreground Agent): `Agent(subagent_type: "compound-workflows:workflow:plan-consolidator", prompt: "You are a plan consolidator applying auto-fixes and presenting guardrailed items. [pass: plan file path, reviewer report path, consolidation report output path]...")`. Pass: plan file path, reviewer report path, consolidation report output path.

   **Stats Capture — Plan Consolidator:** If stats capture is enabled, extract `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, and `duration_ms` values from the inline response's `<usage>` notification and call:

   ```bash
   bash $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/capture-stats.sh "$STATS_FILE" "deepen-plan" "plan-consolidator" "readiness--plan-consolidator" "$CACHED_MODEL" "<plan-stem>" "null" "$RUN_ID" "total_tokens: N, tool_uses: N, duration_ms: N"
   ```

   Increment dispatch counter.

2. Consolidator applies auto-fixes, then presents guardrailed items to user.
3. After consolidation, re-run checks in `verify-only` mode: re-run all 3 mechanical scripts (type: mechanical), re-dispatch semantic agent with `mode: verify-only` (runs contradictions + underspecification only; skips unresolved-disputes, accretion, external-verification). Dispatch reviewer again.
4. If verify finds new issues: present remaining findings to user directly.
   User options: resolve now, defer to Open Questions, or dismiss.
5. Show user: "Readiness check complete. N auto-fixes applied, M items resolved, K deferred."

**If zero issues found:**

Skip consolidator and re-verify. Show: "Plan readiness check: no issues found."

**If reviewer fails:**

Warn: "Readiness check failed — consider running again before starting work."

Set manifest status to `readiness_complete`.

## Phase 5.75: Convergence Analysis

After readiness checks complete, run convergence analysis to give the user data-driven guidance on whether to iterate further. This phase produces a convergence file that Phase 6 presents.

### Step 1: Run convergence-signals.sh

Compute the 5 structured convergence metrics by running the script:

Use the `$PLUGIN_ROOT` resolved in Phase 0:

```bash
bash "$PLUGIN_ROOT/agents/workflow/plan-checks/convergence-signals.sh" \
  "$WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>" \
  "$WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/readiness" \
  "$WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/run-<N>-convergence-signals.txt"
```

Capture the script's stdout into a variable — this is the raw signal text that will be pasted into the agent dispatch prompt.

If the script fails (non-zero exit), log the error and proceed to the fallback in Step 4.

### Step 2: Dispatch convergence-advisor agent

Determine the prior convergence file path:

```bash
ls $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/run-*-convergence.md 2>/dev/null
```

If a prior convergence file exists (e.g., `run-<N-1>-convergence.md`), use its path. Otherwise, use `"none"`.

Dispatch the convergence-advisor agent as a background Agent:

```
Agent(subagent_type: "compound-workflows:workflow:convergence-advisor", run_in_background: true, prompt: "
You are a convergence advisor analyzing whether a plan has stabilized across deepen-plan iterations.

Convergence signals (from convergence-signals.sh):
<raw script stdout pasted here>

Files to read:
- Current synthesis summary: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/run-<N>-synthesis.md
- Prior convergence file: <path to prior convergence file, or 'none' if first run>

Output path: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/run-<N>-convergence.md

=== OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS (MANDATORY) ===
Write your COMPLETE convergence analysis to: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/run-<N>-convergence.md
After writing the file, return ONLY a 2-3 sentence summary.
DO NOT return your full analysis in your response. The file IS the output.
")
```

### Step 3: Poll for convergence file

Poll for the convergence file with a 3-minute timeout:

```bash
ls $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/run-<N>-convergence.md 2>/dev/null
```

Check every 15-20 seconds. When the file exists, the agent has completed. Proceed to Phase 6.

If a task-notification arrives, note the status but verify file existence rather than processing the notification content.

**Stats Capture — Convergence Advisor:** If stats capture is enabled: when the background Agent completion notification arrives containing `<usage>`, extract `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, and `duration_ms` values and pass as arg 9:

```bash
bash $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/capture-stats.sh "$STATS_FILE" "deepen-plan" "convergence-advisor" "synthesis--convergence-advisor" "$CACHED_MODEL" "<plan-stem>" "null" "$RUN_ID" "total_tokens: N, tool_uses: N, duration_ms: N"
```

Increment dispatch counter. If the agent times out, record with `--timeout`:

```bash
bash $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/capture-stats.sh --timeout "$STATS_FILE" "deepen-plan" "convergence-advisor" "synthesis--convergence-advisor" "$CACHED_MODEL" "<plan-stem>" "null" "$RUN_ID"
```

### Step 4: Fallback on failure or timeout

If the convergence-advisor agent fails or times out (3 minutes), write a script-only convergence file using the metrics already captured from Step 1:

```markdown
## Recommendation

Convergence analysis incomplete — agent did not finish. Review script signals below and decide manually.

Recommended next step: Review signals and decide

## Signals

- **Run:** <N>
- **Complete:** false
- **Issue count trend:** <from script stdout>
- **Severity distribution:** <from script stdout>
- **Change magnitude:** <from script stdout>
- **Deferred items:** <from script stdout>
- **Readiness result:** <from script stdout>
- **Category mix:** unavailable (agent did not complete)

## Analysis

Agent timed out or failed. Only script-computed signals are available. The category mix (genuine vs edit-induced classification) requires agent analysis and is not available.
```

Write this to `$WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/run-<N>-convergence.md` so Phase 6 always has a convergence file to read.

**No manifest status change:** Convergence is part of the Phase 5.5→6 flow, not a separate manifest status. If interrupted before Phase 6, Phase 6 checks for convergence file existence and re-runs Phase 5.75 if the file is missing.

## Phase 6: Cleanup and Report

After synthesis, red team challenge, plan readiness check, and convergence analysis are complete:

1. Tell the user the plan has been enhanced
2. Show a consolidated summary of all findings — both synthesis and red team — with final disposition (accepted, modified, rejected, deferred). **Every finding must have a disposition.** Nothing untriaged.
3. **Plan Readiness summary:** Include a "Plan Readiness" section reporting: total issues found by check type, auto-fixes applied by the consolidator, user decisions (resolved/deferred/dismissed), and any items deferred to Open Questions. If zero issues were found, state "Plan readiness check: no issues found."
4. **If any items were deferred (from synthesis, red team, OR readiness):** Flag them explicitly with count by severity: "Note: N deferred items remain (X CRITICAL, Y SERIOUS, Z MINOR). `/do:work` will surface these before execution."
5. **Convergence summary:** Read the `## Recommendation` and `## Signals` sections from `$WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/run-<N>-convergence.md`. Present the recommendation and key signals to the user.
   - **If convergence file exists:** Show "Convergence analysis (run N): [recommendation summary]" followed by the key signals (issue count trend, severity distribution, category mix, readiness result).
   - **If convergence file is missing:** Show "Convergence analysis was not completed. Consider running `/do:deepen-plan` again for convergence guidance."
   - **Context-lean:** Read only the Recommendation and Signals sections, not the full Analysis section.
6. **Do NOT delete any working files.** All agent outputs, manifests, and synthesis files are retained.
7. **Work readiness check:** Flag if any steps are oversized (20+ checkboxes) or share heavy reference data — the `/do:work` orchestrator should split them into smaller issues or point subagents to the file path.
8. Offer options. **Annotate the recommended next step** based on the convergence recommendation:
   - **View diff**: `git diff <plan_path>`
   - **View full synthesis**: Read `$WORKFLOWS_ROOT/deepen-plan/<plan-stem>/run-<N>-synthesis.md`
   - **Start `/do:work`**: Begin implementing (include any work-readiness flags) — **[Recommended]** if convergence says "converged" / "ready for work"
   - **Deepen further**: Run another round on specific sections — **[Recommended]** if convergence says "recommend another run"
   - **Consolidate first, then deepen**: Run the consolidator to clean up edit-induced churn before another round — **[Recommended]** if convergence says "consolidate"
   - **Revert**: `git checkout <plan_path>`

   **Precedence rule:** The convergence recommendation takes precedence for "next step" guidance since it already incorporates readiness as an input signal. If readiness passes clean but convergence recommends another run (e.g., genuine CRITICAL findings remain), the convergence recommendation governs. If no convergence file exists, omit the [Recommended] annotation entirely.

### Post-Dispatch Stats Validation

If stats capture is enabled: after all phases complete, validate the total entry count against the dispatch counter.

```bash
bash $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/validate-stats.sh "$STATS_FILE" <DISPATCH_COUNT>
```

If validate-stats.sh reports a mismatch, warn with the names of missing agents (not just the count delta). Example: "Stats capture: expected 22 entries but found 20. Missing agents: review--performance-oracle, readiness--plan-consolidator". Do not fail the command — this is a diagnostic warning only.

## Rules

- **NEVER delete prior run data.** Agent outputs, manifests, and synthesis files from ALL runs are retained for traceability and learning. Each run writes to `agents/run-<N>/` and `run-<N>-synthesis.md`.
- **NEVER call TaskOutput to retrieve full agent results.** Read the output files from disk instead.
- **NEVER paste full plan content into your own context if you can give agents the file path to read.**
- **Prefer re-running agents over skipping them.** When in doubt about whether an agent needs to run again, run it. The goal is the best possible output, not minimizing redundant work. Documents change between runs, and fresh analysis catches things prior runs missed.
- Agents write to disk. The parent reads summaries. The synthesis agent reads from disk.
- If context is getting heavy, compact before continuing. The manifest enables recovery.
- **Record the why, not just the what.** When the user resolves a red team finding, synthesis contradiction, or open question, capture their stated reasoning in the plan — not just the verdict. User rationale evaporates with conversation context; the plan is the only durable record.
- NEVER CODE. This command only researches and enhances plans.
