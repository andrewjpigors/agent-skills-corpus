name: omgb
description: Persistent Grok Build team-role orchestration for broad CLI tasks. Use when the user says omgb, asks for a thorough persistent run, or wants a team of roles to carry a task through intake, planning, execution, verification, review, fixes, and finalization. Loads roles by reading per-role files; spawns each role as a real Grok subagent rather than synthesizing them in a single context.

# OMGB - Oh My Grok Build Orchestrator

OMGB is the single entry point for persistent role-team orchestration in Grok
Build. It is one markdown skill. It does not require MCP servers, hooks,
custom commands, daemons, or additional skills.

The orchestration here stays simple by design. Role differentiation lives in
per-role files at `agents/<role>.md` (Grok-native agent prompt) and
`roles/<role>.toml` (Grok-native capability config). When you need role detail,
read that role's two files; do not duplicate role bodies inside this skill.

## Ground Rules

- Activate when the user invokes `/omgb`, says `OMGB`, asks for persistent team execution, or requests a thorough role-based run.
- Do not create or invoke additional custom skills as part of OMGB.
- Do not require MCP servers, hooks, background daemons, or hidden extension state.
- Use Grok's documented strengths: plan mode, headless `grok -p`, named sessions `-s`, `--resume`, `--check`, `--agent`, `--agents` JSON, and ordinary subagent spawning.
- Ask before destructive, irreversible, credential-gated, external-production, or materially scope-changing actions.
- Never auto-commit, push, deploy, publish, or delete user work unless explicitly requested.
- Keep one leader responsible for integration and final evidence.

## Official Grok Assumptions

The official docs checked for this plugin document:

- `/skills` and `/plugins` open the extensions modal inside Grok Build's TUI.
- User-invocable skills can appear as slash commands.
- Plan mode blocks write tools except the session plan file.
- Headless mode supports `grok -p`, `--cwd`, `-s`, `--resume`, `--continue`, `--output-format`, and `--check`.
- `--agent`, `--agents` JSON, and `--no-subagents` configure subagent spawning.
- Always-approve mode exists but should only run with explicit user consent.

The Grok client also bundles its own `roles/<name>.toml`, `agents/<name>.md`,
and `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` under `~/.grok/bundled/`. OMGB's role files match
that native layout so Grok can discover them through ordinary plugin payloads.

## Launcher Fan-Out (recommended path under Grok 0.1.x)

Grok 0.1.x's in-session leader does not reliably emit multiple
`spawn_subagent` calls in a single assistant turn. To produce an auditable
OMGB run today, use the **launcher-fanout** orchestration mode, which records
a deterministic `run_id` shared by `state.json`, `fanout-trace.json`, and each
role's evidence block:

```bash
# Single phase cohort (e.g. grounding: scout + researcher in parallel)
scripts/workflow/launch-omgb-fanout.sh <slug> "<task>" --launch

# Multi-phase pipeline (e.g. grounding then review)
scripts/workflow/launch-omgb-pipeline.sh <slug> "<task>" --launch
```

The launcher itself acts as the orchestrator and forks N parallel
`grok --agent <role>` subprocesses, one per role. Each subprocess is a
single-role headless grok session. The launcher records per-role timings and a
shared `run_id` in `<rundir>/fanout-trace.json`; the audit uses that `run_id`
identity as the blocking contract and reports timing gaps only as diagnostics.

The in-session leader path (`/omgb` skill loaded into one grok session)
remains the primary contract. When Grok's leader gains real single-turn
multi-tool-use, that path will work too. Fan-out is the bridge that lets
OMGB deliver on the parallel promise under current Grok.

## Mandatory Subagent Spawning (no synthesis)

**This section is load-bearing. Read it before activating any role.**

OMGB's "persistent role team" claim is only honest if each role actually runs
as its own Grok subagent. Earlier OMGB runs degraded into single-context
"synthesis" — the leader speaking for code-reviewer, security-reviewer, etc.
That is now a contract violation, not a fallback.

### The discipline

- Every role activation in any phase below (Grounding, Planning, Execution, Verification, Review, Fix Loop) MUST be a real Grok subagent invocation.
- The leader MUST NOT paraphrase, narrate, or "channel" another role.
- The leader MUST refuse to advance to Finalization while any role has been activated without a recorded subagent invocation, unless an explicit synthesis opt-in token is present in `mission.md`.

### How to spawn

Use one of these mechanisms, in order of preference:

1. **`grok --agents <JSON>` at session start** — the canonical path. The team launcher (`scripts/workflow/launch-omgb-team.sh`) emits the JSON for all 16 roles from disk. Grok then routes each `Task`-style instruction to the named subagent.
2. **`grok --agent <role-file>` per-task** — for headless single-role probes from within an active session.
3. **The Task tool inside the TUI** — when the host exposes it, the leader emits `Task(agent="<role>", prompt="…")` to spawn a worker. Record the Task call id in evidence.

### Required evidence per role activation

For every role the leader activates in this run, append to `evidence.md`:

```
## Subagent: <role> (task=<task-id>)

- spawn_method: agents-json | agent-flag | task-tool | unavailable
- invocation: <exact command, Task call id, or session id>
- phase: intake | grounding | planning | execution | verification | review | fix-loop | finalization
- cohort: <id, e.g. "g1"> | serial-by-design  (with `- serial_reason: ...` on the next line if serial-by-design)
- run_id: <deterministic id shared by state.json, fanout-trace.json, and every role in this cohort; launcher-fanout writes this automatically>
- started: <ISO-8601>
- completed: <ISO-8601>
- duration_ms: <completed - started, integer milliseconds>
- worker_output_excerpt: |
    ### WORKER START <role>
    <verbatim 5–30 lines from the subagent's reply>
    ### WORKER END <role>
- verdict_or_result: <one-line summary>
```

The worker output excerpt MUST come back inside the `### WORKER START <role>` /
`### WORKER END <role>` markers that every worker file requires. The leader
copies that block verbatim — no paraphrase.

**The audit treats timing as diagnostic and identity as the hard contract.**
For launcher-fanout runs, mandatory-parallel cohorts pass or fail on the
shared `run_id` recorded in `state.json.phases[]`, `fanout-trace.json`, and
each `evidence.md` role block. For Task-tool runs, Grok session `events.jsonl`
remains a transcript evidence source, but timing gaps are warnings unless
deterministic identity evidence is missing or inconsistent. The leader-recorded
`started:` / `completed:` / `duration_ms:` fields are descriptive.

### What to do when subagents are unavailable

If the host disables subagents (`--no-subagents`, missing `--agents` support,
no Task tool), the leader does **not** silently synthesize. Instead:

1. Add a blocker to `state.json.blockers`: `"subagent-spawn-unavailable"`.
2. Stop and ask the user to either:
   - Re-launch via `scripts/workflow/launch-omgb-team.sh <slug> "<task>" --launch` in an environment that supports `--agents`, or
   - Add `OMGB_ALLOW_SYNTHESIS: true` to `mission.md` to explicitly opt into single-context mode for this run. The synthesis opt-in is recorded for every activated role with `spawn_method: unavailable` plus a `Synthesis Justification:` line so the audit tool can flag it.
3. Do not mark `state.active=false` until the user resolves the choice.

### Audit gate

Before Finalization (Phase 7), the leader MUST run the audit:

```bash
node scripts/ci/validate.mjs --audit-run <task-slug>
```

The audit fails if any `activeRole` lacks a `## Subagent: <role>` block, or if
the block claims `spawn_method: unavailable` without a matching opt-in in
`mission.md`. The leader records the audit's exit code and output snippet in
`evidence.md` before advancing to Phase 7.

## Parallel Spawning (mandatory for independent lanes)

OMGB's "team" claim is only honest if independent roles actually run in
parallel. Serial spawning across an entire pipeline is a contract regression
that earlier runs (`omgb-smoke`, others) exhibited.

### The rule

When a phase activates two or more roles that do not depend on each other,
the leader MUST spawn them concurrently. Concrete mechanism: emit all
`spawn_subagent` (or `Task`) tool calls in a single assistant turn.

```
PARALLEL (correct)
  Turn N: <leader emits TWO tool calls in the same message>
    spawn_subagent(name="codebase-scout", prompt=...)
    spawn_subagent(name="researcher",    prompt=...)
  Turn N+1: <both worker replies arrive together; leader records both
            Subagent blocks under the same cohort id>

SERIAL (forbidden for independent roles)
  Turn N:   spawn_subagent(name="codebase-scout", ...)
  Turn N+1: <scout reply arrives>
  Turn N+2: spawn_subagent(name="researcher", ...)
  Turn N+3: <researcher reply arrives>
  → contract violation: scout and researcher were independent, leader serialized them.
```

### Mandatory-parallel cohorts

| Phase | Roles that MUST share one cohort | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Grounding | `codebase-scout` + `researcher` (when both activated) | They read independent sources (local repo vs official docs). No data dependency. |
| Review | every active reviewer (`code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, `performance-reviewer`, `ux-reviewer`) | Reviewers operate on the same changeset independently. |
| Execution | `executor` + `writer` (when docs follow code) when on disjoint files | Independent file sets. Use serial only when the writer needs the executor's output. |

### Evidence schema additions

Every `## Subagent: <role>` block grows two optional fields:

```
- phase:   intake | grounding | planning | execution | verification | review | fix-loop | finalization
- cohort:  <short id, e.g. "g1", "review-r1"> — roles spawned in the same launcher/turn share an id
- run_id:  <deterministic cohort id shared across state.json, fanout-trace.json, and evidence.md>
```

The audit (`node scripts/ci/validate.mjs --audit-run <slug>`) reads these.
For each mandatory-parallel launcher-fanout cohort (Grounding, Review), it
requires all participating roles to share one `cohort` and one deterministic
`run_id` across `state.json`, `fanout-trace.json`, and `evidence.md`. Timing
spreads are reported as diagnostics only; missing or mismatched identity is
the high-severity violation.

When two roles legitimately depend on each other (e.g., architect reads
planner output before producing its verdict), the leader records `cohort:
serial-by-design` plus a one-line `serial_reason:` field. The audit accepts
that.

## No-Stop-Between-Phases (mandatory)

The leader does NOT pause between phases or between role activations to
ask the user "should I continue?". The OMGB contract is end-to-end
autonomous up to Finalization.

### Stop only when

The leader stops and asks the user in exactly these cases:

1. A destructive, irreversible, credentialed, or external-production action is required (commit/push, deploy, rm -rf, history rewrite).
2. Execution (Phase 3) is about to begin: the leader presents the finalized plan plus any APR findings and waits for explicit user approval before writing any production code (the Phase 3 consent gate).
3. The user gave conflicting or missing requirements that the intake-analyst could not resolve (intake's blocking question).
4. `state.json.blockers` contains a real blocker that needs a human decision (e.g., missing credentials, contradictory acceptance criteria, subagent-spawn-unavailable without synthesis opt-in).
5. Three review rounds REQUEST CHANGES on the same item.
6. The same verification command fails three times.

### Never stop because

- A subagent finished its turn and "I should confirm the next step." Spawn the next role immediately.
- A phase boundary was crossed. Phase transitions are internal bookkeeping, not user checkpoints.
- The task list still has pending items. Pending items are work to do, not reasons to halt.
- The audit is about to run. The audit is the gate the leader uses; it is not a user prompt.

### Permission discipline

The launcher passes `--permission-mode auto` so individual read-only and
scoped-write tool calls do not pop confirmation prompts. The leader still
honors the "destructive action" rule above; it does not bypass user
consent for the truly risky operations. `auto` mode means "approve the
ordinary tool calls, escalate the risky ones."

## Persistent Run Directory

At the start of a non-trivial run, create or resume:

```text
.grok/omgb/runs/<task-slug>/
  mission.md
  state.json
  tasks.json
  evidence.md
  review.md
```

Use lowercase kebab-case for `<task-slug>`. Prefer short, ergonomic slugs
(`auth-audit`, `handoff-fix`, `perf-2026`) over long descriptive ones.
If an active run exists for the same slug, resume it instead of starting over.

`state.json` should contain:

```json
{
  "mode": "omgb",
  "active": true,
  "phase": "intake",
  "startedAt": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "taskSlug": "example-task",
  "activeRoles": [],
  "ambiguityScore": "low",
  "qaCycles": 0,
  "reviewRounds": 0,
  "blockers": [],
  "phases": [
    {"name": "intake",       "started": "ISO-8601", "completed": "ISO-8601", "duration_ms": 1234},
    {"name": "grounding",    "started": "ISO-8601", "completed": "ISO-8601", "duration_ms": 5678}
  ]
}
```

Append one entry to `state.json.phases` every time you transition out of a
phase. `duration_ms = Date.parse(completed) - Date.parse(started)`. The audit
sanity-checks the array exists when `phase` is `complete`.

`ambiguityScore` is one of `"low"`, `"medium"`, or `"high"`, mirrored from the
intake-analyst's `## Ambiguity` section in `mission.md`. The leader records it
at the end of Phase 0. The audit parses `mission.md`'s ambiguity section and
reports the score; when the score is `high` and the blocking question is still
unresolved, the audit emits an `ADVISORY` line (not a hard failure) so the
leader surfaces the residual ambiguity rather than silently proceeding.

`tasks.json` should contain role-owned tasks:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "T-001",
      "title": "Map repository commands",
      "ownerRole": "codebase-scout",
      "status": "pending",
      "acceptance": ["Exact verification commands are recorded in evidence.md"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Durable Event Ledger (advanced, optional)

For long or resumable runs, the leader MAY maintain an append-only durable
ledger at `.grok/omgb/runs/<task-slug>/events.jsonl`. Each line is one JSON
event:

```json
{"timestamp": "ISO-8601", "phase": "execution", "action": "spawn:executor", "activeRoles": ["executor"], "blockers": []}
```

Rules:

- Append-only: never rewrite or truncate. One JSON object per line (JSONL).
- Each event records `timestamp`, `phase`, `action`, the `activeRoles` array,
  and the current `blockers` array at that moment.
- The ledger is OPTIONAL. It is a complementary consistency source: the audit
  (`scripts/ci/check-subagent-evidence.mjs`) reads it when present, reports the
  event count, and emits an `ADVISORY` only if a line is malformed JSON. The
  ledger never causes a hard audit failure on its own.

This is an advanced feature for durability across compaction, resume, and
machine swaps. Runs that do not need it omit the file entirely.

## Role Catalog

When role detail is needed, load `agents/ROLE-INDEX.md` for the index, then
spawn the specific role as a subagent and read its files at:

| Role | Agent file | Capability config |
| --- | --- | --- |
| leader | `agents/leader.md` | `roles/leader.toml` |
| intake-analyst | `agents/intake-analyst.md` | `roles/intake-analyst.toml` |
| researcher | `agents/researcher.md` | `roles/researcher.toml` |
| codebase-scout | `agents/codebase-scout.md` | `roles/codebase-scout.toml` |
| planner | `agents/planner.md` | `roles/planner.toml` |
| architect | `agents/architect.md` | `roles/architect.toml` |
| executor | `agents/executor.md` | `roles/executor.toml` |
| debugger | `agents/debugger.md` | `roles/debugger.toml` |
| test-engineer | `agents/test-engineer.md` | `roles/test-engineer.toml` |
| verifier | `agents/verifier.md` | `roles/verifier.toml` |
| code-reviewer | `agents/code-reviewer.md` | `roles/code-reviewer.toml` |
| security-reviewer | `agents/security-reviewer.md` | `roles/security-reviewer.toml` |
| performance-reviewer | `agents/performance-reviewer.md` | `roles/performance-reviewer.toml` |
| writer | `agents/writer.md` | `roles/writer.toml` |
| git-steward | `agents/git-steward.md` | `roles/git-steward.toml` |
| ux-reviewer | `agents/ux-reviewer.md` | `roles/ux-reviewer.toml` |

Only activate the roles a task actually needs. Workers do not recursively
orchestrate. Workers report to the leader.

## Role Router

Route by task shape:

| Task Shape | First Roles | Required Before Final |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vague or broad request | intake-analyst, codebase-scout | planner, verifier |
| New feature | codebase-scout, planner, architect | executor, test-engineer, code-reviewer, verifier |
| Bug or failing test | codebase-scout, debugger | executor, test-engineer, verifier |
| Refactor or cleanup | codebase-scout, planner, architect | executor, test-engineer, code-reviewer, verifier |
| External API, package, or policy | researcher, codebase-scout, architect | executor, test-engineer, security-reviewer, verifier |
| Documentation | researcher, codebase-scout, writer | verifier |
| UI or UX | ux-reviewer, codebase-scout | executor, test-engineer, verifier |
| Merge, conflict, release, commit, PR | git-steward, codebase-scout | test-engineer, verifier |
| Security-sensitive work | security-reviewer, architect | test-engineer, verifier, code-reviewer |
| Performance work | performance-reviewer, codebase-scout | test-engineer, verifier |

When the task spans independent lanes, run available subagents in parallel via
Grok's native subagent spawning (`--agents` JSON or the Task tool). Each
spawn is logged per the Mandatory Subagent Spawning section above.

## Phase Pipeline

Every phase below that activates roles requires a real subagent spawn per role
plus its evidence block. The leader checks the audit gate before advancing.

### Phase 0: Intake and Resume

1. Identify the task slug and run directory.
2. Resume existing `state.json` when present and active.
3. Spawn the `intake-analyst` subagent to extract user goal, constraints, non-goals, and acceptance criteria into `mission.md`.
4. If ambiguity is high, ask exactly one blocking question. Otherwise proceed.

Advance when:

- `mission.md` has a goal, scope, non-goals, constraints, and acceptance criteria.
- A `## Subagent: intake-analyst` evidence block exists.
- `state.json.phase` is `grounding`.

### Phase 1: Grounding and Research

**Parallel cohort required.** When both `codebase-scout` and `researcher`
are activated, the leader spawns them in the SAME assistant turn (one
`cohort` id, two `spawn_subagent` calls in one message).

1. Spawn `codebase-scout` (maps local files, commands, package manager, tests, likely edit surfaces) and `researcher` (current official docs, plugin policy, SDK/API behavior, package versions) **in one parallel cohort**.
2. Each subagent's verbatim output goes into `evidence.md` inside its `## Subagent: <role>` block with `phase: grounding` and the shared `cohort:` id.
3. Mark unsupported or inferred behavior explicitly.

Advance when:

- The leader can name likely files to change.
- External policy or API assumptions are sourced or marked as unknown.
- Subagent evidence blocks exist for every role activated in this phase.

### Phase 2: Planning and Staffing

1. Spawn `planner` to create tasks in `tasks.json`.
2. Spawn `architect` when design risk is real.
3. Assign owners from the role catalog.
4. Define verification commands before editing.
5. If the user asked only for a plan, stop after this phase and mark `state.active` false.

Advance when:

- Every task has an owner role, status, and acceptance criteria.
- The plan names verification commands.
- Subagent evidence blocks exist for every role activated in this phase.

### Phase 2.5: Adversarial Plan Review (optional gate)

Triggered when the user uses any of these keywords in their task — `rigorously`, `strictly`, `deeply`, `adversarial`, `debate`, `hostile review`, `apr` — OR when the launcher is invoked with `--apr`. Otherwise skipped.

This is OMGB's plan-hardening gate. Five review-eligible roles are spawned in a single parallel cohort, each playing a hostile defender of its domain. They attack the plan produced in Phase 2 from independent angles. The leader then distills the surviving objections back into `tasks.json` BEFORE Phase 3 starts. No code is written until the plan has survived the gauntlet.

**The 5 adversarial defenders** (all already exist in OMGB; all read-only by capability):

| Role | Domain attacked | Stance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `code-reviewer` | Correctness, contract drift, partial implementations | "Where will this break? Cite file:line." |
| `security-reviewer` | Blast radius, auth/secret/input boundaries, supply chain | "What is the trust boundary? What if the input is hostile?" |
| `performance-reviewer` | Hot paths, allocations, cold-start, scaling assumptions | "What happens at 10x scale? Where is the unmeasured assumption?" |
| `ux-reviewer` | User intent vs literal request, install/CLI flow regressions | "Is this solving the literal ask or the underlying need?" |
| `architect` | Coupling, leaky abstractions, structural debt, simpler alternatives | "Is there a simpler design that meets the requirements?" |

**Execution**:

1. The leader spawns the 5 roles in ONE parallel cohort (`cohort: apr-r1`, `phase: planning`). Each receives the full `tasks.json` plus `mission.md` and is instructed:
   - Produce 3–7 numbered findings, each ≤3 sentences, each tied to a SPECIFIC task id or plan section.
   - Required posture is HOSTILE: weak findings are rejected; pride is the enemy.
   - Each finding declares one of: `CONSTRAINT` (the plan must respect this), `RISK` (mitigation required), `ALTERNATIVE` (consider this reframing), or `BLOCKER` (the plan cannot proceed until resolved).
   - Verdict: `APPROVE` (no blocking findings), `REQUEST CHANGES` (findings must be addressed), `BLOCK` (re-plan required).
2. Each reviewer's verdict and findings go into `review.md` under a `## APR Round <n>` header and into the standard `## Subagent: <role>` evidence block.
3. The leader distills survivors into `tasks.json`:
   - Every `CONSTRAINT` becomes a non-negotiable acceptance criterion on the relevant task.
   - Every `RISK` becomes either a new task ("mitigation: …") OR an explicit acceptance criterion.
   - Every `BLOCKER` halts Phase 3 until resolved or the user explicitly waives it in `mission.md`.
   - Every `ALTERNATIVE` is recorded in `mission.md` under `## Considered Alternatives` with a one-line accept-or-reject rationale.
4. The leader records the distillation count in `state.json` under `aprRounds` and proceeds to Phase 3 only when no `BLOCK` verdict remains unresolved.

**Anti-patterns** (audited):

- Synthesizing the 5 verdicts in one context. Each verdict MUST come from a real subagent spawn (same rule as Phase 5 Review).
- Softening the hostile prompt. The adversarial posture IS the mechanism.
- Including conceded findings in the distillation. Only survivors enter `tasks.json`.
- Running APR from a worker. APR is leader-only; workers do not orchestrate it.

If the trigger keywords are absent and the launcher did not request APR, the leader skips this phase silently (no evidence overhead).

### Phase 3: Execution

**Consent gate (mandatory before any code is written).** Before spawning the
first executor, the leader presents the finalized plan to the user and waits
for explicit approval:

1. Present the finalized `tasks.json` plan (task ids, owners, scenarios) plus any
   APR findings from Phase 2.5 (`CONSTRAINT` / `RISK` / `ALTERNATIVE` / `BLOCKER`
   distillations) in a concise summary.
2. Ask for explicit approval to begin Execution. Wait for a clear "yes / approved
   / proceed" from the user before any production file is touched.
3. Do not start Execution on silence, on an ambiguous reply, or by inferring
   consent from the original request. If the user requests changes, return to
   Phase 2 / Phase 2.5 and re-present.

This gate is consistent with the "ask before destructive actions" rule: writing
or mutating production code is the first irreversible step of the run, so the
user owns the go/no-go decision. It is the one user checkpoint that the
otherwise-autonomous No-Stop-Between-Phases contract preserves before Execution.

1. Spawn `executor` to implement scoped tasks.
2. Spawn `debugger` for failures and failing tests.
3. Spawn `writer` when docs need updates.
4. The leader updates `tasks.json` after each completed task.
5. No worker may reduce scope to make tests pass.
6. **Execution Discipline applies** (see section below). TDD-mandatory + scenario contract + durable notepad + reviewer gate are binding for every production change in this phase.

Advance when:

- All planned implementation tasks are complete or explicitly cancelled by the user.
- Changed files and rationale are recorded in `evidence.md`.
- Subagent evidence blocks exist for every role activated in this phase.

### Phase 4: Verification

1. Spawn `test-engineer` to run focused checks first.
2. Run the project-level verification suite available for the changed surface: build, lint, typecheck, tests, smoke, and sanity.
3. Record exact commands and important output snippets in `evidence.md` inside the test-engineer's subagent block.
4. Increment `qaCycles` in `state.json`.

If verification fails, enter Phase 6. Stop and surface a blocker if the same
failure recurs three times.

Advance when:

- Every acceptance criterion has fresh evidence.
- No relevant verification command is failing.
- A `## Subagent: test-engineer` block exists for this cycle.

### Phase 5: Review

**Parallel cohort required.** All active reviewers run in one cohort,
spawned in a single assistant turn. Reviewers operate on the same
changeset independently and never block each other.

1. In one assistant turn, spawn every applicable reviewer concurrently:
   - `code-reviewer` (always)
   - `security-reviewer` (when changes touch auth, secrets, untrusted input, shell execution, dependency manifests, network calls, or file paths)
   - `performance-reviewer` (for performance claims or hot-path changes)
   - `ux-reviewer` (for CLI prompts, install flows, or final report shape)
2. Each reviewer's verbatim verdict goes into `review.md`, and the corresponding `## Subagent: <reviewer>` block in `evidence.md` carries `phase: review` plus the shared `cohort:` id.
3. Increment `reviewRounds` in `state.json` after the cohort returns.

Verdicts:

- `APPROVE`: no blocking findings.
- `COMMENT`: non-blocking risks remain.
- `REQUEST CHANGES`: fix required before finalization.

If any review requests changes, enter Phase 6. Stop and surface a blocker
after three review rounds on the same issue. **The leader is not allowed to
sign reviewer verdicts. Every verdict in `review.md` MUST come from a real
spawn whose evidence block is in `evidence.md`.**

### Phase 6: Fix Loop

1. Convert each failing verification or review finding into a task in `tasks.json`.
2. Route to `debugger`, `executor`, `test-engineer`, or the relevant reviewer.
3. Return to Phase 3 or Phase 4 depending on whether code changed.
4. Do not skip re-verification after fixes.

### Phase 7: Finalization

1. Ensure every task is `completed`, `cancelled`, or `blocked` with explanation.
2. Ensure `evidence.md` contains fresh verification output.
3. Ensure `review.md` has final verdicts from real reviewer spawns.
4. Run `node scripts/ci/validate.mjs --audit-run <task-slug>` and record the result. If it fails, do not finalize.
5. Set `state.active` false and `phase: "complete"` only when verified.
6. Report changed files, commands run, review verdicts, residual risks, and next optional actions.

## Execution Discipline (TDD + Scenarios + Notepad + Reviewer Gate)

Binding rules for Phase 3 (Execution), Phase 4 (Verification), and Phase 5 (Review). Each rule encodes a distinct binding contract — not narrative reinforcement.

### TDD Mandatory (RED → GREEN → SURFACE)

Every production change in this run follows this sequence:

1. **RED**: `test-engineer` writes a failing test that exercises the target behavior. The leader captures the failing assertion message verbatim in the test-engineer's evidence block before any production code is touched.
2. **GREEN**: `executor` makes the smallest change that flips the test green. The leader captures the new assertion (or `0 failing`) line.
3. **SURFACE**: `verifier` exercises the real surface — CLI stdout, exit code, file diff, generated artifact, browser/Playwright output when available — and captures the artifact in `evidence.md`. Tests are the floor; the surface artifact is the ceiling. Asserting "tests pass" alone is NOT sufficient evidence.

**Exemption whitelist** (only these are exempt from RED→GREEN; each must be justified in writing inside the executor's evidence block, one line max):

- formatting-only
- comment-only
- version bump
- rename-only (no behavior change)

Unjustified exemption = the verifier MUST reject the change in Phase 4 and the leader returns to Phase 3.

Parallelism rule: RED and GREEN of the SAME scenario MUST be serial within the same scenario. Independent scenarios may proceed in parallel cohorts.

### Scenario Contract (binding)

Before any code is touched in Phase 3, the planner (or, if planner already ran, the executor's first turn) declares 3 or more scenarios in `tasks.json` under each task's `scenarios` array. Each scenario MUST specify:

- `id` — short stable id (`S1`, `S2`, …).
- `class` — exactly one of: `happy`, `edge` (boundary / empty / malformed / concurrent), `regression` (adjacent surface still works).
- `pass_condition` — a BINARY observable. "returns 200 and body matches schema X" is acceptable; "should work" is not.
- `surface_artifact` — the concrete evidence source that proves it (e.g., `grok -p output`, `curl status+body`, `node script stdout`, `test exit code 0`, `diff of file X`).
- `test_file_and_id` — the automated test file path plus test id that exercises this scenario, written test-first.

Coverage rule: the 3+ scenarios MUST include at least one `happy`, one `edge`, and one `regression`. The verifier rejects the task if any of the three classes is missing.

### Durable Notepad

At Phase 3 start, the leader creates `.grok/omgb/runs/<task-slug>/notepad.md` with these sections initialized empty and only ever appended to (never rewritten):

```text
# OMGB Notepad — <one-line goal>
Started: <ISO-8601 timestamp>

## Plan (atomic steps, ordered)
## Scenarios (the contract — copy of tasks.json scenarios)
## Now (single step in progress)
## Todo (remaining, ordered)
## Findings (non-obvious facts with file:line refs)
## Learnings (patterns / pitfalls for next turn)
```

The notepad is the leader's durable memory across turns and across resume. If the leader loses context (compaction, resume from another machine, model swap), the recovery action is: re-read the notepad, then continue. Workers do NOT write to the notepad — only the leader appends.

TODO format inside the notepad uses this binding shape: `<path>: <action> for <scenario-id> — verify by <check>`. This encodes WHERE / WHY (which scenario it advances) / VERIFY. Exactly ONE step is `in_progress` at a time. The leader marks it `completed` immediately on finish — never batched.

- GOOD pair: `src/foo.test.ts: write failing test for S2 — verify by RED with assertion msg` → `src/foo.ts: implement validator for S2 — verify by foo.test.ts GREEN + CLI exit 0`
- BAD: "implement feature", "fix bug", "add tests later", or production code before its failing test → rewrite.

### Reviewer Gate (binding)

Phase 5 Review verdicts are BINDING, not advisory. The leader does not interpret them.

- `APPROVE` = no blocking findings. The leader may advance to Phase 7.
- `COMMENT` = non-blocking risks. Recorded in `review.md` but Phase 7 may proceed.
- `REQUEST CHANGES` = blocking. Phase 7 is gated until Phase 6 + re-review.
- `"looks good but…"` or any hedged approval = REQUEST CHANGES. Hedged approvals are rejection by contract; the leader does NOT round them up to APPROVE.

Reviewer-gate trigger expansion: the gate fires automatically (not just when keywords appear) when ANY of the following are true:

- The task touched 3 or more files.
- The task ran 20 or more leader turns.
- The task's category is `refactor`, `migration`, `performance`, `security`, or `release`.
- The user used any of the trigger keywords (`rigorously`, `strictly`, `deeply`, `carefully`).

Loop until at least one reviewer issues `APPROVE` unconditionally. Stop and surface a blocker after three review rounds on the same item (already documented in Phase 5).

## Headless and Resume Hints

When invoking Grok from a shell for an OMGB run, prefer a named session with
the full team JSON:

```bash
scripts/workflow/launch-omgb-team.sh <short-slug> "<task>" --launch
```

That command writes the agents JSON, runs the validator, and invokes:

```bash
grok -s "omgb-<short-slug>" --cwd "$PWD" -p "/omgb <task>" \
  --agents "@.grok/omgb/runs/<short-slug>/agents-config.json"
```

For continuation:

```bash
grok --resume "omgb-<short-slug>"
```

Use `--output-format json` or `--output-format streaming-json` only when an
automation caller needs machine-readable progress. Use `--always-approve`
only when the user explicitly accepts permission risk. Use `--check` to
append a self-verification loop in headless mode.

## Smoke and Sanity Contract

For plugin development, the leader must run:

```bash
node scripts/ci/validate.mjs --smoke
node scripts/ci/validate.mjs --sanity
node scripts/ci/validate.mjs --audit-run <task-slug>
npm test
```

Expected success markers:

- `[OMGB] smoke passed`
- `[OMGB] sanity passed`
- `[OMGB] audit passed` (or `[OMGB] audit blocked` with actionable diagnostics)

For end-to-end validation against the user's existing Grok login:

```bash
OMGB_E2E_HEADLESS=1 scripts/local/e2e.sh
```

Expected success marker:

- `[OMGB] e2e passed`

For structural validation without the live model probe, use `OMGB_E2E_ALLOW_HEADLESS_SKIP=1 scripts/local/e2e.sh` and expect `[OMGB] structural e2e passed`.

The E2E script reuses `~/.grok/auth.json`; it must not invoke `grok login`.

### Environment variables

| Env var | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OMGB_E2E_HEADLESS` | unset | Set to `1` to enable the live model probe in `scripts/local/e2e.sh`. |
| `OMGB_E2E_ALLOW_HEADLESS_SKIP` | unset | Set to `1` to allow `e2e.sh` to pass without a live Grok login (structural check only). |
| `OMGB_ALLOW_SYNTHESIS` | unset | Set `OMGB_ALLOW_SYNTHESIS: true` in a run's `mission.md` to allow single-context synthesis fallback. |
| `OMGB_SUBAGENT_STALL_MS` | `600000` | Per-subagent duration threshold (ms) for stall warnings in `--audit-run` / `--audit-all`. WARN-only; does not change exit code. |

## Final Report Format

Use this concise report shape:

```text
OMGB RESULT
Task: <goal>
Run: .grok/omgb/runs/<slug>
Phase: complete | blocked | cancelled
Spawned roles: <comma-separated, each with a Subagent block in evidence.md>
Changed files: <paths>
Verification: <commands and pass/fail>
Audit: [OMGB] audit passed | [OMGB] audit blocked
Review: <APPROVE|COMMENT|REQUEST CHANGES>
Risks: <remaining risks or none>
```
