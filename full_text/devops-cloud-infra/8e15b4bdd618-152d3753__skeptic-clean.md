description: Skeptic auditable data cleaning. Use after formulate and protocol to build an auditable cleaning pipeline under protocol-defined data visibility, without widening the claim boundary or assuming predictive workflow defaults. Third stage of Skeptic. Use when Codex should run the Skeptic clean stage as a standalone skill, including requests like skeptic clean --auto to run this stage with autonomous cycle execution.
---


## Codex Invocation

Use this skill for `skeptic clean`. If the user writes `skeptic clean --auto`, run all cycles for the `clean` stage without asking cycle-by-cycle questions; make autonomous pass/iterate decisions from the stage acceptance criteria and stop only for missing required inputs, blocking environment failures, or user-owned choices that cannot be inferred.

# /skeptic:clean - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

IMPORTANT: Before executing, read `references/core-principles.md`. `core-principles.md` is the architecture contract. If this file conflicts with it, `core-principles.md` wins.

## Guiding Principle

Cleaning produces an auditable, reproducible data pipeline that preserves measurement meaning and supports the approved question inside the approved protocol. Fix structural and value problems, make semantic contracts explicit, document judgment calls, preserve or clarify the analyzable population, and prepare trustworthy inputs for later stages. When convenience conflicts with meaning, choose meaning.

Route files may narrow or prohibit cleaning, preprocessing, or derived-variable actions. They may not widen this stage-core, the approved formulation, or the protocol contract.

## Stage Outputs

`clean` writes exactly three project-side artifacts plus a README block. The stage script grows two reusable helpers (`clean_data` and `preprocess_data`) during Cycle R. Constraint specs and cleaned outputs are optional companions.

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `{scripts_dir_name}/03_cleaning.py` | Single Python file. One `run_cycle_*` function per cycle, plus `clean_data(...)` and `preprocess_data(...)` helpers added during Cycle R. Invoked one cycle at a time: `python 03_cleaning.py --cycle X`. Returns a JSON evidence packet on stdout. |
| `{docs_dir_name}/03_cleaning.yaml` | Canonical stage memory. Data contract, visibility set, cleaning and preprocessing decisions, row-count reconciliation, dataset fitness reviews, reproducibility and robustness outputs, cycle history, and PCS review. Created at stage start, updated at the end of every cycle. |
| `{docs_dir_name}/03_cleaning.md` | Human-readable report. Rendered once at finalization from the canonical YAML. |
| `{readme_name}` | Short `## Clean [COMPLETE]` block added at finalization. |

Optional companion artifacts (written during Cycle R or beyond):

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `{scripts_dir_name}/clean_constraints.json` | Declared and derived constraints produced by `clean_data`. Declared constraints are normative; derived constraints are informational unless explicitly promoted. |
| `{scripts_dir_name}/preprocess_constraints.json` | Declared and derived constraints produced by `preprocess_data` when Cycle E or F ran. Otherwise an explicit no-additional-constraints file. |
| `{data_dir_name}/silver/` | Cleaned outputs when they differ from raw inputs. Each artifact has a documented schema and known limitations. |

The canonical YAML is the single source of truth. If the rendered markdown disagrees with the YAML, the YAML wins.

## Required Inputs

| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Project folder path | Path to an existing project under the configured `projects_root` with completed `formulate` and `protocol` stages |

`clean` reads:

- `{docs_dir_name}/01_formulation.yaml` and `01_formulation.md` -- approved question, question type, target quantity, claim boundary, operationalization, unit of analysis, key assumptions, protocol handoff
- `{docs_dir_name}/02_protocol.yaml` and `02_protocol.md` -- active route, data usage mode, visibility rules, frozen artifacts, leakage rules, forbidden variable classes, clean prohibitions, validation logic, backtracking triggers
- Raw files under `{data_dir_name}/`
- Protocol-defined artifacts under `{data_dir_name}/` or a path named in `02_protocol.yaml`
- `{readme_name}` -- confirms prior stage completion

If upstream outputs are incomplete, contradictory, or missing required restrictions, stop and repair the upstream stage rather than inventing cleaning permissions around the gap.

## Canonical YAML Schema

`03_cleaning.yaml` is the stage's memory. The model initializes it in Cycle A and extends it at the end of every cycle. The script never writes to this file.

Write only fields that apply to the project. Omit fields that would be null; readers treat a missing key as "not applicable." The schema below names every possible field; a concrete project will populate a subset.

```yaml
stage: clean
schema_version: 3

pcs_review: null                    # set at stage close
```

Each `decision_ledger` entry:

```yaml
- cycle:                            # cycle letter or follow-up id
  iteration:                        # 1-based per cycle id
  decision:                         # pass|iterate|acknowledge_gap|reopen_*|data_insufficient|archive|override
  blocking_failures:                # int (0 = PASS, >0 = FAIL)
  blocking_reason:                  # one-line reason when blocking_failures > 0, else null
  evidence_summary: {}              # compact material evidence only; no full JSON, DataFrames, arrays, or per-column schema dumps
  changed_fields: []                # canonical-YAML fields written or materially changed this iteration
  next_action:                      # next cycle, follow-up, finalization, or backtrack target
  # Optional: user_observations, decision_reason, override: {reason, criterion}, material_sources: [{url, claim}], rejected_alternatives: [{option, reason}]
```

Analytical findings belong in their destination fields. The decision ledger records only what changed, why the cycle did or did not close, and what happens next. Do not store full subagent replies, criterion-by-criterion PASS notes, or repeated script output in canonical YAML.
`pcs_review` when set:

```yaml
pcs_review:
  overall:                          # PASS|FAIL, satisfied|valid_concern|disagree_override, or route-specific terminal verdict
  blocking_findings: []             # compact list of failed checks or blocking concerns
  material_risks: []                # compact list of non-blocking risks worth carrying forward
  material_findings: []             # compact list of review findings that changed a decision or disposition
  full_review_pointer:              # optional; use only when a FAIL or override requires retaining full text outside the canonical YAML
  disposition:                      # satisfied|valid_concern|disagree_override
  disposition_reason:
```

Rules:
- The YAML must parse with a standard YAML loader after every write.
- `decision_ledger` is append-only. Superseded iterations stay in the list; new iterations append.
- `claim_boundary_updates.narrowing_log` is appended only while `clean` is still open.
- Write only fields that apply.
- Use only ASCII characters in generated YAML content. Replace em dashes with `--`, curly quotes with straight quotes. Source-data strings may keep non-ASCII when the encoding is declared.

## Cycle Structure

| Cycle | Focus | Mandatory |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| A | Structural audit | Yes |
| B | Integrity diagnostics | Yes |
| C | Cleaning resolution | Yes |
| D1, D2, ... | Cleaning follow-ups | Conditional |
| E | Preprocessing | Retired - useful checks folded into Cycle C closeout |
| F | Derived variables and related downstream-safe transforms | Conditional |
| G1, G2, ... | Preprocessing and derived-variable follow-ups | Conditional |
| R | Reproducibility | Yes |
| S | Stability and transfer diagnostics | Yes |

Cycle F runs only when derived variables or similarly downstream-safe transformations are justified by the approved question and protocol. Skipping F must be recorded in `status.skipped_cycles`. Cycle C closeout, F, and G+ may force a new D-series follow-up if a representation decision turns out to be an unresolved cleaning issue. Cycle E is retired; do not open it for new projects.

## Per-cycle Reference Files

Before running cycle X, load only `cycles/{X}.yaml`. Each cycle YAML carries:

- `upstream`: canonical-YAML fields that must be set before the cycle starts
- `setup_side_effects`: one-time actions the cycle performs in Step 1 (Cycle A initializes the stage; Cycle R and S extend the script with helpers); omit when empty
- `required_evidence`: evidence keys or judgment outputs the cycle must produce
- `acceptance_criteria`: 3-5 verifiable conditions for cycle closure
- `writes`: mapping from evidence or judgment outputs to canonical-YAML fields
- `research_questions`: topics for the research subagent
- `guidance`: short, cycle-specific judgment rules
- decision-relevance check: for material judgments, name the plausible alternative most likely to change a downstream decision and store it in the relevant analytical field, not a new log
- `step4_additions`, `pcs_focus`, `log_extension`: present only when the cycle adds a specific discipline. `pcs_focus` holds cycle-specific PCS questions injected into the evaluation subagent prompt; it has no separate Step 5 application.

The stage entry (this file) is read once at stage start. Per-cycle files are loaded one at a time as each cycle runs.

Follow-up cycles use `cycles/D_template.yaml` (cleaning follow-ups) or `cycles/G_template.yaml` (preprocessing and derived-variable follow-ups) as a starting shape. Materialize the concrete Dn or Gn spec inside the canonical YAML (not as a new file on disk) when a follow-up is opened. Every follow-up must define at least one required evidence item and one acceptance criterion with the enforceable exit condition.

## Cycle Protocol

This protocol applies to every cycle, mandatory or follow-up.

### Step 1: Setup and Execution

1. Read `cycles/{cycle}.yaml`.
2. Recover prior stage state:
   - Cycle A: no prior `03_cleaning.yaml` exists yet.
   - First cycle entered in a fresh session (not Cycle A), or first cycle after a backtrack reopens the stage: read `03_cleaning.yaml` once to load the data contract, visibility set, cleaning and preprocessing decisions, and prior `decision_ledger`. Also reread `01_formulation.yaml` and `02_protocol.yaml` for upstream facts.
   - Every other case (continuing the same chat session): skip the re-read; the canonical YAML content is already in context.
3. Cycle A only:
   - Resolve the active route from `01_formulation.yaml` plus `02_protocol.yaml`. If they contradict, or do not collapse to one route for `clean`, stop and reopen `protocol`.
   - Load `references/routes/{route}.md` once and keep it in memory for the rest of the stage. If the expected route file is missing, stop and reopen upstream.
   - Run the precondition check: verify `01_formulation.yaml`, `02_protocol.yaml`, `{readme_name}`, at least one raw file, and every protocol-required artifact exist. Recompute SHA-256 for each raw file and compare to `provenance.files.{filename}.sha256` in `01_formulation.yaml`. Any mismatch is a blocking defect; stop until raw data is restored or formulate is reopened.
   - Verify `01_formulation.yaml` carries an approved question, question type, target quantity, claim boundary, unit of analysis, operationalization, and key assumptions. Verify `02_protocol.yaml` carries question type, active route, data usage mode, visibility rules, frozen-artifact status, leakage rules, forbidden variable classes, clean prohibitions, validation logic, and backtracking triggers. Missing or contradictory fields block the stage.
   - Derive the active visibility set from protocol and record it under `visibility_ref` as a protocol pointer plus compact execution summary: visible raw files, visible protocol artifacts, restricted artifacts, access levels.
   - Initialize `03_cleaning.yaml` with `stage`, `schema_version`, `project` (including `project.started_at`), `status.current_cycle: A`, `route`, `upstream_refs`, `upstream_contract`, `precondition_check`, and `visibility_ref`. Seed `question_critical_variables` from `contract.operationalization` in `01_formulation.yaml`.
   - Create `03_cleaning.py` with the shape specified below.
4. Every cycle after A: confirm the route context still resolves to the same route. If the route context becomes ambiguous, reread `01_formulation.yaml`, `02_protocol.yaml`, and the same route file before proceeding. Identify which visible artifacts the current cycle is allowed to inspect; if unclear, stop and reopen `protocol`.
5. Every cycle: extend `03_cleaning.py` by writing or updating the cycle's function (`run_cycle_a`, `run_cycle_b`, ...). The function must produce every required evidence key named by the cycle spec.
6. Run `python {scripts_dir_name}/03_cleaning.py --cycle {cycle}`. Capture stdout.
7. Parse stdout as JSON. Use the parsed dict as this cycle's candidate evidence for Step 2 and Step 3; Step 5 records a compact summary in `decision_ledger[*].script_evidence`. Do not retain raw stdout by default. Write a debug sidecar only when the cycle fails, is rerun for diagnosis, or the user asks for retained raw evidence.
8. Scan stderr and stdout for unhandled exceptions. Any unhandled exception is a blocking defect and must be fixed before continuing. Functions that intentionally demonstrate failure must be explicitly flagged with a `# expected_failure` comment.

Script contract: generate `03_cleaning.py` for the current project and follow `references/script-contract.md`. Include only the helpers needed for the visible artifacts and active cycle evidence. Cycle R adds `clean_data(...)`, `preprocess_data(...)`, and the reproducibility validator; Cycle S adds stability or transfer diagnostics only when required.

Script rules:
- The script prints exactly one JSON object to stdout. Nothing else on stdout.
- The script does not write to `03_cleaning.yaml`. Only the model writes the canonical YAML.
- The script respects protocol visibility and never loads restricted artifacts.
- Constraint verifiers use `verify_allowed_values(series, allowed, nullable)` or equivalent logic with `bad = ser[ser.notna() & ~ser.isin(allowed)]`; nullability is checked separately.
- Heavy data (arrays, full DataFrames) is summarized, not dumped. Evidence packets stay compact.
- Per-file provenance (schema, encoding, sha256) is emitted only the first time a file is recorded -- typically Cycle A iter 1. After it lands in `provenance.files`, neither the stdout packet nor `decision_ledger[*].script_evidence` re-emits those fields; downstream cycles reference those files by filename.
- Seeds are set inside the function whenever stochastic steps run, and the seed is echoed into the evidence packet.
- Stable helper functions or sibling helper modules are allowed when they reduce duplication and improve reproducibility. Helpers must be deterministic, documented briefly, and must not write canonical YAML or access restricted artifacts.

### Step 2: Human Review

Interactive mode:
1. Present the script evidence inline, concisely.
2. Scan the evidence for ambiguities, decision points the model cannot resolve alone, and research topics worth seeding into Step 3 beyond the cycle's default `research_questions`. Cleaning decisions often turn on user judgment (missingness policy, duplicate classification, population scope), so expect ambiguities in Cycles B, C, and any D-series follow-ups.
3. If at least one such item exists, dispatch `AskUserQuestion` with 1-3 questions targeting them. Otherwise proceed directly to Step 3.
4. When AskUserQuestion was dispatched, record the user's answers as `user_observations` in the pending decision_ledger entry. Pass them into Step 3 subagent prompts via the `User observations:` field.

Auto mode: apply the self-review loop from `the `--auto` rule in this SKILL.md`. Self-correct within the configured budget, then proceed unless an escalation trigger fires.

### Step 3: Subagent Review

Run subagents only when the cycle risk warrants it. Use the research subagent only when outside domain or methodological information can materially change a decision. Use the evaluation subagent on high-risk cycles, unresolved blocking issues, or stage close; otherwise perform the acceptance-criteria check inline.

Research subagent:

```text
Agent(
  model="{subagent_model}",
  description="Domain research for Clean Cycle {X}: {focus}",
  run_in_background=true,
  prompt="""
  You are a domain research assistant for a Skeptic clean cycle.

  Context:
  - Approved question: "{approved_question}"
  - Question type: {question_type}
  - Target quantity: {target_quantity}
  - Claim boundary: {claim_boundary}
  - Protocol mode: {data_usage_mode}
  - Clean-stage visibility rules: {visibility_summary}
  - Visible artifacts used in this cycle: {artifact_list}
  - Question-critical variables: {question_critical_variables}
  - Current cycle findings: {compact summary of script_evidence for this cycle}

  User observations: {decision_ledger entry's user_observations from Step 2, or "none"}

  Answer these research questions for Cycle {X} ({cycle focus}):
  {research_questions list from the cycle YAML}

  Rules:
  - Stay inside the approved question and protocol.
  - Reuse prior formulate and protocol findings before researching beyond them.
  - Stay specific to the variables, artifacts, values, slices, or transformations surfaced by the script.
  - If a question does not apply, say "not applicable" and give a one-line reason.
  - Cite sources for any claim that would change a cleaning or preprocessing decision.

  Return concise findings. Create or reference a `research_log.jsonl` row only for sources that materially change a decision or will be cited in a deliverable; canonical YAML keeps only `research_log#n` pointers. Organize findings by question. Focus on
  facts that materially change cleaning judgments, semantic interpretation,
  or protocol compliance.
  """
)
```

Evaluation subagent:

```text
Agent(
  model="{subagent_model}",
  description="Evaluation for Clean Cycle {X}: {focus}",
  run_in_background=true,
  prompt="""
  You are an objective evaluator for a Skeptic clean cycle.

  Read:
  1. {projects_root}/{project-name}/{docs_dir_name}/03_cleaning.yaml
  2. {projects_root}/{project-name}/{scripts_dir_name}/03_cleaning.py
  3. {projects_root}/{project-name}/{docs_dir_name}/01_formulation.yaml

  Cycle focus: {cycle focus description}
  Cycle YAML for reference: {cycles/{X}.yaml full content}
  Script evidence produced this iteration: {the candidate script_evidence}
  User observations: {decision_ledger entry's user_observations from Step 2, or "none"}

  Active route, visibility rules, clean prohibitions, forbidden variable
  classes, and leakage rules: {summary from 02_protocol.yaml and route file}

  Produce this structured output, in order, with these exact section headings:

  EVALUATION: Cycle {X} - {focus}

  MISSING REQUIRED EVIDENCE (list required evidence keys or judgment outputs that are absent; evidence with a satisfied skip rule is not missing):
  - Unanswered: [list of IDs, or "none"]

  CYCLE-SPECIFIC PCS QUESTIONS (from `pcs_focus.items`, if any):
  {pcs_focus.items from the cycle YAML, one bullet per item, or "none defined"}

  DEFECT SCAN (adversarial mode):
  Assume the work contains errors. Actively falsify the acceptance criteria and material evidence rather than confirm them. Record only failures or non-obvious risks; do not write PASS notes for every criterion. Categories: unstated
  assumptions, outcome-dependent decisions, protocol violations, claim-
  widening moves, cleaning choices that change the analyzable population
  without documentation, leakage risks, restricted-artifact misuse, silent
  drift toward model-family-specific preparation, fit-scope leakage into
  reserved artifacts.
  If after genuinely adversarial scrutiny you find zero defects, state
  "No defects found" and name at least three specific failure modes you
  tested and ruled out. Do not fabricate defects.
  - Defect 1: [description with evidence]
  - Defect 2: [description with evidence]

  SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION:
  - Defect 1: BLOCKING | NON-BLOCKING - [one-line reason]
  - Defect 2: BLOCKING | NON-BLOCKING - [one-line reason]

  ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA ASSESSMENT (list only failed criteria or non-obvious criteria that materially affected the decision; missing required evidence fails dependent criteria):
  - {criterion_id}: PASS | FAIL - [evidence]

  DECISION-RELEVANT COUNTERFACTUAL:
  - Strongest plausible alternative that would change a downstream decision: [alternative, affected decision, why accepted/rejected]

  CLAIM-BOUNDARY CHECK: Verify that no cleaning or preprocessing decision
  this cycle widens `claim_boundary.scope` or loosens `generalization_limit`
  relative to the values frozen in `01_formulation.yaml`. If the cycle
  narrows the claim, state the narrowing entry that should be appended to
  `claim_boundary_updates.narrowing_log`.

  GAPS REMAINING: [list, or "none"]
  PROTOCOL IMPLICATIONS: [facts this cycle surfaced that affect downstream stages, or "none"]
  RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP CYCLE: [topic and whether it belongs in D-series or G-series, or "none"]

  FINAL COUNTS:
  Unanswered items: [count]
  Blocking defects: [count]
  Failed criteria: [count]

  Be objective. Not harsh, not lenient.
  """
)
```

When both subagents return, the model parses three counts from the evaluation output: `Unanswered items`, `Blocking defects`, `Failed criteria`. `blocking_failures = unanswered + blocking_defects + failed_criteria`; `blocking_failures == 0` means PASS. Every required evidence key must be produced or formally skipped, and every acceptance criterion must pass or be explicitly overridden.

Digest subagent replies only when they change the cycle outcome or leave a risk that downstream stages must carry. Store those items in `decision_ledger[*].review_findings`.

Include only:
- blocking findings or failed criteria that drove the decision
- decision-changing external sources, referenced by `research_log#n` when a research log exists
- the strongest rejected alternative when it would change a downstream decision
- unresolved risks that downstream stages must carry

Exclude PASS notes, subagent summaries, restatements of required evidence, sources that did not change behavior, and default implementation choices.

### Step 4: Decision

When both subagents return:

1. Verify each result is non-empty and contains its required sections. If malformed, escalate to the user (interactive) or follow `the `--auto` rule in this SKILL.md` (auto).
2. Parse `Unanswered items`, `Blocking defects`, `Failed criteria` from the evaluation output.
3. Compute `blocking_failures = unanswered + blocking_defects + failed_criteria`.
4. Apply the decision matrix.

Decision matrix:

| blocking_failures | forward actions allowed |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| 0 | pass, iterate |
| > 0 | iterate, acknowledge_gap (with written justification) |

Always available regardless of `blocking_failures`:
- `iterate` -> extend the cycle's function with new checks, rerun Step 1
- `reopen_protocol` -> stop and reopen `protocol` with a written reason
- `reopen_formulate` -> stop and reopen `formulate` (then `protocol`, then return) with a written reason
- `data_insufficient` -> log why and present options (request more data, reformulate, archive)
- `archive` -> stop with documentation of why
- `override` -> user states the specific reason a FAIL is incorrect; logged as `override: {reason, criterion}`; forward actions unlock

Dataset fitness checkpoint (mandatory at Cycle C close, and after any later cycle that materially changes coverage, population, question-critical variables, or visibility): answer each of these and append a record to `dataset_fitness_reviews`:
- Is the cleaned dataset still fit for the approved question?
- Is additional data now required?
- Is the approved question still appropriate for this dataset?
- Did cleaning reveal a protocol mismatch?
- Did cleaning reveal a formulation mismatch?

Any `no` or `unclear` answer must be surfaced to the user as a decision point rather than buried in gaps.

Interactive mode: present the synthesized assessment and the allowed actions via `AskUserQuestion`. Wait for the user's answer before invoking any other tool.

Auto mode: apply the autonomous decision protocol from `the `--auto` rule in this SKILL.md`.

### Step 5: Log

Append one entry to `decision_ledger`. Required fields:

- `cycle`, `iteration`
- `decision`, `blocking_failures`, `blocking_reason`, `evidence_summary`, `changed_fields`, and `next_action`

Write conditional fields only when they apply:

- `user_observations`: captured in Step 2 when AskUserQuestion elicited user input.
- `decision_reason`: required when `decision != pass`.
- `override`: `{reason, criterion}` only when a FAIL was overridden.

`blocking_failures` (0 = PASS, >0 = FAIL) is the enforceable integer summary. Record only material failed criteria, rejected alternatives, or source-backed decisions; do not store Per-criterion PASS notes or full subagent output.

Update every canonical-YAML field named by the cycle spec `writes`, but only for fields this project actually populates. Append to list-valued fields (`cleaning_decisions`, `preprocessing_decisions`, `derived_variables`, `dataset_fitness_reviews`, `claim_boundary_updates.narrowing_log`) rather than overwriting. Leave non-applicable optional fields out entirely rather than setting them to null. Cycle-specific `step4_additions` are applied at this point if the cycle YAML defines them. `pcs_focus` is consumed by the Step 3 evaluation subagent prompt and produces no separate Step 5 entry.

Set `status.current_cycle` to the next cycle letter (or keep for another iteration). Append the closed cycle letter to `status.completed_cycles` only when the cycle passes or is closed by override. When a conditional cycle is skipped with a logged reason, record it under `status.skipped_cycles`.

Re-parse `03_cleaning.yaml` to confirm validity.

## Ending the Cycle Loop

The loop ends when all of the following hold:

- every mandatory cycle (A, B, C, R, S) has a closing `decision` of `pass` or an `override`
- Cycle F is completed with `pass` or `override`, or recorded in `status.skipped_cycles` with a specific reason (e.g., "no derived variables justified by the approved question and protocol")
- every approved D-series or G-series follow-up is resolved
- the latest dataset fitness review returns no unresolved `no` or `unclear` answers
- interactive mode: the user explicitly approves the stage state before finalization
- auto mode: the stage approval checkpoint in `the `--auto` rule in this SKILL.md` completes

Finalization requires explicit stage-close discipline. Do not finalize because the stage "seems good enough."

## PCS Subagent Review

At stage close, after Cycle R and Cycle S have produced reproducibility and robustness outputs:

```text
Agent(
  model="{subagent_model}",
  description="PCS review of clean stage",
  prompt="""
  You are a PCS reviewer for a Skeptic clean stage.

  Read:
  1. {projects_root}/{project-name}/{docs_dir_name}/01_formulation.yaml
  2. {projects_root}/{project-name}/{docs_dir_name}/02_protocol.yaml
  3. {projects_root}/{project-name}/{docs_dir_name}/03_cleaning.yaml
  4. {projects_root}/{project-name}/{scripts_dir_name}/03_cleaning.py

  Evaluate the incremental risk introduced by cleaning and preprocessing. Do
  not restate the full formulation or protocol reviews. Use the approved
  instability thresholds from `robustness.instability_thresholds`. Use
  protocol-conditioned transfer diagnostics only when
  `robustness.transfer_diagnostics_status` is `pass` or `flagged`. Treat
  failed declared-error constraints as a hard defect.

  PREDICTABILITY:
  - Does the cleaned dataset still match the reality the approved question needs?
  - Are dataset fitness reviews consistent with the approved claim boundary?
  - Did any cleaning decision quietly change the target population or deployment context?

  STABILITY:
  - Do cleaning policies match the data-generating process rather than convenience?
  - Would any single judgment call, reversed, change the analyzable population enough to alter the claim boundary?
  - Which judgment call is the main risk driver, if any?
  - Should clean reopen a D-series or G-series follow-up cycle?

  COMPUTABILITY:
  - Is every material transformation expressed in reproducible code another analyst could rerun?
  - Are the `clean_data` and `preprocess_data` signatures clear enough for downstream stages?
  - Do declared-error constraints pass on the cleaned outputs?
  - Is the audit trail strong enough that another analyst could reconstruct why each cleaning choice was made?

  For each lens, state what holds up well, what is uncertain or risky, and
  any specific recommendations. Keep it concise.

```

Digest the review into `pcs_review`: record `overall`, `blocking_findings`, `material_risks`, `material_findings`, `disposition`, and `disposition_reason`. Do not store the full review text unless a FAIL or override makes literal audit text necessary; if retained, store only a pointer in `full_review_pointer`.

- Interactive mode: present via `AskUserQuestion` with options `satisfied`, `valid_concern`, `disagree_override`. Wait for the user's answer before invoking any other tool.
- Auto mode: apply `the `--auto` rule in this SKILL.md` stage-close rules.

Record the chosen disposition and reason in `pcs_review.disposition` and `pcs_review.disposition_reason`.

The subagent advises. It does not silently widen scope or bypass a blocking concern.

## Finalization

After the PCS review clears or the user overrides it:

1. Parse `03_cleaning.yaml` with a standard YAML loader. Repair if parsing fails.

2. Render `03_cleaning.md` from the canonical YAML. Keep the report compact: one `##` section per populated top-level YAML key (`Data Contract`, `Question-Critical Variables`, `Visibility`, `Cleaning Decisions`, `Preprocessing Decisions`, `Derived Variables`, `Row Count Reconciliation`, `Dataset Fitness Reviews`, `Reproducibility`, `Robustness`, `Claim Boundary Updates`, `PCS Assessment`). Omit sections whose YAML keys are empty or absent. Reference the compact `pcs_review` fields through the YAML; the markdown is a rendered summary.

3. Append a Cleaning Scorecard block to `03_cleaning.md`:

   ```markdown
   ### Cleaning Scorecard
   | metric | value | source |
   |--------|-------|--------|
   | Checklist items answered | {answered}/{total} | decision_ledger |
   | Mandatory cycles completed | {n}/6 | status.completed_cycles |
   | Conditional Cycle F | {completed / skipped: {reason}} | status.completed_cycles or status.skipped_cycles |
   | Cleaning follow-ups (D-series) | {n} ({list topics}) | decision_ledger |
   | Preprocessing follow-ups (G-series) | {n} ({list topics}) | decision_ledger |
   | Total iterations (all cycles) | {n} ({cycle}: {n}, ...) | decision_ledger |
   | Blocking failures total | {n across all iterations} | decision_ledger.blocking_failures |
   | Blocking failures resolved by iteration | {n} | decision_ledger |
   | Blocking failures resolved by override | {n} ({list reasons}) | decision_ledger |
   | Snapshot match | {yes / no} | reproducibility.snapshot_match |
   | Declared-error constraints passed | {n}/{total} | reproducibility.*.constraints |
   | Declared-warn constraints passed | {n}/{total} | reproducibility.*.constraints |
   | Judgment calls total | {n} | cleaning_decisions + preprocessing_decisions |
   | Judgment calls stable under perturbation | {n}/{tested} | robustness.layer1_perturbations |
   | Transfer diagnostics | {pass / flagged / skipped: {reason}} | robustness.transfer_diagnostics_status |
   | PCS verdict | {overall plus material findings} | pcs_review |
   | PCS user decision | {satisfied / valid_concern / disagree_override: {reason}} | pcs_review.disposition |
   ```

4. Update `README.md` with:

   ```markdown
   ## Clean [COMPLETE]
   Type: {question_type}
   Protocol mode: {data_usage_mode}
   Visibility: {one-line summary of clean-stage visibility rules}
   Cleaning: {one-line summary of key cleaning decisions}
   Preprocessing: {one-line summary of applied low-regret transformations, or "none"}
   Derived variables: {one-line summary, or "none"}
   Population shift: {one-line summary, or "none"}
   Constraints: {constraint files created}
   Functions: {scripts_dir_name}/03_cleaning.py (clean_data, preprocess_data)
   Next: Examine - inspect cleaned data under protocol rules
   ```

5. Set `status.locked_at: {ISO timestamp}`. Re-parse the YAML to confirm validity.

6. Read `README.md` and include the `## Clean [COMPLETE]` block exactly in the stage-close user message. If the block is not present or any field is empty, finalization is incomplete; return to step 4. Only then tell the user the clean stage is complete.

## Backtracking

If a downstream stage reopens `clean`:

- Preserve every entry in `decision_ledger`. Append new iterations.
- Unlock the stage: set `status.locked_at: null`.
- Re-run the affected cycles and re-render the markdown at the end.
- If reopen is driven by a protocol mismatch, reopen `protocol` first and let its changes flow back into this stage's visibility set and prohibitions before resuming here.
- If reopen is driven by a formulation mismatch, reopen `formulate` first, then `protocol`, then return here.
- Entries already written to `claim_boundary_updates.narrowing_log` remain in place.
