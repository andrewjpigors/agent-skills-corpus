description: Adversarial implementation review with triage and fix loop. Hard-gates on `pnpm check`, delegates to the quality-reviewer agent for categorized findings (Critical/High/Medium/Nice-to-Have/Approved), then triages and fixes findings via the developer agent. Loops until a re-review surfaces no new Critical/High/Medium findings (convergence), with a soft ceiling of 5 cycles before asking the user how to proceed; option 3 of that prompt terminates with verdict `escalated-to-architect`. Autonomous mode via the `auto` token (prompts resolve to documented defaults; used by /auto via /start auto). Use when the user says 'review my work', 'check this implementation', 'adversarial review', 'quality review', or invokes /quality-review.

# Quality Review

Run an adversarial review of the current implementation, then triage and fix findings until the implementation passes cleanly. Designed for use mid-development (before `/finish`) — either standalone, or delegated from `/start` Step 9.

## Arguments

- Issue identifier (e.g., `PL-13`) — optional. Auto-detected from branch/commit when omitted; if no issue can be resolved, the skill runs without requirements-conformance context.
- Positional file paths — optional override of the auto-detected scope.
- `auto` — optional token (case-insensitive, position-agnostic). **Autonomous mode**: every prompt resolves to a documented default instead of asking — the Step 5 soft-ceiling prompt resolves to option 2 (`terminated-with-open-items`), sub-step 6's filing prompt resolves to `suggested`, and sub-step 6's state-name fallback files into the team default state (noted in the verdict block) rather than asking. Nothing else changes. Passed through by `/start auto` for the `/auto` loop.

Examples: `/quality-review`, `/quality-review PL-13`, `/quality-review auto PL-13`, `/quality-review src/foo.ts src/bar.ts`, `/quality-review PL-13 packages/api/`

Reject any bare argument that is neither an issue-ID (`[A-Z]+-[0-9]+`), the `auto` token, nor a path that exists on disk. In particular, the tokens `merge`, `pr`, `no push`, `don't push`, `skip push` are `/finish` arguments — if seen here, error with: `Argument 'X' is a /finish argument, not a /quality-review argument` rather than silently treating it as a file path that doesn't exist (which would just produce an empty scope and warn about nothing to review).

## Invariant

**Working Application Contract.** This skill assumes the application was working before the changes under review. `pnpm check` is the gate that proves it still is. A check failure after our changes is never "pre-existing", never "out of scope" — it is our breakage and must be fixed before review proceeds. Turborepo caching makes repeated runs cheap.

## Workflow

### Preflight: Exit Plan Mode If Active

If the session is in plan mode when `/quality-review` is invoked standalone, call `ExitPlanMode` **before any other step**. Step 1 onward needs Bash (`detect-issue-id.sh`, `git diff`, `pnpm check`, etc.), Agent (for the `quality-reviewer`/`developer` delegations), and Write (verdict persistence) — all blocked in plan mode.

**Detection.** Use the harness's plan-mode indicator visible at skill entry (the same signal that was gating tool calls just before this skill loaded). If that indicator is ambiguous or unavailable, attempt Step 1; if `detect-issue-id.sh` fails with a plan-mode block, return here, call `ExitPlanMode`, then retry Step 1. Do NOT speculatively call `ExitPlanMode` when plan mode is not active — it raises a spurious approval prompt the user must dismiss.

**Plan body.** Pass a one-line plan summarizing what `/quality-review` is about to do. There is nothing to design — `/quality-review` is a fixed mechanical workflow — but `ExitPlanMode` is the only way to leave plan mode and it requires a plan body. For the `<ISSUE-ID>` substitution: only inline a user-supplied token if it matches `^[A-Z]+-[0-9]+$` (case-insensitive, uppercase it before substituting); otherwise use `the current change set`.

- Approved by the user: proceed to Step 1.
- Rejected by the user: stop with `/quality-review aborted at preflight: user rejected plan-mode exit. No review ran; no verdict persisted.` Do NOT emit a lifecycle tag — `/quality-review` does not normally emit one, and no skill-stage code ran. The absence of a persisted verdict file is the signal a later `/finish` will see (`VERDICT=none-found`).
- Tool-error / harness failure (not a user rejection — the tool itself returns an error, or the harness reports `ExitPlanMode` failed for a non-user-cancel reason): surface the error verbatim and stop with `/quality-review aborted at preflight: ExitPlanMode failed (<first line of error>). No review ran; no verdict persisted.` Do NOT continue to Step 1; plan mode is still active.

**Delegated invocation note.** When `/quality-review` is invoked by `/start` Step 9, plan mode is not active — the parent session either already exited it at `/start` Step 6 or (in auto mode) never entered it — so this preflight is a no-op in that path. The hazard only applies to ad-hoc standalone invocations of `/quality-review`.

**Skip this preflight only when plan mode is NOT active** (the common case).

### Step 1: Resolve Scope

**Issue ID** — delegate to the shared script (same one `/start` and `/finish` use):

```bash
~/.claude/scripts/detect-issue-id.sh [--input <USER-SUPPLIED-ID>]
```

Pass `--input` only when the user typed an explicit ID (e.g., `/quality-review PL-13`). The script tries `--input` → current branch → latest commit subject, in that order. On exit 1 (no ID resolvable), proceed without issue context — the requirements-conformance bullet in the reviewer prompt is omitted.

**Scope-mismatch guard.** When the issue ID was auto-detected (branch/commit — not typed by the user) and the scope comes from explicit positional file paths that are clearly not that issue's implementation (e.g., side work — config, docs, tooling — reviewed from a feature branch named for an unrelated issue), proceed WITHOUT issue context and state that in chat. Never persist a verdict keyed to an issue whose implementation the reviewed diff is not — the persisted file would overwrite that issue's real verdict at `tmp/quality-review-verdict-<issue>.md` with a fresher mtime, misleading `/finish` Step 8's gate and defeating its staleness check. A user-typed explicit issue ID is an instruction, not a detection — this guard does not apply.

**Changed files** (in priority order):

1. Explicit positional args from the invocation
2. Auto-detected via:

   ```bash
   git diff --name-only "$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)"...HEAD
   git status --porcelain -z --untracked-files=all --no-renames | tr '\0' '\n' | cut -c4-
   ```

   Same bare-path form `/start` Step 0 uses (`-z` avoids C-quoting/octal-escaping under `core.quotePath`; `cut -c4-` strips the fixed-width status prefix; `--no-renames` keeps every record to one field). Union the two sets. If the union is empty, warn the user and exit — there is nothing to review.

   **Worktree source-branch awareness.** Before defaulting to `origin/main` as the merge-base target, check whether this session is inside a `/start wt` worktree with a recorded source branch:

   ```bash
   WT_ABS="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
   git -C "$WT_ABS" config --worktree --get start.source-branch
   ```

   If it returns a value, use that branch instead of `origin/main` for the merge-base diff:

   ```bash
   git diff --name-only "$(git merge-base HEAD <source-branch>)"...HEAD
   ```

   `origin/main` is very likely NOT this worktree's actual parent — diffing against it can return the entire accumulated history of a long-running feature branch (thousands of files) instead of the session's actual changes. Fall back to `origin/main` when the config is absent.

**Issue requirements** (only if an issue was resolved):

```bash
linear-cli issues get PL-13
```

Cache the output for the entire run — do not re-fetch on each review cycle.

> **Worktree isolation (`wt` mode) — pin every delegation, verify every placement.** This skill can't see `/start`'s session-level `IS_WT` (Step 0), so it gates on the caller-independent form `/start` Step 8 item 1 names for exactly this purpose — reusing `/start`'s own derivation verbatim:
>
> ```bash
> WT_ABS="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
> MAIN_CHECKOUT="$(dirname "$(git -C "$WT_ABS" rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)")"
>
> # Hard precondition guard — `git -C ""` is a documented no-op (leaves cwd unchanged, exits 0), so an
> # empty/wrong path here would silently measure the wrong tree instead of failing loudly. Only the
> # first two lines of /start's equivalent guard apply here — NOT its third line asserting
> # WT_ABS != MAIN_CHECKOUT. In /start, equality means worktree registration failed (a hard error). Here,
> # equality is the legitimate not-a-worktree case — this skill running standalone outside any /start wt
> # worktree — so the gate below (WT_ABS != MAIN_CHECKOUT) simply doesn't arm. Do not "fix" this
> # asymmetry by importing /start's third line; it would hard-fail every plain non-worktree
> # /quality-review run.
> [ -n "$WT_ABS" ] && [ -d "$WT_ABS" ] || { echo "FAILED: WT_ABS unset or not a directory" >&2; exit 1; }
> [ -n "$MAIN_CHECKOUT" ] && [ -d "$MAIN_CHECKOUT" ] || { echo "FAILED: MAIN_CHECKOUT unset or not a directory" >&2; exit 1; }
> ```
>
> **`WT_ABS != MAIN_CHECKOUT` is the gate — necessary and sufficient.** Unequal means a separate main checkout exists this session and can be contaminated; that alone is enough to arm the mitigation below, regardless of any config value. Equal means there is no separate checkout in the picture at all (this session's cwd IS the main checkout), so `wt` mode is false — there is nothing a mis-bound delegate could contaminate beyond the tree it's already in.
>
> As corroboration only — never as a necessary condition — the per-worktree config confirms this is specifically a `/start wt` worktree with a recorded source branch:
>
> ```bash
> WT_ABS="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
> git -C "$WT_ABS" config --worktree --get start.source-branch
> ```
>
> Do NOT require this probe to return a value before arming the mitigation: `standards/lifecycle-tags.md`'s `BLOCKED-ON-RECOVERY` row documents "source-branch config wiped" as a real hijack-corruption scenario, so a wiped config in a genuine, still-separate worktree would otherwise silently disarm the mitigation exactly when it matters most. A missing value here is worth noting, not trusting as "not a worktree."
>
> **Ensure the baseline is session-fresh before this skill's first delegation** — `/start` Step 0 sub-step 2 requires exactly this of "any skill that arms this mitigation," and a standalone `/quality-review` is the case it names explicitly. Both the capture and the item-1 placement check go through `~/.claude/scripts/wt-baseline.sh` (`capture` / `diff`), which anchors its files to `$WT_ABS` (derived above) rather than bare `tmp/` — the calls run as separate Bash invocations with no shared cwd. Pass the lowercased issue ID as the token, or the literal `no-issue` if Step 1 resolved no issue ID (which can only happen standalone, since `/start` Step 9 always dispatches this skill with an explicit issue ID). The script is authoritative for the measurement mechanics; do not re-implement them here.
>
> - **Delegated from `/start` Step 9:** Step 0 already took this session's baseline before Step 8 ran. Reuse it as-is — do NOT retake it here. Retaking now would fold Step 8's already-verified-clean activity into a brand-new baseline, blinding this skill's own checks to anything that slipped past Step 8's per-delegation verification in the interim.
> - **Standalone** (the user invoked `/quality-review` directly): no session-fresh baseline exists yet. Take it now, before Step 2's first delegation — `~/.claude/scripts/wt-baseline.sh capture "$WT_ABS" <issue-id-lowercased|no-issue>` — which overwrites any stale file left on disk, per `/start` Step 0's "never reused across sessions" rule. Proceed only on `CAPTURED`; a `FAILED` verdict is a fail-closed STOP.
> - **Telling them apart:** the reliable signal is session continuity — a delegated run has `/start` Step 0 moments earlier in this same conversation; a standalone run has no such history. When that history cannot be confirmed, treat it as standalone and retake: an unneeded retake before the first delegation costs one hash recompute, while reusing a baseline that turns out stale reproduces the exact bug this note exists to prevent (false accusations from paths main acquired since, misses from paths already dirty then). Concretely: retake whenever the baseline file (`<wt-abs>/tmp/main-dirty-baseline-<token>.txt` — the file `wt-baseline.sh capture` writes) is absent, or its this-session provenance cannot be confirmed — never skip retaking merely because a file happens to exist on disk.
>
> When `wt` mode is detected, every delegation below is exposed to the hazard `/start` Step 8 documents — `EnterWorktree`'s isolation registration is best-effort, not a guarantee, and a delegate can write into the main checkout while reporting success and while `pnpm check` stays green (a worktree missing a delegate's changes still type-checks). `/start` Step 8 is the single source of truth for the response: its delegation-format template's READ-SCOPING and WRITE-PLACEMENT blocks, and its "After each delegation completes" item 1 placement check and stop-and-report contract — contamination is a STOP handed to a human, there is no automated recovery, and this skill never restores, extracts, or applies anything in either tree — do not restate those commands, pathspec rules, or reporting steps here. Split by agent type, mirroring `/start` Step 8: READ-SCOPING is a floor required on **every** delegation below regardless of agent type; the WRITE-PLACEMENT *prompt* block (the changed-path self-report instructions) applies only to this skill's write-capable delegations (`developer`) — its read-only delegations (`quality-reviewer`, `architect`) get no such block, since they change nothing and produce no changed-path list. The item-1 placement check itself is **not** scoped this way: mirroring `/start` Step 8's final form, it runs after **every** delegation below regardless of agent type — a read-only delegate can still write into the main checkout under a mis-bound registration, and the check costs the same one `git status`-equivalent pass either way. That is every delegation site in this skill: Step 2's `developer` fix delegation; Step 3's `quality-reviewer` review; Step 5 item 2's `developer` fix delegations, item 3's further-fix delegation, item 4's re-review, and option 3's `architect` escalation; Step 6 sub-step 5's `developer` deferred-item fix delegations (including the prose-only and corrective passes) and its `quality-reviewer` re-reviews (the mandatory one and the optional confirmatory one under the upgrade-on-success exception); and the Error Handling section's corrective `quality-reviewer` re-spawn.
>
> This matters most in the fix loop: a fix that lands in the wrong tree makes the re-review pass against code that was never actually in the worktree — and neither a green `pnpm check` nor a delegate's success report is evidence of correct placement.
>
> **Tag authority.** `/quality-review` is not a lifecycle-tag authority (see the preflight above and `standards/lifecycle-tags.md`'s emitter table). If contamination is detected inside one of this skill's own delegations: when an issue ID was resolved in Step 1, write the mis-landed bare repo-relative paths to `tmp/contamination-comment-<issue-id-lowercased>.md` (the `Write` tool) and post it — `~/.claude/scripts/linear-post.sh comment <ISSUE-ID> tmp/contamination-comment-<issue-id-lowercased>.md` — before terminating; this is the durable record a human needs to recover, and under `/auto` the only place it gets written (`/start` Step 8's own Linear comment lives in its own auto-mode branch, which contamination inside this skill's delegations never reaches). If no issue ID was resolved, there is nowhere to post — say so and surface to chat instead. Either way, do NOT emit `BLOCKED-ON-REVIEW` or any other lifecycle tag — terminate with `Verdict: terminated-with-open-items` and an `Open items:` line carrying the exact literal sentinel `/start` Step 10 keys off, e.g. `Open items: MAIN-CHECKOUT-CONTAMINATION — <bare repo-relative paths, comma-separated>; <any other open items>` (paths are the mis-landed ones reported above; omit the trailing `; ...` clause when nothing else is open) — the same machinery the Step 5 soft ceiling and Step 6 sub-step 5 regression cap already use to terminate this way, now with that one literal token added. The run still proceeds through the Output section's mandatory verdict persistence (skipping it would leave `/finish` Step 1.5 seeing `VERDICT=none-found` and proceeding on only a warning) but skips Step 7's `/reflect` — see Step 7's rules for the exception. `/start` Step 10 maps the persisted verdict to the single lifecycle tag for the session.

### Step 2: Working Application Gate

```bash
pnpm check
```

If it **fails**: we took a working application and broke it. That is our failure. Do not proceed to review. Do not rationalize. Delegate fixes to `developer` immediately with the explicit instruction: "The application was working before our changes. It is now broken. Fix it." Re-run `pnpm check`. Repeat until it passes. There is no path forward through a broken application.

If it **passes**: the Working Application Contract holds. Proceed to the adversarial review.

### Step 3: Delegate Adversarial Review

```md
Task for quality-reviewer: Adversarial implementation review for PL-13
Context: Implementation of [issue title or one-line summary of the change] is complete. Your job is to try to break it.
Issue requirements: [Paste requirement checkboxes from the issue — omit this line entirely if no issue was resolved in Step 1]
Files: [List every file in the resolved scope from Step 1]
Requirements:
- Verify every issue requirement is actually satisfied, not just approximately
- Find edge cases with concrete triggering scenarios
- Trace error paths for completeness (including partial failure)
- Check implicit assumptions about inputs, state, and ordering
- Identify concurrency/timing issues under load
- Assess security surface beyond obvious vulnerabilities
- Check integration boundaries with existing code
- Verify conformance against user-level and project-level conventions
Acceptance: Produce a categorized findings report following the Required findings format below — markdown sections with `## Review Findings` heading and the five `### <severity>` subheadings, in that order. Do NOT emit JSON arrays of findings, tables, "Verification summary" sections, "Categorization" tallies, or any alternative structure. The format is parsed by sub-step 1 below; deviations break the consolidation step and surface raw output to the user.
```

For large changes spanning multiple domains, **always** spawn parallel reviewers scoped by domain in a single message (e.g., one for backend, one for frontend). The same parallelism principle applies here — reviews are independent and must run simultaneously. Consolidate findings before proceeding.

**Required findings format** (this is the parsed contract — the `quality-reviewer` agent's system prompt also specifies it; both must agree):

```markdown
## Review Findings

### Critical (must fix before done)
- [Finding]: [File:line] — [concrete scenario that triggers it]

### High (should fix)
- [Finding]: [File:line] — [concrete scenario that triggers it]

### Medium (real risk, lower probability)
- [Finding]: [File:line] — [scenario and likelihood assessment]

### Nice-to-Have (auto-fix lane)
- [Finding]: [file:line] — [the concrete fix — queued for /quality-review Step 6 triage]

### Approved
- [What survived adversarial review and why]
```

**Mid-run surfacing.** When reviewer findings are surfaced or summarized to the user before Step 6 (e.g., background-reviewer results arriving mid-run), state the Nice-to-Have lane's disposition explicitly: these items are queued for Step 6 triage — auto-fixed when safe, offered for filing when ticket-worthy, recorded under `Deferred dropped`, or (on early termination: `terminated-with-open-items` / `escalated-to-architect`) routed to `Open items` instead — never silently ignored. A raw report carries no disposition signal on its own, and "non-gating" reads as "won't fix" without it.

### Step 4: Evaluate Verdict

If findings contain **no Critical, High, or Medium items** → review passes. Proceed to Step 6 with verdict `passed-clean` (cycle 1) or `passed-after-fixes` (later cycles).

If **any** Critical, High, or Medium findings exist → proceed to Step 5.

Nice-to-Have findings do not affect the verdict; they are handled in Step 6 (auto-fixed, filed, or recorded as dropped) once the loop terminates cleanly.

### Step 5: Triage & Fix Loop

If Critical, High, or Medium findings exist, triage, fix, and re-review until the implementation passes cleanly.

**1. Fix every Critical/High/Medium finding in scope, including pre-existing ones in touched files.** Leave code better than you found it. If the reviewer flagged it at this severity, it is not deferrable — Step 6 handles deferrable items via the Nice-to-Have category.

**2. Fix all Critical/High/Medium items** — delegate to `developer`. If multiple findings are in independent files, launch parallel fix agents:

```md
Task for developer: Fix review findings for PL-13
Context: Quality reviewer identified the following issues.
Findings:
- [Finding 1]: [File:line] — [explanation]
- [Finding 2]: [File:line] — [explanation]
Requirements:
- Address each finding precisely — no unrelated changes
- When a finding involves classifying enum variants, error kinds, states, or cases into behavioral buckets (transient/terminal, retry/fail, etc.): enumerate EVERY variant from the defining source and classify each explicitly — never fix only the flagged variant(s) or write "etc.". Completing the partition is part of addressing the finding precisely, not an unrelated change; incomplete partitions are how the same defect resurfaces one variant at a time across re-review cycles.
- Verify with type checks or tests as appropriate
Acceptance: All listed findings resolved, no regressions.
```

After fixes are applied, you MUST continue through items 3→4→5 below. Do not stop after fixing.

**3. Verify check passes** — after fixes, re-run `pnpm check`. If it fails, delegate further fixes before proceeding.

**4. Re-review (MANDATORY)** — fixes are not complete until re-reviewed. Spawn `quality-reviewer` scoped to only the changed files:

```md
Task for quality-reviewer: Adversarial re-review of fixes for PL-13
Context: Previous adversarial review findings were addressed. Your job is to verify fixes are correct and try to break them again.
Changed files: [list]
Previous findings addressed: [list]
Acceptance: Confirm findings resolved. Flag any new Critical, High, or Medium issues with concrete scenarios.
```

**5. Loop** — if the re-review surfaces new Critical, High, or Medium issues, return to the top of this step (triage → fix → check → re-review).

**Termination**: The loop terminates by **convergence** — when a re-review surfaces no new Critical, High, or Medium findings, exit Step 5 with verdict `passed-after-fixes` and proceed to Step 6.

**Soft ceiling**: After **5 review cycles** (initial review + up to 4 re-reviews), pause and ask the user how to proceed instead of looping silently. Reviewers tend to find *something* on every cycle, so an unbounded loop can run away even when the implementation is materially improving. The ceiling is not a hard cap — the user can extend it.

```text
The implementation has gone through 5 review cycles and still has unresolved findings:
[list current findings]

Cycle-by-cycle trend: [e.g., "5 → 3 → 2 → 2 → 2" so the user can see whether progress is stalling or converging]

Options:
1. Continue fixing — run another N cycles, default N=3
2. Accept current state — terminate with verdict `terminated-with-open-items` and treat surviving findings as Open items
3. Revisit the approach with the architect agent

Reply with `1` (optionally `1 5` for a custom N), `2`, or `3`.
```

**Auto mode:** do not ask — resolve the ceiling prompt to option 2 immediately (terminate with `terminated-with-open-items`, surviving findings as Open items). Five cycles without convergence in an unattended run is a signal for a human, not more unattended cycles; the failing verdict makes `/finish auto` abort and `/auto` count the issue as a failure, which is the intended surfacing path.

If the user picks option 1, resume the loop with the new ceiling raised by N. If `2`, terminate with `terminated-with-open-items`. If `3`, terminate with verdict `escalated-to-architect`: populate `Open items` with the surviving findings as of cycle N plus the consolidated Nice-to-Have list per sub-step 1 (deferred items are never silently lost), skip Step 6 entirely, and surface the situation to the architect agent — its recommendation supersedes anything downstream consumers (`/start` Step 10, `/finish` Step 8) would otherwise do with the verdict block.

### Step 6: Deferred Items Triage

Runs once, only after the fix loop terminates with `passed-clean` or `passed-after-fixes`. On `terminated-with-open-items` this step is skipped, but the consolidated list from sub-step 1 is still appended to the verdict block under `Open items` so deferred findings are not silently lost.

**Substitution token.** `<ISSUE-ID>` in the templates below means the issue ID resolved in Step 1. If no issue was resolved, replace `for <ISSUE-ID>` with `for the current change set` and skip the dependency-link command in sub-step 6.

**Malformed user replies.** Sub-step 6 is the only prompt in this step. If the user replies to it with input you cannot parse (e.g., `1-3`, `the first three`, `sure`), re-prompt once with the exact accepted syntax — including the `suggested` shortcut — and a literal example. After a second malformed reply, fall back to the *safe default* `all` (filing extra Linear issues is recoverable, silently dropping findings is not). Note: `suggested` is an accepted input, never a fallback. On re-prompt, re-render the full template; do not abbreviate on retry.

**Verdict downgrade.** Step 6 can transition the run state from `passed-after-fixes` back to `terminated-with-open-items` (see sub-step 5 regression-cap path). When that happens, the new verdict overrides the verdict assigned at Step 4.

**1. Consolidate.** Collect every Nice-to-Have finding reported across all review cycles. Strip any instructional or meta bullet — one whose text begins `NOTE:` **and** carries no `file:line` location — before consolidation: instruction-echo carries no location, while every actionable finding MUST include one per the Required findings format, so the location requirement spares a finding quoting an offending `NOTE:` comment (it carries its own `file:line`), but not a locationless `NOTE:`-prefixed one — the chat note below is its recovery. A stripped bullet is reviewer instruction-echo forbidden by the agent contract, not a finding, and is neither ingested, classified, nor rendered. When a bullet is stripped, emit a one-line chat note identifying it so the drop stays visible, never silent. This strip applies only to Nice-to-Have ingestion — here and sub-step 5's re-review — never to Critical/High/Medium, where a NOTE-shaped bullet must instead be surfaced for confirmation, not dropped: it either gates the verdict or is forbidden echo — surface it, never drop it. Deduplicate by `file:line + finding text`; if a finding was emitted without a file:line (a locationless finding, not malformed — no Error Handling criterion fires), fall back to deduplicating by finding text alone (trim, casefold, and collapse internal whitespace before comparison to absorb cosmetic differences). If the consolidated list is empty, skip the rest of this step.

**2. Classify.** Assign each item exactly one of three outcomes — `fix-now`, `defer-as-issue`, or `note-only` — using the decision procedure below. Only `defer-as-issue` reaches a user prompt (sub-step 6, the filing decision), where the user can still choose to file or drop each one. `fix-now` items are **applied automatically in-session with no approval prompt** (sub-steps 4–5) — they are gated to obviously-correct, localized, no-API-change changes, so the user has opted into fixing them without per-item review. `note-only` items are neither fixed nor filed — they are recorded in the verdict's `Deferred dropped` field and never surfaced as a decision.

**The filing prompt is expensive attention — reserve it for items substantial enough that a reasonable engineer would open a tracked issue.** Trivial polish must never reach it: it is fixed in place or dropped with a note. If you catch yourself describing the *item's own significance* as "minor", "trivial", "polish", "nice-to-have", or "fine as-is" in the same breath as recommending it be filed — **stop and re-examine.** That contradiction almost always means it is `fix-now` (if safe and within reach) or `note-only` (if out of scope), not `defer-as-issue`. The one exception: an item that genuinely clears gate 3 (a real decision, design, or broader test/perf/security strategy is required) but merely *lives in* incidentally "minor" code — e.g. "this rarely-used path needs a security-strategy decision before it can be fixed." There the significance is real and "minor" describes the location, not the item; it stays `defer-as-issue`. The test targets items whose own importance is minor, not every incidental use of the word.

**Decision procedure — evaluate top-to-bottom; first match wins:**

1. **Comment-, doc-, or rule-text-only fix** → `fix-now`. See the prose-only rule below, which overrides every gate that follows.
2. **Clears all of these `fix-now` gates** → `fix-now`:
   - One obviously-correct change — no decision between valid alternatives. *Following an established codebase pattern is **not** an open design choice:* "I'd have to look at how it's done elsewhere" satisfies *this* sub-gate. It does not waive the others — a pattern applied across many files still fails the localization sub-gate, and one that changes an exported contract still fails the contract sub-gate; either failure sends the item to gate 3.
   - Localized (single file or small contiguous region).
   - No change to public APIs, schemas, exported types, or contracts.
   - Small (~<30 lines diff, no new abstractions).
   - Attach a one-word kind tag: `[mechanical]`, `[naming-only]`, `[missing-guard]`, `[typo]`, `[dead-code]`, `[comment-fix]`, `[doc-fix]`, etc.

   This is the **default home for trivial polish**. When genuinely torn between `fix-now` and `note-only` for a small, safe change, prefer `fix-now` — the standing preference is to improve the code, not surface it. **The lane is non-gating, not optional**: every Nice-to-Have finding with a safe, concrete fix is `fix-now`, including rule/doc corrections, provably-inert cruft, and cosmetic regressions the change under review itself introduced.
3. **Genuinely ticket-worthy** — *any* of the following hold **and** a reasonable engineer would open a tracked issue for it → `defer-as-issue`:
   - Requires a design choice between valid alternatives.
   - Cross-cutting / touches multiple modules.
   - Changes public APIs, schemas, or external contracts.
   - Needs a broader test, perf, or security strategy.
   - Significant scope (refactor, new abstraction) that cannot reasonably be resolved now.
   - Attach a one-word kind tag: `[design TBD]`, `[cross-cutting]`, `[api-change]`, `[needs-perf-data]`, `[scope: multi-module]`, `[refactor]`, etc.
4. **Otherwise** → `note-only`. Reserved for a finding that has **no safe, concrete fix** — an inherent or external-library limitation, a constraint nothing in-repo can change — **and** is not substantial enough to track. This is a narrow bucket: **"no visual harm," "cosmetic," "no-op," "not a regression," "harmless to the app," and "out of scope" are NOT grounds for `note-only`** when a safe, localized fix exists — those are `fix-now` (gate 2). A provably-inert no-op prop, a redundant token, or a cosmetic regression the change under review itself introduced all have a concrete fix (delete the inert code / restore the intended behavior), so they are `fix-now`, never dropped here. Record a genuine `note-only` item (verbatim finding + file:line + one-line rationale) for the `Deferred dropped` verdict field; do not fix it, do not file it, do not prompt.

A `fix-now` candidate that fails a gate-2 safety check (e.g., a `[mechanical]` rename that also touches a public type) does **not** auto-apply — it falls through to gate 3, where the contract change makes it ticket-worthy → `defer-as-issue`. **Failing the fix-now gate never implies ticket-worthy on its own:** a minor item that is simply out of scope falls all the way through to `note-only`, not the prompt.

**Prose-only fixes are always `fix-now` — never `defer-as-issue` and never fileable.** A *prose-only* fix edits only non-executable text: a code comment, a doc-string, or a standalone documentation/rule file (`.claude/rules/*.md`, `standards/*.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and the like). When the prose is stale, incorrect, misleading, or self-contradictory and the code/policy it describes is already correct, correcting it touches no behavior, API, schema, or contract — so it is trivially safe to apply in-session, and filing a Linear issue to correct prose is pure overhead. This **overrides** gates 2–4 of the procedure above and any "out of scope" reasoning — even when the prose lives in a file you would otherwise leave untouched (e.g. an already-run migration whose comment is wrong, or a rule doc in `.claude/rules/` that points readers at the wrong file: correcting either changes no behavior). It applies **wherever** a prose-only finding surfaces, including ones first raised by the sub-step 5 re-review. **Three exclusions:** a fix that edits *both* code and prose is not prose-only — apply the standard criteria; prose that is wrong *because the code is wrong* is a code defect — fix the code at its real severity, never paper over it by rewording the prose; and a doc/rule edit that changes the rule's *meaning or policy* (not merely correcting a stale, wrong, or contradictory fact) is a design decision — apply the standard criteria, and it may be `defer-as-issue`.

**3. Present grouped lists.** Render the two **actionable** sub-groups — `fix-now` and `defer-as-issue` — as labeled sub-groups with continuous numbering across both. Omit a group header entirely if its group is empty (do not print "(none)"). **`note-only` items are not rendered here** — they are neither fixed nor filed, so listing them would surface exactly the minor items this classification is meant to keep out of the user's view; they appear only in the verdict's `Deferred dropped` field.

```text
Deferred items surfaced during review:

Auto-fixing now (no approval needed):
  1. [Finding] — [file:line] — [tag] — [rationale]
  2. [Finding] — [file:line] — [tag] — [rationale]

Suggested defer as issue (needs research/planning):
  3. [Finding] — [file:line] — [tag] — [rationale]
  4. [Finding] — [file:line] — [tag] — [rationale]
```

**Prompt mechanism (applies to sub-step 6).** Sub-step 6 is the only prompt in Step 6 — it asks about exactly one action verb ("file as issue"). `fix-now` items are auto-applied in sub-steps 4–5 with no prompt, so there is no second prompt to disambiguate against. Specifically:

- Render the unfixed-items list from sub-step 6 as **plain text above the question**. Do not rewrite an item's label to encode the action verb — the [tag] communicates the recommendation; the label is the finding.
- The question itself MAY be an `AskUserQuestion` multiSelect, but if so:
  - Every option label must read as "file [finding]".
  - Pre-check (`[✔]`) the items the classification suggests (the `defer-as-issue` group) so the user can accept the suggestion with one click.
  - Do **not** add an "Other" / "type something" / "I have a different choice" option to the options array. The `AskUserQuestion` tool surfaces an "Other" capability automatically (per its tool description: "Users will always be able to select 'Other' to provide custom text input"; "There should be no 'Other' option, that will be provided automatically"). The chat is always available for the user to interject a different reply (e.g., `none`, a comma-list, or free-text). An explicit "type something" option is redundant clutter — the multiSelect must contain exactly the N finding options and nothing else.
- Equivalent plain-text reply is also acceptable per the existing `suggested / all / none / comma-list` semantics below.
- Item labels in the rendered list and in the `AskUserQuestion` option labels MUST use the same identifiers. Use Arabic numerals only (`1`, `2`, `3`, …) — never letters, never roman numerals, never any other scheme. An option labeled "Items 5, 6" must refer to items literally labeled `5.` and `6.` in the rendered list directly above.

**4. Select fix-now items for auto-apply.** No prompt — every item in the `fix-now` group is applied in-session automatically. These are gated to obviously-correct, localized, no-API-change changes, and the user has opted into fixing them without per-item approval. The set to fix = every `fix-now` item from sub-step 2.

**Entry gate — skip sub-steps 4–5 entirely if the `fix-now` group is empty.** With nothing to apply, proceed directly to sub-step 6.

Before delegating, emit a one-line chat note listing the items being auto-applied so the user has visibility (e.g., `Auto-fixing 3 deferred items in-session: #1, #2, #4`). Then proceed to sub-step 5.

**5. Fix the fix-now items.** If the `fix-now` group is non-empty:

- Delegate to `developer` with all `fix-now` findings (parallel agents if findings are in independent files, same pattern as Step 5).
- Re-run `pnpm check`. If it fails after a single corrective `developer` delegation, surface the failure via the Error Handling path and stop — do not loop indefinitely.
- Spawn a single `quality-reviewer` re-review scoped to **only** the files touched by the deferred fixes:

  ```md
  Task for quality-reviewer: Adversarial re-review of deferred-item fixes for <ISSUE-ID>
  Context: Previously deferred Nice-to-Have items were just fixed. Verify correctness; try to break them.
  Changed files: [list]
  Previous deferred findings addressed: [list]
  Acceptance: Confirm fixes are correct. Flag any new findings (any severity) with concrete scenarios.
  ```

- If the re-review surfaces new **Nice-to-Have** findings:
  - **Prose-only findings** (sub-step 2's prose-only rule — comments, doc-strings, and standalone doc/rule text) are never fileable. Fix each in its **own** `developer` delegation scoped to the comment/doc text, then re-run `pnpm check` (cheap and turbo-cached — it catches a delegation that strayed beyond prose text). **On a clean check**, record them under `Deferred fixed in-session`; a clean-check prose-only edit touches only comment/doc text, so it cannot be implicated in any Critical/High/Medium regression and stays listed as fixed regardless of how the next bullet resolves. **If the check fails**, the delegation strayed beyond prose text and is no longer prose-only — treat that breakage as a regression and handle it through the Critical/High/Medium bullet below, whose single corrective pass and verdict population then apply unchanged (the strayed change is routed to `Open items` if unrecovered, with no "fixed" label on a broken build). No further re-review cycle of its own is needed.
  - Run all **other** new Nice-to-Have findings through sub-step 2's decision procedure. Those classified `defer-as-issue` are appended to the remaining unfixed list for sub-step 6. Those classified `note-only` — including a `fix-now`-shaped nit, which is **not** re-fixed here (this is a single confirmatory pass, not a new fix loop) — are recorded for `Deferred dropped` and **never** appended to the sub-step 6 list: surfacing a minor, non-fileable nit as a filing prompt is the exact regression sub-step 2 exists to prevent.
- If the re-review surfaces new **Critical/High/Medium** findings (regressions caused by the deferred-item fixes), make exactly **one** corrective pass: delegate to `developer` to fix the regressions, then re-run `pnpm check`. Do **not** re-enter the Step 5 loop.
  - **Upgrade-on-success exception.** If the corrective pass produces a clean `pnpm check` AND the diff stays scoped to the regression area, an OPTIONAL single confirmatory `quality-reviewer` re-review MAY be spawned (scoped to just the corrective-pass files). If that re-review returns no new Critical/High/Medium findings, **restore the verdict to `passed-after-fixes`** rather than terminating with open items, and continue to sub-step 6. This prevents the regression-cap path from forcing a downgrade on a genuinely successful recovery.
  - If the confirmatory re-review is skipped, or surfaces new findings, or the corrective `pnpm check` still fails, or any of the original regressions remain unaddressed in the diff, terminate Step 6 immediately. On termination, populate the verdict block as follows:
  - **Verdict:** `terminated-with-open-items` (overriding the Step 4 verdict).
  - **Deferred fixed in-session:** deferred items whose fixes are not implicated in the regression. If causation cannot be cleanly attributed (the developer landed multiple fixes in one delegation and the re-review surfaced regressions from "this delta"), list **none** of them as fixed and route every auto-applied item to `Open items` — readers should not see "fixed" labels on changes that broke the application. This carve-out does **not** sweep in *clean-check* prose-only fixes from the independent delegation above: having passed their `pnpm check`, they touch no code in the implicated delta, so they remain listed under `Deferred fixed in-session`. (A prose-only delegation whose check *failed* is not one of these — per the Nice-to-Have bullet above it is itself treated as a regression and routed to `Open items`.)
  - **Open items:** the surviving Critical/High/Medium regressions, **plus** the implicated deferred-item fixes per the rule above, **plus** any not-yet-offered `defer-as-issue` items (the user never reached sub-step 6, so those *fileable* items are not silently dropped — they are surfaced for manual follow-up). `note-only` items are **not** swept here — see `Deferred dropped` below.
  - **Deferred dropped:** the `note-only` items, if any — from sub-step 2 or classified by the sub-step 5 re-review — their disposition was decided at classification and does not depend on reaching sub-step 6. (No user-declined items exist here: sub-step 6 was skipped.)
  - Skip sub-step 6.

**6. Offer Linear issues for unfixed items.**

**Entry gate — skip sub-step 6 entirely if no *fileable* items remain.** Fileable items are the `defer-as-issue` items plus any new Nice-to-Have findings appended by sub-step 5's re-review (prose-only findings are never appended and never fileable — see sub-step 2 and sub-step 5). Auto-applied `fix-now` items are already fixed and are not fileable. If both are empty there is nothing to file — skip the prompt and emit the Output-section verdict block (the schema under `## Output`, not the sub-step 6 template below). Skipping sub-step 6 does **not** exempt the auto-applied items from the verdict: they MUST still be listed in that block's `Deferred fixed in-session:` field, and any `note-only` items — from sub-step 2 or classified by the sub-step 5 re-review — MUST still be listed under `Deferred dropped:`. (This is the common case when every deferred item was `fix-now` or `note-only`: nothing is fileable and the run reaches Output with no prompt at all.)

Render the remaining unfixed items using the template below, then ask the question that follows. The render is REQUIRED regardless of prompt mechanism (markdown body, AskUserQuestion description, etc.) — do not collapse to a single sentence; assume the user is context-switching across parallel sessions and cannot scroll back to sub-step 3. Preserve original sub-step 3 numbering: auto-applied `fix-now` items are shown under "Auto-fixed in-session (for context)" with their original numbers (e.g., 1, 2), and the fileable `defer-as-issue` items keep theirs (e.g., 3, 4), with any new sub-step 5 re-review findings appended after. Omit a sub-group header entirely if empty; do not print "(none)".

**Every `<...>` token below is a substitution site** — replace each with the resolved value before emitting; never emit the literal pipe-separated schema (`<passed-clean | passed-after-fixes>`) to the user. The verdict header line should read e.g. `Quality review verdict: passed-after-fixes (cycles: 3)`. This is the canonical substitution rule other steps in this skill and `/start` point back to.

```text
Quality review verdict: <one of: passed-clean | passed-after-fixes>  (cycles: N)
Deferred items still unfixed after sub-step 5:

Auto-fixed in-session (for context, not actionable here):
  1. [Finding] — [file:line] — [tag]
  2. [Finding] — [file:line] — [tag]

Suggested defer as issue (recommended to file):
  3. [Finding] — [file:line] — [tag] — [rationale]
  4. [Finding] — [file:line] — [tag] — [rationale]

New Nice-to-Have findings from sub-step 5 re-review (appended, no group label):
  5. [Finding] — [file:line] — [tag] — [rationale]
```

Every actionable item MUST include: finding text (verbatim from reviewer, not paraphrased), file:line, tag, and rationale. If the reviewer emitted no file:line, render `file:line: unknown` rather than omitting the field. Then ask:

> For which of the unfixed items should I create Linear issues? Reply with comma-separated numbers (e.g., `3, 4`), `suggested` to file the defer-as-issue group, `all`, or `none`. Items declined here become `Deferred dropped` in the verdict block — they are not silently re-added to any other category.

**Auto mode:** do not ask — still render the grouped list (it is the audit trail), then proceed as if the user replied `suggested`. Filing the classifier's defer-as-issue group keeps discovered work flowing back into Linear for later `/auto` iterations without over-filing. If the state-name fallback below would need to ask the user, file into the team's default state instead and note the deviation in the verdict block — in an unattended run a re-statable issue beats a dropped finding.

Reply semantics:

- `suggested` → file every item still in the "Suggested defer as issue" group at this point (items already fixed in sub-step 5 are excluded automatically). If the remaining group is empty, treat as `none`.
- `all` → file every remaining unfixed item.
- `none` → file nothing; remaining items become `Deferred dropped` in the verdict block.
- Numeric list → file the listed numbers verbatim, **excluding any that reference the "Auto-fixed in-session" context group** — those items are already fixed and not fileable (the same exclusion `suggested` applies); silently skip such numbers rather than filing a redundant issue.

For each chosen item, create the issue and link its parent via `linear-create-child.sh` (it creates the issue, links the parent with `relations parent`, and **verifies the link** — `linear-cli issues create` has no `--parent` flag, and a bare `--data` `parentId` create sets the parent but never confirms it took, and a hand-rolled after-the-fact `issues update` is fragile: it can be skipped, silently fail, or orphan the new issue with no "Sub-issues" entry under the parent — see standards/linear-workflow.md "Spawned Issues Must Link to Their Parent"). Use `mktemp` for the body file so concurrent `/quality-review` runs in different sessions or worktrees do not race on a shared path. **macOS BSD `mktemp` does not replace `XXXXXX` if a suffix follows it**, so omit the extension on the template. Ensure `tmp/` exists first:

```bash
mkdir -p tmp
# 1. Write description to a unique tmp file. Body shape:
#    "<finding>\n\nLocation: <file:line>\n\nRationale: <rationale>"
body_file=$(mktemp tmp/deferred-XXXXXX)
# ...write body to "$body_file" via the Write tool...

# 2. Create the issue under the resolved parent (the helper links it + verifies).
#    --state Planned: deferred items have a known design intent and a documented
#    location/rationale (sub-step 1's consolidated list). They should not need
#    triage — they're triaged the moment we file them. Filing them into Triage
#    instead would queue them for re-evaluation that's already been done.
#    If no issue was resolved in Step 1, pass "-" as the parent (a top-level issue) —
#    do not invent a parent.
new_id=$(~/.claude/scripts/linear-create-child.sh <ISSUE-ID> <team> Planned "<short title>" "$body_file")
```

If `--state Planned` is rejected (the team uses different state names), follow this explicit fallback algorithm:

1. Derive the team key from the issue ID prefix (e.g., `PL-13` → team `PL`). Then probe: `linear-cli statuses list -t PL`.
2. Pick the first state whose name matches `/^(planned|backlog|to.?do)$/i` (case-insensitive, exact match — NOT a prefix match). **Deliberately exclude `ready` from this regex**: a prefix match on `ready` would latch onto `Ready For Release` or `Ready For Review` on teams that have those states, silently filing new deferred issues into a release/review state.
3. If none match, surface the available states to the user and ask which to use (`Available: Backlog, In Review, Done … which is the "ready-to-work, not-yet-prioritized" state for this team?`) rather than silently falling through to the team default — most teams default to `Triage`, which defeats the purpose of filing deferred items that are already triaged.

Do NOT silently fall through to the default.

After creation, verify the parent link took (`linear-cli issues get "$new_id" -o json | jq -r '.parent.identifier'` should print the parent's ID). If it did not, surface the failure rather than proceeding — an orphaned deferred issue defeats the purpose of filing it.

Items the user explicitly declined to file in this prompt go to `Deferred dropped`, **joining any `note-only` items — from sub-step 2 or classified by the sub-step 5 re-review** — record them all as one list for the verdict block. (Items that never reached this prompt because Step 6 terminated early in sub-step 5 are routed to `Open items` instead — see sub-step 5.)

## Output

When the skill returns to its caller (or to the user, when standalone), present a structured verdict block. The schema is:

```text
Verdict: <one of: passed-clean | passed-after-fixes | terminated-with-open-items | escalated-to-architect>
Cycles: N (initial + N-1 re-reviews)
Findings resolved: [list, or the bare word none if passed-clean]
Deferred fixed in-session: [list of items applied in-session, including auto-applied fix-now items even when sub-step 6 was skipped; or the bare word none]
Deferred filed as issues: [PL-XX, PL-YY (sub-issues of <PARENT>), or the bare word none]
Deferred dropped: [items intentionally not filed — note-only items auto-classified too minor to track, plus items the user explicitly declined in sub-step 6; list, or the bare word none]
Open items: [list, or the bare word none — populated only on terminated-with-open-items or escalated-to-architect; includes any deferred items not handled above]
```

**Substitute resolved values before rendering — never emit the schema verbatim.** The `Verdict:` line MUST contain exactly one of the four enum values, with no `|` separators and no remaining angle-bracket placeholders. A concrete passing example:

```text
Verdict: passed-after-fixes
Cycles: 3 (initial + 2 re-reviews)
Findings resolved: 2 (CRIT: null-pointer in handler; HIGH: race in retry loop)
Deferred fixed in-session: 1 (dead-code in spec_helper.rb)
Deferred filed as issues: PL-299, PL-300 (sub-issues of PL-190)
Deferred dropped: none
Open items: none
```

The persisted file (see "Persist the verdict" below) is parsed by `finish-read-verdict.sh`, which extracts the first whitespace-separated token after `Verdict:`. Writing the pipe-separated schema verbatim would silently produce `Verdict=passed-clean` downstream — the most permissive value — and bypass `/finish` Step 8's gate. The file MUST contain resolved values only.

The `(sub-issues of <PARENT>)` suffix is required when issues are filed and a parent issue was resolved in Step 1 — it gives the user a one-glance audit that the parent link from sub-step 6 was set. Omit the suffix only when no parent issue was resolved (in which case the newly-filed issues are intentionally not sub-issues).

When delegated from `/start`, this block becomes the "Adversarial review" section of the completion summary verbatim.

**Persist the verdict for `/finish`.** After the block is composed, also write it to a file so a later `/finish` run (potentially in a different session or a different worktree of the same repo) can find it. Skip this step entirely if no issue ID was resolved in Step 1.

1. Use the `Write` tool to save the resolved verdict block (every placeholder substituted; no `|`-separated schema lines) to `tmp/quality-review-verdict-<issue-id-lowercased>.md`. This is the same filename the persistence script will publish to both `tmp/` locations — staging and final artifact share one name so an LLM debugging the handoff doesn't have to follow a rename.
2. Persist atomically to both the current worktree's `tmp/` AND the main checkout's `tmp/` for cross-worktree handoff (the script reads the staging file and rewrites it in place at both locations):

   ```bash
   ~/.claude/scripts/quality-review-write-verdict.sh <ISSUE-ID> tmp/quality-review-verdict-<issue-id-lowercased>.md
   ```

The persisted file is the canonical `/quality-review` → `/finish` handoff. The contents are the verdict block verbatim — downstream readers (`/finish` Step 1.5) parse the `Verdict:` line and the `Open items:` list.

## Step 7: Session Reflection

After the verdict block is composed **and persisted** (the Output section above is fully complete), invoke `/reflect` in session mode as the **final action** of the run:

```text
Skill(skill: "reflect")   # session mode (no args)
```

This is the continuous-improvement tail: `/reflect` examines *this session's process* (which `/quality-review` itself never sees — it reviews the diff, not the thrashing, silently-worked-around skills, or stale config the session exposed) and turns generalizable friction into shared-config improvements. See `~/.claude/skills/reflect/SKILL.md`.

Rules for this step:

- **Runs exactly once**, here at the end — never per review cycle. The fix loop (Step 5) and deferred-items triage (Step 6) must have fully terminated first.
- **Runs regardless of verdict** — including `terminated-with-open-items` and `escalated-to-architect`. Those friction-heavy runs are the *highest*-value to reflect on. `/reflect`'s own detection gate keeps clean runs quiet (it emits `No improvements identified.` and returns cheaply), so this adds negligible cost to a smooth pass. **One exception:** a `terminated-with-open-items` verdict caused by main-checkout contamination inside this skill's own delegations (the `wt`-mode blockquote above Step 2) skips this step — a session with a known-broken write binding must not dispatch `/reflect`'s own auto-applied working-tree edits.
- **Does not touch the verdict or the lifecycle tag.** It runs after the verdict is persisted; it never re-opens, re-rates, or re-persists the verdict, and it emits no lifecycle tag. When `/quality-review` is delegated from `/start` Step 9, this completes before `/start` Step 10 renders the verdict and emits `READY-FOR-FINISH`, so the lifecycle-tag handoff is unaffected. Keep `/reflect`'s output compact so it never buries the verdict block.
- **No commit pollution.** `/reflect` only edits the working tree and never commits. User-level config edits land in the `~/.claude` repo (separate from the project repo). Project-level config edits stay uncommitted in the project tree and are surfaced by path; `/finish` stages issue files **by name** (never `git add -A`), so reflection's edits do not enter the issue commit — the user commits config changes deliberately.
- **Best-effort, non-blocking.** If `/reflect` is unavailable or errors, note it in one line and finish normally. Reflection failing must never block or alter the review outcome.

## Error Handling

- **`pnpm check` repeatedly fails** after multiple `developer` delegations (Step 2 gate): surface to the user with the failing output. Do not proceed to review.
- **Sub-step 5 corrective pass leaves `pnpm check` failing or regressions unaddressed**: the deferred-item fixes broke the application and the single corrective `developer` pass did not restore it. Set the run verdict to `terminated-with-open-items`, route per sub-step 5's verdict-population rules, and surface the failing output to the user along with the `Open items` list. Do not loop further or roll back automatically — let the user decide whether to revert, re-run `/quality-review`, or escalate to architect.
- **No changed files detected**: warn the user and exit. Nothing to review.
- **Issue ID provided but `linear-cli` not authenticated**: prompt `linear-cli auth oauth`, then continue without issue context if the user skips. Auto mode: do not prompt — continue without issue context immediately (the review still runs and the verdict still persists — the provided ID resolves locally without Linear auth, and persistence is local; only the requirements-conformance context is lost).
- **`quality-reviewer` agent returns malformed findings**: a response is malformed if ANY of the following hold:
  - Missing the `## Review Findings` heading.
  - Missing any of the five required subheadings (in order: `### Critical`, `### High`, `### Medium`, `### Nice-to-Have`, `### Approved`). Match by line-prefix with a narrow tail: the heading word(s) must be followed by either end-of-line OR ` (` (single space + opening paren, for the optional parenthetical like `(must fix before done)` or `(auto-fix lane)`). Examples that match: `### Critical`, `### Critical (must fix before done)`, `### Nice-to-Have (auto-fix lane)`. Examples that do NOT match (treated as malformed under criterion 4 below): `### Critical findings`, `### Critical:`, `### CRITICAL`, `### Nice-to-Have / Out-of-Scope` (the pre-rename heading — a stale agent emitting it must be re-spawned onto the current contract). Subheadings appearing out of order also count as malformed (downstream consumers scan positionally).
  - Contains a JSON array of findings (`[{...}, {...}]`) in ANY form — including as an appendix alongside the required headings, not only "instead of" them.
  - Uses non-standard headings ("Verification summary", "Categorization", "Final findings", or any other heading not in the Required findings format).
  - Contains free-form prose between or around the required sections (preamble before `## Review Findings`, appendix after `### Approved`, or commentary between subheadings).

    EXCEPTION — preamble-only: if the ONLY deviation is prose before `## Review Findings` (the five-section block complete and in order, and no other malformed criterion firing), do not re-spawn. Instead scan the preamble for findings-like assertions absent from the block: if none, accept the block (discard the preamble from downstream parsing) and emit a one-line chat note recording the deviation; if any, treat the response as malformed and follow the standard On detection path below. On accept, surface the discarded preamble verbatim alongside the note (mirroring On detection step 1's surface-the-raw-output rule) so a scan false-negative remains recoverable by the user rather than silently lost.

  On detection:
  1. Surface the raw agent output to the user (so the work isn't lost).
  2. Re-spawn the agent ONCE with a corrective prompt prepended: `Your previous response did not follow the Required findings format from your system prompt. Your entire response MUST consist of ONLY the Required structure: ## Review Findings heading, then exactly five ### subheadings in the prescribed order (Critical, High, Medium, Nice-to-Have, Approved), each followed by bullet items or the literal "- None". Do NOT emit JSON arrays, JSON objects, or any other non-markdown structure. Do NOT emit tables, alternative section headings, instructional NOTE bullets, preamble, appendix, or prose between sections — markdown bullets only.`
  3. Route the re-spawn's outcome:
     - **Re-spawn produced a well-formed response** → continue normally with its findings.
     - **Re-spawn still malformed** → terminate `/quality-review` with the verdict body below.
     - **Re-spawn failed to return at all** (subagent crashed, infrastructure error, timeout) → route to the agent-unavailable branch below (use its verdict body).

  **Verdict body for malformed-fallthrough** (write this verbatim to the staging file before calling `quality-review-write-verdict.sh`; all seven Output schema fields populated so `/finish` Step 4 has consistent shape to template):

  ```text
  Verdict: terminated-with-open-items
  Cycles: 1 (initial review malformed; one corrective re-spawn also malformed)
  Findings resolved: none
  Deferred fixed in-session: none
  Deferred filed as issues: none
  Deferred dropped: none
  Open items: agent output malformed across two attempts; manual review required (see chat above for raw outputs)
  ```

- **`quality-reviewer` agent unavailable** (subagent type missing, infrastructure error, or re-spawn from the malformed branch failed to return): surface the failure to the user. Terminate with one of the two verdict bodies below — pick by route, write the chosen body verbatim with no further substitution.

  **Route A — initial spawn returned unavailable** (no cycles ran):

  ```text
  Verdict: terminated-with-open-items
  Cycles: 0
  Findings resolved: none
  Deferred fixed in-session: none
  Deferred filed as issues: none
  Deferred dropped: none
  Open items: review could not run; quality-reviewer agent unavailable on initial spawn (see chat above for failure details)
  ```

  **Route B — re-spawn from the malformed branch returned unavailable** (one malformed cycle ran):

  ```text
  Verdict: terminated-with-open-items
  Cycles: 1
  Findings resolved: none
  Deferred fixed in-session: none
  Deferred filed as issues: none
  Deferred dropped: none
  Open items: review could not run; initial output was malformed and the corrective re-spawn returned unavailable (see chat above for failure details)
  ```

- **`quality-review-write-verdict.sh` itself fails** (disk full, perms, mktemp/mv error, missing `tmp/` parent unreachable): the persistence layer cannot record the verdict, so `/finish` Step 1.5 would see `VERDICT=none-found` and proceed with only a warning — defeating the gate that the fallthrough verdict was meant to establish. On detection (script exit code non-zero):
  1. Surface the script's stderr to the user immediately.
  2. Do NOT silently proceed. Print an explicit warning: `WARNING: /quality-review verdict could not be persisted (see above). /finish for this issue will not be gated by this verdict. Either resolve the persistence failure and re-run /quality-review, or run /finish with explicit awareness that Step 8's gate cannot read the verdict you just produced.`
  3. Continue with the in-memory verdict (still surface the verdict block to the user / caller) so `/start` Step 10 has something to render, but understand that `/finish` cannot enforce it. The user must decide whether to re-run or proceed manually.
