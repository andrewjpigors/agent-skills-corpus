# fw-build

Generated wrapper skill for the curated gstack + Superpowers workflow.

## Stage Contract

- Stage: build
- Owner: codex-orchestrator
- Role: Core
- Primary method: superpowers
- Methods: superpowers
- Contract: Execute implementation discipline with worktree, TDD, plan execution, and verification practices.

## Inputs

- Approved implementation plan that links to its spec, repository context, and verification expectations.

## Outputs

- Scoped code changes, tests, verification evidence, and remaining risks.

## Required References

  - Read active materialization: `../../references/upstreams/superpowers/commits/6fd4507659784c351abbd2bc264c7162cfd386dc/skills/using-git-worktrees/SKILL.md`

## Conditional References

- None

## Suppressed Routes

- None


## Policy Notes

- Superpowers subagent-driven instructions define implementation discipline only; Codex host policy controls whether agents can be spawned.
- fw-build consumes the approved plan and uses its linked spec as the scope-compliance source.

## Execution Rules

- Read this wrapper first, then read every required reference listed above before acting.
- Read conditional references only when the user request reaches that gate.
- If an active upstream materialization is unavailable, report that the wrapper is blocked on upstream sync instead of guessing from installed skills.
- Treat installed skills as callable surfaces, not source-of-truth project documentation.
- Keep one execution owner for the current task.
