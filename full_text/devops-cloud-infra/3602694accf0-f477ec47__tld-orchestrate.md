name: tld-orchestrate
description: |
  Config-driven pipeline runner — read the `pipelines:` config from `.tld/campaign.md`, resolve the
  current ticket's type against the cascade (team standard → project override → type override), and
  drive each step's TLD skill in order, handling every outcome (done / failed / blocked / needs_user),
  the `stop_after` review pause, per-step retries with a circuit breaker, and resume-from-where-it-stopped.
  Use this skill whenever the user says "tld-orchestrate", "orchestrate", "run the pipeline", "run the
  configured pipeline", "drive this ticket by config", or wants ONE ticket taken through whatever step
  sequence the project configured (instead of the fixed sequence /tld-full-auto hard-codes). Optional
  argument: a ticket ID passed through to the first step (e.g. /tld-orchestrate DROSS-19); with no
  argument the first step (/tld-setup) discovers the next ticket. This is the Claude pipeline runner of
  the dual-runtime workflow: it is ADDITIVE and reads the same per-type config Matt's Codex path will
  read later. It never invents flow — the config decides which steps run, which agent, and where it
  pauses. For the fixed, non-configurable leaf flow use /tld-full-auto; for the two-gate version use
  /tld-partial-auto.

# TLD Orchestrate — the config-driven pipeline runner

Drive **one** ticket through the step sequence its **type** resolves to in the project's `pipelines:`
config. This skill is an **aggregator**: every step is a TLD skill formally invoked via the Skill tool,
and this skill re-implements none of them. What it owns is the *control flow* around them — reading the
config, resolving the per-type pipeline, invoking each step in order, and acting on each step's outcome
(advance, retry-then-fail, stop-and-record, or escalate).

The contract, in one line: **read the config, resolve the pipeline for this ticket's type, invoke each
step's skill in order, route on its outcome, honor `stop_after`, break the circuit after N failed fix
attempts, and leave every stop resumable — never restart from the top.**

## Where this sits (dual-runtime)

This is the **Claude pipeline runner** from the dual-runtime plan (Phase 3). It is purely additive:

- It is a **new Claude skill**. It changes nothing in the Codex `skills/` folder, no `CODEX_*` names, no
  `~/.codex` paths. Matt's flows are untouched.
- It reads the **same per-type pipeline config** the Codex path will read later, so a project's flow is
  defined once and both agents honor it.
- Where a project has **no** `pipelines:` config at all, the built-in **team-standard default** (the leaf
  flow below) applies, so existing campaigns keep working unchanged.

**Not the same as `/tld-full-auto`.** Full-auto hard-codes one leaf sequence
(setup → write-tests → build → audit → run-test) and always stops before commit. This skill runs
**whatever the config says** — a different sequence per project or per ticket type, with configurable
pause points and a configurable commit/write-up/next tail. If the config is just the standard leaf
pipeline and you want the fixed behavior, `/tld-full-auto` is the simpler tool.

## When to use this

- One ticket, driven end to end by the project's configured pipeline rather than a fixed sequence.
- A project whose flow differs from the default (extra steps, a pause after tests, a different tail).
- You want outcome routing (retry-then-fail, stop-and-record-blocker, escalate-needs-user) instead of
  full-auto's "stop on anything not perfectly clean."

Trigger phrases: `tld-orchestrate`, `orchestrate`, "run the pipeline", "run the configured pipeline",
"drive this ticket by config".

## Inputs

What the user provides:
- Optionally a ticket ID (e.g. `/tld-orchestrate DROSS-19`) — passed through **verbatim** to the first
  step (`/tld-setup`). With no argument, the first step discovers the next ticket.
- Nothing else — the flow comes from the config, the ticket details come from the sub-skills.

What you read on your own:
- `.tld/campaign.md` — the four standard sections **plus** the optional `## Pipelines` section (below).
- Everything else comes from the sub-skills' own outputs.

## Process

### 0. Preflight

#### 0.1 Load project config

Read `.tld/campaign.md` from the current repo root.
If the file does not exist, stop and output:
  "No campaign found in this repo. Run /campaign-init to scaffold one."
  Do not proceed. Do not attempt to resolve project config from any other source.
Parse the four sections: Project, Test Commands, Stack, Commit format.
If any required field in Project (Issue tracker, Project name, Team, Ticket prefix) is missing, stop and output:
  "Campaign file is missing required Project field: {field}. Run /campaign-edit to fix."
The tracker, team, prefix, and project name from this block are the only ones the skill uses for the rest of this run.

**Tracker resolution:**

This skill's ticket and milestone operations are written using Linear MCP tool names (`get_issue`, `save_issue`, `list_milestones`, and so on). Resolve every such operation against the tracker named in `.tld/campaign.md` → Project → Issue tracker:

- **Linear** — call the Linear MCP tools directly, as written in this skill. Contract: docs/ADAPTERS.md.
- **Jira** — perform the equivalent operation per docs/JIRA.md instead (milestone = Story, ticket = Sub-task, order = rank, status by category, status changes via workflow transitions). docs/JIRA.md § Tool-name map is the 1:1 lookup.
- **Any other tracker** — stop and output:
    "Issue tracker '{tracker}' is not supported by the TLD skills. Supported: Linear, Jira. See LIMITATIONS.md."
  Do not invent an adapter.

**Comment operation.** This skill posts ticket comments of its own (the blocker/needs_user records in §5). The canonical Tracker-resolution block does not name a comment tool, so resolve it explicitly: on **Linear** use the comment-create call; on **Jira** use `addCommentToJiraIssue`.

#### 0.2 Local DB safety check

**Run the local-DB safety check before any test command or destructive database operation.**

Read `Stack.Database` from `.tld/campaign.md` — this names the expected local instance (e.g., `Supabase local at 127.0.0.1:54321`).

Verify the live database connection also points at local:
1. Scan the repo for database URL references (Supabase config, `.env*`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`, or equivalent for this project's stack).
2. If any reference names a non-local host (anything that is not `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`), **HARD ABORT immediately**:

```
🛑 ABORT: Non-local database detected.

Found: [the URL/host that's not local]
Location: [where you found it]
Campaign Stack.Database: [value from campaign.md]

This skill runs tests or destructive operations against the database.
Refusing to proceed against a non-local database.

Fix: Ensure the configured database URL points at local (matches Stack.Database).
```

Do not proceed. Do not run any tests. Do not run any commands. Stop completely.

#### 0.3 Record pre-existing worktree state

Run `git status --porcelain` and record every already-dirty path. These paths are **not part of this run**. After the first step loads the ticket, if any pre-existing dirty path overlaps the ticket's "Files to Create/Modify," STOP — the runner cannot separate prior edits from this run's work in the same file. The configured `Changelog path` is a known exception the commit step will stage; if it is among the pre-existing dirty paths, STOP before invoking any step.

### 1. Read the pipeline config

The pipeline config lives in an optional `## Pipelines` section of `.tld/campaign.md`, holding a fenced
`yaml` block — a map of pipelines keyed by ticket type. It is **local overrides only**; anything the
project does not override falls back to the built-in team standard in §2. Example:

```yaml
pipelines:
  default:                 # leaf; anything unlisted inherits this
    - skill: tld-setup
    - skill: tld-write-tests
    - skill: tld-build
    - skill: tld-audit
    - skill: tld-run-test
    - skill: tld-commit
    - skill: tld-writeup
    - skill: tld-next
  bug:     { use: default }
  subtask: { use: default }

  story:                   # container; fires when children are done
    trigger: all_children_done
    steps:
      - skill: tld-gate
      - skill: tld-story-review
      - skill: tld-spot-check
```

Per-step keys the runner honors:

| Key | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `skill:` | The TLD skill to invoke for this step (required) | — |
| `stop_after:` | `true` → pause for human review after this step succeeds | `false` |
| `on_fail:` | Which skill to invoke to fix a `failed` outcome | `tld-align` |
| `retries:` | How many `on_fail` attempts before the circuit breaks | `2` |

If `.tld/campaign.md` has **no** `## Pipelines` section, use the team standard resolved in §2 (the shared
team-standard file, else the built-in default) as-is. Do **not** stop for a missing config — its absence
means "use the standard," which is the common case.

### 2. Resolve this ticket's pipeline (the cascade)

Resolution is four layers, base to most-specific, and nothing is ever undefined — everything falls back toward the base:

```
shared team-standard file  →  built-in default (fallback)  →  project override (## Pipelines)  →  type override
```

**The team standard** is the base of the cascade. It lives in a shared file installed into each agent home so the Codex and Claude paths cannot drift (see docs/CAMPAIGN_SCHEMA.md § cascade):

- Read `$WORKFLOW_SHARE_DIR/pipelines/team-standard.yaml` (neutral `WORKFLOW_*`, falling back to `CODEX_*`). If present, its `pipelines:` map is the team standard.
- If that file is not installed — it ships via the shared `install.sh` (DROSS-23) — fall back to the **built-in default** below. Until the shared file lands, this fallback *is* the team standard and behavior is exactly as today.

**The built-in default** (the fallback team standard, used whenever neither the shared file nor the project overrides it) is the leaf pipeline:

```
tld-setup → tld-write-tests → tld-build → tld-audit → tld-run-test → tld-commit → tld-writeup → tld-next
```

Resolve as follows:

1. **Determine the ticket's type.** Read the ticket (the first step will load it in full; for resolution
   you only need its issue type). Map the type to a flow shape:
   - **Leaf** — Sub-task, Bug, Task → pipeline key `default` (or the type's own key if the config defines one).
   - **Container** — Story, Epic → pipeline key `story` / `epic`. See §3 — container flows are not shipped yet.
2. **Look up the key** in the resolved config (project override merged over the built-in standard):
   - Key present with `use: X` → resolve to pipeline `X` (follow one level of indirection).
   - Key present with an explicit step list (or `steps:` under a `trigger:`) → use it.
   - Key absent → fall back to `default`.
   - `default` absent from the project config → fall back to the **team standard** above (shared file, else built-in default).
3. The result is an **ordered list of steps**. That list is the pipeline for this run.

This resolved step list is the single source of truth for the rest of the run. §3.5 seeds the shared
checklist from it, so the per-step gates and the orchestrator's done-signal match the configured flow
exactly.

### 3. Container guard (leaf ships first)

If the resolved pipeline is a **container** flow (type Story/Epic, or a config entry with a `trigger:`),
STOP with a clear message:

```
Container pipelines (Story/Epic closeout) are not driven end to end yet.

The closeout skills exist — tld-gate, tld-story-review, tld-spot-check — but this runner
does not yet do the container fan-out (wait for all children, then gate → review →
spot-check). This ticket resolves to a container flow ({type}), so there is nothing to
drive here yet.

Run /tld-orchestrate against a leaf ticket (Sub-task / Bug / Task); or, for a Story that
is ready to close out, invoke the closeout skills directly by key:
/tld-gate {storyKey}, then /tld-story-review {storyKey}, then /tld-spot-check {storyKey}.
```

Do not attempt the container fan-out from this runner yet. (A configured step whose skill is genuinely
not installed is a different event — a HARD STOP under §4's invocation rule.)

### 3.5 Seed the shared checklist from the resolved steps

Before driving any step, seed the shared `agent-checklist` from the resolved step list so the checklist
mirrors the configured flow one-section-per-step. This is what lets a `stop_after`/`blocked`/`needs_user`
stop resume from the right place (§7) and what lets the orchestrator read "this ticket is done" off the
shared database rather than re-deriving it.

**The seam.** The runner owns the config; the engine owns the checklist. The runner reads `pipelines:`
from `.tld/campaign.md` (§1–§2), turns the resolved steps into a JSON array, and hands that array to the
engine through the **`WORKFLOW_PIPELINE_STEPS`** environment variable at `init` time. **The engine never
reads `campaign.md`** — it only consumes the array it is given. This keeps the config-parsing in one place
(here) and the checklist-writing in one place (the engine).

**How to seed:**

1. Build the JSON array from the resolved steps, in order — each element the step's skill name:

   ```json
   ["tld-setup","tld-write-tests","tld-build","tld-audit","tld-run-test","tld-commit","tld-writeup","tld-next"]
   ```

   (Elements may also be `{"skill": "..."}` objects; the engine accepts either. A bare skill-name string
   is the simplest form and what this skill emits.)

2. Initialize the checklist with that array set on the environment, keyed to this run:

   ```
   WORKFLOW_PIPELINE_STEPS='<the JSON array>' \
     agent-checklist init --type dev --thread-id <session-id> --slug <ticket-key> --repo <repo-root>
   ```

   - `--thread-id` is the run's **session id** — the same ownership stamp the orchestrator uses to know
     which run owns the ticket. Use the current session id.
   - `--slug` is the ticket key (e.g. `dross-19`), lowercased to a valid slug.
   - `--repo` is the repo root.
   - `--type dev` supplies a required template type; with `WORKFLOW_PIPELINE_STEPS` set, the engine
     replaces the fixed template's sections/items with **one section and one status item per step**
     (label = skill name, order preserved), so the `--type` value only satisfies the required flag.

   With the env var **unset**, `init` produces the fixed Codex template byte-identical — so this opt-in is
   additive and never disturbs Matt's path.

3. The engine writes one status item per step, keyed `<sanitized-skill>_step` — the skill name lowercased
   with every run of non-alphanumeric characters collapsed to `_` (e.g. `tld-setup` → item key
   `tld_setup_step`, `tld-run-test` → `tld_run_test_step`). Those keys are how §4 checks each step off and
   how §7 finds the resume point. Duplicate skill names get a numeric suffix (`_2`).

If the installed `agent-checklist` does not support `WORKFLOW_PIPELINE_STEPS` yet (see Limitations), this
seed step is a no-op fallback: proceed to drive the steps, and use the §7 `save-point`-style resume
instead of the seeded step-state. Do not fail the run just because the engine capability is not installed.

### 4. Drive the steps

Walk the resolved step list **in order**. For each step:

1. **Formally invoke the step's skill via the Skill tool** — with the user's ticket-ID argument on the
   first step if one was given, no argument otherwise. Never inline a step's logic instead of invoking
   its skill. Never reorder. A skill that genuinely *has nothing to do* still runs and returns output
   saying so — **silent skipping is failure.** A skill that **cannot be invoked at all** (missing / not
   installed, the Skill-tool call errors, or it returns no output) is a **HARD STOP** — never treat an
   empty or failed invocation as "nothing to do," and never proceed past it.
2. **Show the step's output.**
3. **Determine the step's outcome** (§5) and route on it.
4. On `done`: **mark the step's checklist item done** — `agent-checklist check --key <sanitized-skill>_step`
   (the key from §3.5, e.g. `tld_build_step`). This is what advances the shared done-signal the orchestrator
   reads. Then, if the step has `stop_after: true` **or the step ended at its own human-approval gate**, go
   to §6 (pause); otherwise advance to the next step.

**Claim the ticket after the first step (required for the chain to hold).** The first step (`tld-setup`)
marks the ticket **In Progress** but does **not** assign it. Every later step resolves "the current ticket"
as *the single ticket that is In Progress **and assigned to me*** (see the Step-chaining contract below).
So the moment the first step has identified the active ticket, **assign it to the current user** if it is
not already — on Linear via `save_issue` (assignee = me), on Jira via `editJiraIssue` (or `assignJiraIssue`)
to the current `accountId` from `atlassianUserInfo`. This is also the ownership stamp the orchestrator's
claim uses (set-only-if-empty). Skip this only if the ticket is already assigned to the current user. If
the claim is not made, the second step will resolve **zero** In-Progress-assigned-to-me tickets and stop
with "No In-Progress ticket found," breaking the chain mid-run.

When the last step returns `done` and its item is checked, the pipeline is complete — every step item in
the checklist reads `done`, which is the orchestrator's "ticket done" signal — go to §7 (report).

### 5. Outcome routing

Each step reports one of four outcomes. The vocabulary matches the checklist engine
(`done` / `failed` / `blocked` / `needs_user`).

**How to read a step's outcome.** The TLD sub-skills end at a "What's next?" block rather than printing a
literal outcome word, so infer the outcome from what the step surfaced (the same interpretation
`/tld-full-auto` uses):

| Outcome | How a step signals it | Runner behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **done** | Ends on a clean go-forward gate — RED confirmed, GREEN build, audit LOW/none, tests+drift clean, commit landed. Once `tld-writeup` has run, its `handoff_state: done` in the write-up is the authoritative signal. | Advance to the next step (or pause if `stop_after`). |
| **failed** | Ran but couldn't pass — tests red, build stuck at its retry cap, drift detected, or a remediation gate in slot 1 (`/tld-align`). `handoff_state: failed`. | Route to the fix step — see the circuit breaker below. |
| **blocked** | An external thing is missing — creds, a service, a dependency, tracker unreachable, non-local DB. `handoff_state: blocked`. | STOP. Record the blocker (below). Leave resumable. |
| **needs_user** | A genuine human decision — a step raises an interactive `AskUserQuestion` that is not a routine forward gate, or asks the spec/tests be changed. `handoff_state: needs_user`. | Escalate (below). Do not auto-answer. |

Distinguishing a **routine forward gate** (which is `done`) from a **remediation gate** (which is
`failed`/`needs_user`): identify the go-forward option by **meaning**, not slot number. Several sub-skills
put a *remediation* in slot 1 (`/tld-build` retry-cap → `/tld-align`; `/tld-write-tests` passing-during-RED
→ "Investigate"; `/tld-audit` HIGH/MEDIUM → "Fix the findings"). A step whose slot 1 is a remediation has
**not** reached a clean result — treat it as `failed`, not as an approved advance.

**failed → circuit breaker.** When a step is `failed`:
1. Invoke its `on_fail` skill (default `tld-align`) via the Skill tool. Show its output.
2. Re-invoke the failed step.
3. If it is now `done`, advance (and note the fix cycle in the report).
4. Count the attempts. After `retries` failed fix attempts on the **same** step (default 2), **the circuit
   breaks**: STOP as `failed` rather than looping and burning tokens. Report which step broke and the last
   failing output verbatim.

**If the fix step (`tld-align`) proposes changing tests rather than implementation → STOP as `needs_user`.**
Changing the spec to match the code is always a human decision.

**blocked → record and stop.** Post a standardized blocker comment on the active ticket (via the comment
operation from §0.1): what is missing and the exact thing needed. Then STOP — the pipeline is resumable
from this step once the blocker clears. Do not revert or clean up the worktree.

**needs_user → escalate, park, stop.** Post the standardized record on the ticket: the blocker and the
**exact question** the human must answer. Then STOP the pipeline, parked and resumable from this step.

> The full `needs_user` escalation — push the question to the phone, park the ticket with a wait deadline,
> and keep working *other* tickets while it waits — is the **orchestrator's** job (Phase 5), because it
> spans more than one ticket and one session. This single-ticket skill's responsibility is to **record the
> question on the ticket and stop cleanly and resumably.** It never silently drops the question, and it
> never guesses the answer.

**A step's own human-approval gate is a pause, not an outcome to auto-clear.** Some steps end at a
**mandatory human-approval gate** even on a clean result — `tld-commit` ("No commit happens without the
user's explicit approval") and `tld-run-test`'s commit gate. This is **not** a `done` the runner may
advance past, and **not** a `failed`/`needs_user` problem: the work is fine, but landing it is the human's
call, always (the whole TLD family keeps the human in control of the landing). When a step ends at its own
approval gate, treat it exactly like `stop_after`: mark the step's checklist item done for the work it
finished, then **pause and hand the gate to the user** (§6). Never type the approval keyword yourself,
never reach around the step to `git commit`, and never mark the ticket Done on the step's behalf. The
pipeline resumes from the next step once the user has approved and the step has landed its work.

> **Why the "runs straight through, no pauses" pipeline still pauses at commit.** The spec's recommended
> leaf pipeline ends `… tld-commit → tld-writeup → tld-next`. `tld-commit`'s approval gate means an
> unattended run **cannot** silently commit through it — the commit step is inherently human-gated. A
> project that truly wants no pause at the landing must say so out of band (a pre-approved commit mode);
> absent that, the runner stops at the commit gate and lets the human land it, then resumes into
> `tld-writeup` and `tld-next`.

### 6. Pause for human review (`stop_after` and approval gates)

Pause when **either** a step that completed `done` has `stop_after: true`, **or** a step ended at its own
mandatory human-approval gate (§5). Do **not** advance. Present:

```
## ⏸ Pipeline paused after {step-skill} — {ticket}

{the step's own output / result summary — including its approval gate verbatim, if it has one}

Steps done:      {list}
Paused after:    {step-skill}  ({stop_after | awaiting your approval to land})
Remaining steps: {list}

Review the result above. {If the step has an approval gate: approve it there to land the work.}
To continue, run /tld-orchestrate again — it resumes from the next step.
```

Then STOP the turn. This is the per-project lifecycle: some projects run straight through, others pause
after tests or before commit — from the `stop_after` flags — and the landing gates (`tld-commit`) always
pause regardless, so the human owns every commit.

### 7. Resume (resumable, never restart)

A stopped pipeline — `blocked`, `needs_user`, a broken circuit, or a `stop_after` pause — resumes from
**where it stopped**, never from the top. On a fresh `/tld-orchestrate` invocation:

1. Re-run preflight (§0) and re-resolve the pipeline (§1–§2) for the same ticket.
2. Determine the **resume point** — the first step not yet `done`.
3. Continue driving from that step (§4).

**Where the resume point comes from.** The durable record of "which steps are done" is the shared
`agent-checklist` seeded in §3.5. Read it back for this run (same `--thread-id` session id and `--slug`
ticket key) and take the **first step item whose status is not `done`** as the resume point — that is the
step the prior run stopped on. Re-seeding is not needed: `agent-checklist init` refuses to overwrite an
existing checklist, so on resume you skip the seed and read the existing one.

**Fallback when the engine capability is not installed.** If the installed `agent-checklist` does not
support `WORKFLOW_PIPELINE_STEPS` (see Limitations), there is no seeded step-state to read. Fall back to
determining the resume point the way `/tld-save-point` does — by re-reading the ticket status, the git
worktree state, and any `tld-writeup` handoff already posted — and ask the user to confirm the resume step
if it is ambiguous.

Either way: do not re-run a step that has already landed its work (a second `tld-build` over a finished
worktree, a second `tld-commit`); when unsure whether a step already ran, ask rather than repeat it.

### 8. Report

On completion (last step `done`), output:

```
## ✅ Pipeline complete — {ticket} — {title}

| # | Step | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | {skill} | ✅ done |
| … | … | … |

Fix cycles used: {step: n, or "none"}
Recorded on ticket: {blocker/needs_user notes posted, or "none"}
```

For a stop (`blocked` / `needs_user` / broken circuit), output instead:

```
## 🛑 Pipeline stopped at {step} — {ticket}

| # | Step | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| … | {completed} | ✅ done |
| n | {stopping step} | ⛔ {failed | blocked | needs_user} — {one-line reason} |
| … | {remaining} | ⏭ not reached |

**Why:** {the finding/failure/question, verbatim from the step's output}
**Recorded:** {the ticket comment posted, or "none"}
**Worktree:** {uncommitted files left in place — nothing reverted}
**Resume:** run /tld-orchestrate again — it resumes from {step}.
```

## Step-chaining contract (verified)

The TLD leaf skills were built to chain, and they chain cleanly as pipeline steps — verified by
read-through of `tld-setup`, `tld-write-tests`, `tld-build`, `tld-audit`, `tld-run-test`, `tld-commit`,
and `tld-next`. What makes them safe to invoke as **independent** Skill-tool calls is that **context does
not pass through the conversation** — every step reconstructs its own context from durable state. Three
channels carry the handoff:

| Channel | What it carries | Who writes it / reads it |
|---|---|---|
| **Tracker status** | Which ticket is active | `tld-setup` sets **In Progress** at the front; the middle steps resolve *the single ticket In Progress **and assigned to me***; `tld-next` transitions it to **Done** at the back |
| **Git worktree** | The actual work | Uncommitted changes and commits flow build → run-test → commit; `tld-next` confirms the commit exists |
| **Shared session** | Loaded ticket context | `tld-audit` uses in-conversation context first, tracker as fallback — both are present because the runner drives every step in one session |

Two preconditions fall out of that contract, and the runner enforces both:

1. **Self-assignment (§4 claim).** The middle steps key on "In Progress **and assigned to me**," but
   `tld-setup` only sets In Progress — it never assigns. The runner assigns the ticket to the current user
   right after the first step identifies it; without that, the second step resolves zero tickets and the
   chain breaks. (This is Linear-first behavior that bites the Jira adapter, where sub-tasks are often
   unassigned.)
2. **Landing gates stay human (§5–§6).** `tld-commit` and `tld-run-test` end at a mandatory approval gate
   by design. The runner treats those as pauses and hands them to the user — it never auto-approves a
   commit or marks the ticket Done on a step's behalf.

Blocker signalling is likewise readable off the step's terminal gate: `tld-setup` prints
`Blocked — {id} is {status}`; build/commit end at a `/tld-align` remediation gate; audit gates on its
CHECK category; run-test gates on red/drift; a non-local DB hard-aborts. §5's "read the outcome by
meaning" routing consumes exactly these shapes. The durable, machine-readable `handoff_state` record is
written by `tld-writeup` (DROSS-1); until that step runs, per-step outcomes come from interpreting each
step's gate.

## Guardrails

- **Additive only.** This skill adds a Claude path; it never changes Codex behavior, `CODEX_*` names, or
  the Codex `skills/` folder.
- **The config decides the flow, not this skill.** Never add, drop, or reorder steps beyond what the
  resolved pipeline says. If the flow is wrong, fix the config, not the run.
- **No step's logic is inlined.** Every step is a formal Skill-tool invocation; a failed or empty
  invocation is a HARD STOP, never "nothing to do."
- **The runner does not itself commit, push, PR, or mark Done.** Those happen only if the configured
  pipeline includes the step that does them (`tld-commit`, `tld-next`), invoked as steps — and each of
  those keeps its own approval gate. The runner never reaches around a step to land work.
- **Never run destructive database commands.** The §0.2 check enforces local-only; treat any ambiguity as
  a stop.
- **Every stop is resumable and non-destructive.** On any stop, leave the worktree exactly as it is — no
  resets, no reverts, no cleanup.

## Limitations (read before claiming an end-to-end run)

- **Checklist seeding is wired here, but gated on the engine being installed.** §3.5 seeds the shared
  checklist and §4/§7 read and check it off, all through the engine capability **`WORKFLOW_PIPELINE_STEPS`**
  (`agent-checklist` accepting a JSON step array at `init`). That capability currently exists only on the
  unmerged workflow-tools branch `claude/codex-tools-claude-review-4f9de5`; the installed `agent-checklist`
  does not have it yet. Until that engine work is merged and reinstalled (or `install.sh` is run from that
  branch), the seed step is a no-op fallback: the skill still drives steps and routes outcomes correctly,
  but **resume falls back to the `/tld-save-point`-style re-read of ticket + git state** (§7) rather than the
  durable seeded step-state. Do not claim a fully checklist-driven end-to-end run until that capability is
  installed — it cannot be exercised end-to-end against the currently-installed engine.
- **Container fan-out is a follow-up.** The closeout skills (`tld-gate`, `tld-story-review`, `tld-spot-check`)
  all exist and are invocable directly by Story key, but this runner still stops at §3 for a container flow —
  it does not yet wait on all children and drive `gate → review → spot-check` automatically.
- **Shared team-standard file is not installed yet.** §2 reads `$WORKFLOW_SHARE_DIR/pipelines/team-standard.yaml`
  as the base of the cascade, but that file ships via the shared `install.sh` (DROSS-23), which has not landed.
  Until it does, the base layer falls back to the **built-in default** in §2, so behavior is exactly as today.
  The campaign schema for the sections read here is docs/CAMPAIGN_SCHEMA.md (DROSS-35).
- **`tld-writeup` is a sibling ticket (DROSS-1).** The `handoff_state` signal this skill reads as the
  authoritative per-step outcome is written by `tld-writeup`; until that skill is present, outcome
  detection relies on interpreting each step's "What's next?" gate.

### Numbered shortcut recognition

When you present the "What's next?" options at the end of your output, the user may respond with just a number (e.g., "1" or "2"). If the user's next message is a bare number matching one of the options you presented, treat it as if they typed the corresponding slash command and invoke that skill immediately.
