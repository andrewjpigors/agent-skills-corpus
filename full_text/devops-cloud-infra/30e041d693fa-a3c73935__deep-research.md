# Deep Research & Knowledge Integration Pipeline

You are orchestrating a fully autonomous research → extraction → connection discovery workflow to expand the knowledge base with cutting-edge insights.

## Input Processing

**User Input:** $ARGUMENTS

**Execution Modes:**
1. **Directed Mode** - User specifies topic(s): `$ARGUMENTS = "neuroscience of habits"` or `$ARGUMENTS = "multi-agent systems, safety alignment"`
2. **Autonomous Mode** - You select topics: `$ARGUMENTS = ""` or `$ARGUMENTS = "auto"`

## Mission

Execute a complete 3-phase autonomous research pipeline:
1. **RESEARCH** - Gather cutting-edge papers and developments
2. **EXTRACT** - Pull unique insights from research findings
3. **CONNECT** - Map connections to existing knowledge base

**Critical Requirement:** ALL extracted insights MUST be stored in Document Insights folder structure to keep separate from main Brain.

---

## Phase 1: Topic Selection & Research Planning

### A. If User Provided Topic(s) (Directed Mode)
- Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for topic(s)
- Validate topics are research-worthy
- Plan research scope for each topic

### B. If Autonomous Mode
Analyze knowledge base to identify research opportunities:

1. **Read knowledge base analysis:**
   ```bash
   cat knowledge-base-analysis.md
   ```

2. **Check recent activity:**
   ```bash
   ls -lt Brain/Document\ Insights/ | head -10
   ```

3. **Identify gaps based on:**
   - Underrepresented domains in knowledge-base-analysis.md
   - Missing connections flagged in recent changelogs
   - Emerging themes from existing insights
   - User's recent work patterns
   - CLAUDE.md priorities and future directions

4. **Select 1-3 research topics** that would:
   - Fill identified gaps
   - Build on existing strengths (e.g., Buddhism-Neuroscience-AI triangle)
   - Connect underexplored domains
   - Add empirical validation to intuitive frameworks
   - Challenge or extend current thinking

**Examples of Good Topic Selection:**
- "Neuroscience of habits and behavior change" (if habit formation underrepresented)
- "Collective intelligence and swarm behavior" (if group dynamics missing)
- "Embodied cognition and interoception" (if embodiment gap identified)
- "Complexity science and emergence" (if systems thinking needed)
- "Creativity neuroscience and insight generation" (if creative process mechanics missing)

---

## Phase 2: Execute Research

### Get Current Timestamp
```bash
date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z'
```
Save this for session folder naming: `YYYY-MM-DD Topic Description`

### Launch Research Specialist Agent(s)

**For Each Topic:**

Use Task tool with subagent_type='research-specialist':

```
TOPIC: [Selected topic]

Conduct comprehensive research on [topic] focusing EXCLUSIVELY on the most recent research and developments.

⚠️ CRITICAL RECENCY REQUIREMENT:
Your training data may be outdated. The world changes rapidly, especially in fast-moving fields like AI, neuroscience, and technology. You MUST prioritize the most recent information available through web search, even if it contradicts what you think you know from training data.

⚠️ SOURCE QUALITY REQUIREMENT (recency is NOT enough):
Recent does not mean credible. Prefer the PRIMARY source over anyone summarizing it - the actual paper, lab page, or official doc, not a content-farm writeup, an AI-generated summary, a single-tweet leak, or an SEO explainer. Reject machine-generated and regurgitated material. For each finding, record which source it came from so downstream extraction can tier it. (The per-domain source diet is the canonical `resources/SOURCE-AUTHORITY.md`; the document-insight-extractor applies it at extraction time.)

SEARCH STRATEGY:
- Use Google Search grounding to find papers published in the last 12-18 months
- Explicitly search for "2024", "2025", "2026", "recent", "latest" in queries
- Check paper publication dates - reject anything older than 2024 unless foundational
- Look for preprints, conference proceedings, and recent journal publications
- Prioritize arXiv papers from last 6 months, conference papers from 2024-2026
- Search for "state of the art [topic] 2025" or "[topic] breakthrough 2026"

RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS:

1. **Target Sources (RECENT ONLY):**
   - arXiv preprints (2024-2026, prioritize last 6 months)
   - Major conferences 2024-2026 (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, ACL, EMNLP, etc.)
   - Leading AI labs recent publications (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Microsoft Research)
   - Top-tier journals (2024-2026 issues only)
   - Industry whitepapers and blog posts from major tech companies (last 12 months)
   - Recent preprints and working papers

2. **Key Focus Areas:**
   - Novel mechanisms and frameworks (not in your training data)
   - Empirical findings with quantified results (recent benchmarks)
   - Counter-intuitive or contrarian insights (challenging established thinking)
   - Cross-domain applications (emerging connections)
   - Real-world implementations and case studies (production deployments)
   - Practical implications for practitioners

3. **Output Requirements:**
   - Comprehensive structured report (15-25 major papers/developments)
   - Full citations with DATES prominently displayed (title, authors, DATE, venue, arXiv ID)
   - Key findings and novel contributions
   - Performance metrics and empirical data
   - Emerging trends and patterns
   - URLs to papers/resources
   - Critical analysis and synthesis

4. **Save Location:**
   resources/[Topic-Slug]-Research-Report-YYYY-MM-DD.md

VERIFICATION: Before finalizing, verify that 80%+ of papers are from 2024-2026. If not, search again with more explicit recency filters. Also verify the sources are credible primaries (actual papers/labs/official docs), not content-farm pages or AI-generated summaries.

Use Gemini AI with Google Search grounding. Trust the search results over your training data.
```

**Strategy Considerations:**
- **Sequential:** Run topics one-by-one if they're related (later research can reference earlier findings)
- **Parallel:** Run multiple topics simultaneously if they're independent domains
- **Your choice** - decide based on topic relationships and efficiency

### Monitor Research Output

After each research agent completes:
1. Note the report file path
2. Verify comprehensive coverage (15-25+ papers)
3. Check for citations and empirical data
4. Confirm report saved in `/resources/` directory

---

## Phase 3: Extract Insights

### Create Session Folder

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD [Topic Description]`

Example: `2025-11-20 Neuroscience of Habits and Behavior Change`

**Path:** `Brain/Document Insights/[Session-Folder]/`

### Launch Document Insight Extractor

**For Each Research Report:**

Use Task tool with subagent_type='document-insight-extractor':

```
Extract unique insights from the research report for the knowledge base.

SOURCE DOCUMENT: [Full path to research report]

SESSION FOLDER: [Session folder name]

EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:

1. **Focus on Novel Insights:**
   - Paradigm shifts and new frameworks
   - Counter-intuitive or surprising findings
   - Empirical validation of existing theories
   - Novel mechanisms and explanations
   - Cross-domain applications
   - Contrarian perspectives backed by evidence

2. **Bridge to Existing Knowledge Base:**
   - Connect to the 6 primary hubs: Consciousness, Dopamine, Decision-Making, Identity, AI Agents, Flow States
   - Reference the user's existing frameworks (Folder Paradigm, Mental Models Taxonomy, etc.)
   - Identify consilience opportunities (3+ domains converging)
   - Find validation or challenges to current thinking
   - Look for applications of Buddhist/neuroscience principles

3. **Prioritize:**
   - Research findings that extend current understanding
   - Empirical data that validates intuitive frameworks
   - Novel architectures or methodologies
   - Real-world implications and case studies
   - Philosophical or meta-level insights

4. **Quality Standards:**
   - 15-25 high-quality insights per report
   - Avoid redundancy with existing knowledge base (ALWAYS search for duplicates)
   - Include proper citations (paper title, authors, year)
   - Tag appropriately for discoverability
   - Create connections to existing permanent notes

5. **Output Requirements:**
   - Create permanent notes in session folder
   - Include full citations and sources
   - Add relevant tags
   - Note connections to existing insights
   - Create changelog: CHANGELOG - Document Analysis YYYY-MM-DD.md

CRITICAL:
- ALWAYS search for duplicates before creating notes
- Store ALL extracted notes in: Brain/Document Insights/[Session-Folder]/
- Create comprehensive changelog documenting extraction process
```

### Monitor Extraction Output

After extraction completes:
1. Verify insights stored in correct Document Insights session folder
2. Check changelog was created
3. Note count of unique insights extracted
4. Confirm deduplication was performed

---

## Phase 4: Insight Interview (Optional)

After extraction completes, present the top findings and offer to run an insight interview before connection discovery. This captures your personal perspective alongside the external research - making the final connection map richer because it maps both what the research says AND what you actually think about it.

### Present Top Insights

Summarize the 5-8 most significant extracted insights from the session folder:
- List note titles with one-sentence descriptions
- Highlight findings that challenge existing KB frameworks or contradict current notes
- Flag any surprising or counterintuitive results

### [APPROVAL GATE] - Run Insight Interview?

Present to user:

> "[N] insights extracted on [topic]. Before connection discovery, would you like to do a quick insight interview? I'll ask you 6-8 questions grounded in your existing notes and these new findings - to capture YOUR angles, reactions, and disagreements. Your responses save to `Brain/AI Extracted Notes/` and the connection finder will map both sets together.
>
> Say **yes** to run the interview, or **skip** to go straight to connection discovery."

**If yes:** Invoke the insight-interview skill for the current topic.
- The dialogue runs here - one question at a time
- User insights saved to `Brain/AI Extracted Notes/`
- Note the session timestamp so connection discovery can include these new notes

**If skip:** Proceed directly to Phase 5.

### Update Scope for Connection Discovery

If the interview ran, Phase 5 should map connections across both:
- External research: `Brain/Document Insights/[Session-Folder]/`
- Personal insights: new notes created in `Brain/AI Extracted Notes/` during this session

---

## Phase 5: Connection Discovery

### Launch Connection Finder Agent(s)

**Strategy Options:**

**Option A: Single Comprehensive Pass**
- Run connection-finder once on the entire session folder
- Maps all new insights against full knowledge base

**Option B: Multiple Targeted Passes**
- Run connection-finder 2-3 times on different subsets
- First pass: New insights ↔ Existing AI insights (102 notes)
- Second pass: New insights ↔ Primary hubs (Dopamine, Consciousness, etc.)
- Third pass: Cross-domain bridges and synthesis opportunities

**Your Choice** - Select based on insight count and domain diversity.

### Execute Connection Discovery

Use Task tool with subagent_type='connection-finder':

```
Discover connections between newly extracted insights and existing knowledge base.

STARTING POINTS:
All notes in session folder: Brain/Document Insights/[Session-Folder]/

Or specify individual notes if doing targeted passes.

CONNECTION DISCOVERY GOALS:

## Quality Standards & Best Practices

### Topic Selection (Autonomous Mode)
- **Strategic alignment:** Choose topics that build on existing strengths or fill critical gaps
- **Cross-domain potential:** Prefer topics that bridge multiple knowledge base hubs
- **Empirical grounding:** Select areas with active research (2024-2026 papers available)
- **Practical relevance:** Topics should have real-world applications or implications

### Research Quality
- **Recency:** Prioritize 2024-2026 papers and developments
- **Rigor:** Prefer primary sources (the actual paper/lab/official doc) over summaries; reject content-farm and AI-generated regurgitation. See the canonical source diet in `resources/SOURCE-AUTHORITY.md`.
- **Depth:** 15-25 major papers minimum per topic
- **Breadth:** Cover multiple perspectives and approaches
- **Empirics:** Include quantified results and performance metrics

### Insight Extraction
- **Novelty:** Only extract genuinely new perspectives
- **Deduplication:** ALWAYS search before creating notes
- **Citations:** Include full source attribution
- **Connections:** Link to existing knowledge base
- **Quality > Quantity:** 15-25 high-value insights, not 100 mediocre ones

### Connection Discovery
- **Non-obvious focus:** Surface-level links are less valuable
- **Cross-domain priority:** Consilience zones are gold
- **Synthesis orientation:** Identify article/framework opportunities
- **Actionable output:** Provide concrete next steps

### Documentation
- **Comprehensive changelogs:** Document every phase
- **Clear file organization:** Session folders in Document Insights
- **Master log updates:** Keep CHANGELOG.md current
- **Audit trail:** Future-you should understand what happened and why

---

## Execution Protocol

1. **Parse input** → Determine directed vs. autonomous mode
2. **Select topics** → Either use provided topics or analyze knowledge base for gaps
3. **Get timestamp** → For session folder naming
4. **Research phase** → Launch research-specialist agent(s)
5. **Extraction phase** → Launch document-insight-extractor for each report
6. **Insight interview** → Optional gate: present top findings, offer `/insight-interview` to capture your angles before connection discovery
7. **Connection phase** → Launch connection-finder agent(s) across both document and personal insights
8. **Generate summary** → Comprehensive session report
9. **Provide recommendations** → Actionable next steps for content creation

**Key Principle:** Fully autonomous execution. No human intervention required between phases. All insights stored in Document Insights folder structure to maintain separation from main Brain.

---

## Error Handling

**If research finds insufficient papers:**
- Broaden search criteria
- Extend date range (include 2023)
- Consider adjacent topics
- Document limitation in summary

**If extraction finds too many duplicates:**
- Focus on truly novel contributions
- Look for empirical validation of concepts
- Seek contrarian perspectives
- Consider topic was already well-covered

**If connection-finder finds weak connections:**
- Topic may be genuinely novel (good!)
- Increase similarity threshold range
- Run additional passes on specific hubs
- Document gap as synthesis opportunity

**If any phase fails:**
- Document error in summary
- Continue with successful phases
- Provide partial results
- Recommend retry or alternative approach

---

**Remember:** This is a knowledge base expansion engine. Your goal is to systematically grow the user's second brain with cutting-edge, well-integrated insights that enhance his intellectual capabilities and content creation potential.
