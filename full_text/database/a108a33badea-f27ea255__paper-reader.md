# Paper Reader v2

## Mission

Given a validated `paper_manifest.json`, achieve deep comprehension of each
paper — not flat claims rendering — and persist structured knowledge artifacts
in the Citadel vault.

V2 replaces the v1 one-pass extraction model with a 15-step pipeline that
translates, segments, and reads each paper section by section using subagents
guided by the Reading Constitution. The final output is a synthesis of
per-section comprehension notes, not a mechanical rendering from a claims JSON.

Paper-reader owns:
- source acquisition and format-based fallback selection
- paper-bank storage and manifest updates
- translation to structured markdown
- segmentation with relevance hints
- catalog construction and maintenance
- comprehension via subagents (positioning, technical, empirical)
- vault integration and knowledge-maester coordination
- summary synthesis and polishing
- Zotero item create/update and cite-key synchronization
- `refs.bib` generation and Level 1 citation validation
- self-improvement signal generation from feedback

Paper-reader does not own discovery ranking, synthesis across papers, or
survey drafting.

## Read First

- [references/extraction-templates.md](references/extraction-templates.md)
- [references/citation-validation.md](references/citation-validation.md)
- [reading-constitution.md](reading-constitution.md) — Layer A reading strategies
  loaded by every comprehension subagent

## Inputs

- `<WORK_ROOT>/manifests/paper_manifest.json` from discovery
- `VAULT_ROOT`: configurable (e.g. `~/Documents/citadel/`)
  _Scripts append `literature/papers/<cite_key>/` internally; pass the vault root, not the `literature/` subdirectory._
- `WORK_ROOT`: configurable (e.g. `~/.research-workdir/`)
- `PAPER_BANK`: configurable (e.g. `~/Documents/paper-bank/`)
- Optional batch controls such as `max_extract` and `max_download`

## Required Outputs

**In Citadel (knowledge artifacts):**
- `<VAULT_ROOT>/papers/<cite_key>.md` — final summary note
- `<VAULT_ROOT>/papers/<cite_key>/intro.md`, `notation.md`, `model.md`,
  `method.md`, `theory.md`, `proofs.md`, `empirical.md`, `gaps.md` — per-section
  comprehension notes (status: draft during pipeline; reviewed after polish)
- `<VAULT_ROOT>/<cite_key>-catalog.md` — paper catalog
- `<VAULT_ROOT>/claims/<cite_key>.json` — v2 claims JSON
- `<VAULT_ROOT>/refs.bib`
- `<VAULT_ROOT>/_papers-needing-download.md` when papers cannot be acquired

**In paper-bank (files and structured data):**
- `<PAPER_BANK>/<cite_key>/raw/` — source files (PDF, LaTeX archive)
- `<PAPER_BANK>/<cite_key>/translated_full.md`
- `<PAPER_BANK>/<cite_key>/_translation_manifest.json`
- `<PAPER_BANK>/<cite_key>/segments/_index.json` and `seg-*.md`
- `<PAPER_BANK>/<cite_key>/notation_dict.yaml`
- `<PAPER_BANK>/<cite_key>/author_keywords.txt` — author-provided keywords extracted during translation
- `<PAPER_BANK>/<cite_key>/_vault-write-requests.json`
- `<PAPER_BANK>/_manifest.json`
- `<WORK_ROOT>/preflight_report.json`

## Preflight

Run preflight before acquisition:

```bash
python3 skills/paper-reader/scripts/preflight_extraction.py \
  --output "<WORK_ROOT>/preflight_report.json"
```

Preflight checks (v2):
- All v1 tool checks (pdftotext, pdfinfo, python3, jq)
- `translation_ready`: MinerU availability for PDF-path translation
- `vault_connected`: Citadel vault directory exists and is writable
- `paper_bank_ready`: paper-bank root exists

If preflight reports `overall != "ready"`, stop and report the missing required
tool or directory.

## Direct Source Entry Point (No Manifest)

When running a single-paper extraction without `paper_manifest.json`, use the
pipeline orchestrator directly with `--cite-key` and `--source-path`.

```bash
python3 skills/paper-reader/scripts/run_pipeline.py \
  --cite-key "<cite_key>" \
  --source-format "<pdf|latex|html|markdown>" \
  --source-path "<path to source directory or file>" \
  --paper-bank-dir "<PAPER_BANK>/<cite_key>" \
  --vault-root "<VAULT_ROOT>" \
  --run-report-path "<WORK_ROOT>/logs/<cite_key>-run-report.json"
```

Notes:
- Use `--source-format pdf` for direct PDF ingestion; the orchestrator will run
  PDF segmentation before translation.
- `--source-path` can point to a source directory or a single file. For PDF
  files, the parent directory is used for segmentation input.

## Modes

Select a mode before starting the pipeline. The default is `paper`.

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `paper` | Default. Processes a single academic paper through the full 15-step pipeline. See [references/modes/paper.md](references/modes/paper.md). |
| `book` | Processes a book or long-form document with chapter-level segmentation. See [references/modes/book.md](references/modes/book.md). |
| `chain_map` | Builds a citation chain map across multiple related papers. See [references/modes/chain_map.md](references/modes/chain_map.md). |
| `simple` | Short non-academic content (regulatory bulletins, rating actions, sell-side notes, primers). Single-subagent pipeline with a fixed 6-section schema. See [references/modes/simple.md](references/modes/simple.md). |
| `10k` | Primary SEC Form 10-K filings. Item-boundary segmentation, 3-subagent comprehension, 14-section summary, per-Item notes, claims sidecar. See [references/modes/10k.md](references/modes/10k.md). |

### Book mode walkthrough

Use `book` mode for long-form institutional documents (monographs, annual
reports, multi-chapter research volumes) that require chapter-level
segmentation and cross-chapter synthesis.

#### One-command invocation

```bash
python3 scripts/run_pipeline.py \
  --mode book \
  --chapter-plan plans/iea_weo_2025.md \
  --source downloads/iea_weo_2025.pdf \
  --cite-key iea_weo_2025 \
  --vault-root "<VAULT_ROOT>" \
  --paper-bank-dir "<PAPER_BANK>/iea_weo_2025"
```

#### What to prepare: the chapter plan

Create a chapter plan Markdown file before running. The plan has two parts:

**YAML frontmatter** — declares `cite_key`, `source_pdf`, and `claim_domain`
(use `institutional` for book mode), plus optional `page_offset` and
`synthesis_target_words`:

```yaml
---
cite_key: iea_weo_2025
source_pdf: downloads/iea_weo_2025.pdf
claim_domain: institutional
page_offset: 0
synthesis_target_words: 5000
---
```

**Chapter table** — one row per chapter with six required columns:

| Column | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `slug` | Unique short identifier; names the output file |
| `page_range` | Inclusive physical page range, e.g. `19-55` |
| `depth` | `deep` (full extraction), `summary` (headlines only), or `skip` |
| `include_in_synthesis` | `true` to merge into the synthesis; `false` to exclude |
| `domain_lens` | Thematic label; must be consistent across all `include_in_synthesis: true` rows |
| `role` | Human-readable chapter role (e.g. `scenario_chapter`) |

See [references/chapter-plan-schema.md](references/chapter-plan-schema.md) for the full
schema, validation rules, and a worked example.

#### What the pipeline produces

For a plan with N non-skipped chapters:

- **N chapter notes** — `extractions/<cite_key>/chapters/<slug>.json`
- **One synthesis note** — `extractions/<cite_key>/synthesis.md` with
  `## Overview`, `## Key Findings`, `## Policy Recommendations`,
  `## Projections`, and `## Gaps`
- **Vault summary note** — `<VAULT_ROOT>/papers/<cite_key>.md`
- **Claims sidecar** — `<VAULT_ROOT>/claims/<cite_key>.json` (merged from
  all `include_in_synthesis: true` chapters)

Chapters with `depth: skip` produce no output and appear only in `## Gaps`.

#### Concurrency and retry

The dispatcher runs at most **5** chapter subagents concurrently; additional
chapters queue and launch as slots free. A failing chapter is retried once. On
a second failure the chapter is marked `failed` in the run manifest and
recorded in synthesis `## Gaps`; the pipeline continues with remaining chapters.

#### Claim types

Book mode enforces `claim_domain: institutional`. Permitted types: `theorem`,
`assumption`, `methodology`, `empirical`, `connection`, `limitation`,
`policy-recommendation`, `projection`, `data-availability`, `code-availability`.
The types `company-thesis` and `supply-chain-fact` are rejected by the validator.

Per-chapter sidecars use `<cite_key>__<slug>` as the claim namespace. Cross-chapter
`connection` claims reference other chapters via `<cite_key>__<slug>:claim:<index>`.
See [references/modes/book.md](references/modes/book.md) for the full claim-type
table and cross-chapter connection format.

### chain_map mode walkthrough

Use `chain_map` mode for sell-side equity research documents — initiation notes,
sector surveys, supply-chain thematic reports — that list multiple companies with
tickers in numbered exhibit tables. The pipeline extracts a structured company
inventory from every exhibit, normalises tickers to exchange-qualified form, and
writes a single Markdown report with an embedded fenced CSV.

#### One-command invocation

```bash
python3 scripts/run_pipeline.py \
  --mode chain_map \
  --source downloads/humanoid_100.pdf \
  --cite-key cicc_humanoid_2024 \
  --watchlist watchlists/my_portfolio.md
```

`--watchlist` is optional (see below). `--cite-key` defaults to a slugified
form of the PDF filename when omitted.

#### What to prepare

**Source PDF (required).** A born-digital PDF with a text layer. Before
extraction, the pipeline runs `scripts/pdf_probe.py` to confirm a text layer
is present. If the probe returns `text_layer: false` the run aborts with
`IMAGE_ONLY_PDF` and a recommendation to OCR the file first.

**Watchlist (optional).** A Markdown file whose body contains a GFM pipe table
with at least two columns: `ticker` (exchange-qualified, e.g. `002050.SZ`) and
`name`. Additional columns (`tier`, `track`, `notes`) are passed through
unchanged. Minimal example:

```markdown
| ticker    | name                        |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| 002050.SZ | Sanhua Intelligent Controls |
| NVDA      | NVIDIA Corporation          |
```

When supplied, every company found in both the PDF and the watchlist receives
`in_watchlist: true` in the inventory. Companies on the watchlist that do not
appear in any exhibit are listed in a `## Watchlist Gaps` output section.

#### What the pipeline produces

The run writes a single report file:

```
extractions/<cite_key>/chain_map.md
```

The report contains eight top-level sections in fixed order:
`## Overview`, `## Company Inventory`, `## Supply-Chain Map`,
`## Investment Theses`, `## Watchlist Overlap`, `## Unknown Tickers`,
`## Extraction Notes`, and `## data_sections`.

The `## Company Inventory` section embeds a fenced CSV block inside a
collapsible `<details>` element. The CSV has nine required columns:
`ticker_normalised`, `ticker_raw`, `exchange`, `company_name`, `exhibit_num`,
`tier`, `target_price`, `supply_chain_role`, `in_watchlist`. Publisher-specific
extension columns (prefixed `x_<publisher>_`) may follow.

The `## data_sections` section is a fenced YAML block that acts as the
machine-readable contract for downstream skills. It records counts
(`company_count`, `normalised_count`, `unknown_ticker_count`, `exhibit_count`)
and paths (`inventory_path`, `claims_path`) so that downstream consumers can
navigate the report without relying on section position.

A claims sidecar is also written at `claims/<cite_key>-claims.json` (see
§ Claim types below).

#### Ticker normalization and edge cases

`scripts/ticker_normalizer.py` converts raw ticker strings to
exchange-qualified form using a priority chain:

1. **Known suffix present** — e.g. `002050.SZ` accepted as-is after suffix
   validation.
2. **Country shorthand** — e.g. `0700-HK` → `0700.HK`; `6954-JP` → `6954.T`.
3. **Bare numeric** — 6-digit starting with `0`/`3` → `.SZ`; `6` → `.SS`; 4–5
   digit → `.HK` (candidate) or `.T`.
4. **Unresolvable** — `ticker_normalised` set to `null`, `exchange` to
   `unknown`; company retained in inventory and listed in `## Unknown Tickers`.

Notable edge cases:
- **Empty exhibits** — exhibit header detected but no rows pass the filter.
  Counted in `data_sections.empty_exhibit_count`; listed in
  `## Extraction Notes`. No rows emitted; pipeline continues.
- **Image-only pages** — a single page in an otherwise born-digital PDF with
  fewer than 20 extracted characters. Logged as `image-only page`; non-fatal
  (exit code 0).
- **Duplicate companies** — same `ticker_normalised` appears in multiple
  exhibits. Merged into one inventory row; `exhibit_num` becomes a
  comma-separated list (e.g. `3,7`); `tier` and `target_price` taken from the
  first exhibit.
- **Unknown tickers** — confidence is degraded one level (`high` → `medium`,
  `medium` → `low`). A `normalization_warning` field is added to the
  corresponding `company-thesis` claim; the pipeline does not abort.

#### Claim types

`chain_map` mode sets `claim_domain: sell_side`. The primary claim type is
`company-thesis` — one entry per company with a non-null `tier` and a
`supply_chain_role`. Additional permitted types: `projection`,
`supply-chain-fact`, `methodology`, `empirical`, `connection`, `limitation`,
`data-availability`. The types `theorem`, `assumption`,
`policy-recommendation`, and `code-availability` are rejected by
`validate_extraction.py`.

See [references/modes/chain_map.md](references/modes/chain_map.md) and
[references/chain-map-schema.md](references/chain-map-schema.md) for the full
field definitions, data_sections contract, and backwards-compatibility rules.

### simple mode walkthrough

Use `simple` mode for short non-academic content (~2–15 KB) that benefits
from uniform structured extraction but does not warrant the full academic
pipeline: regulatory investor-education bulletins, credit rating-action
press releases, sell-side analyst snippets, industry-press deep-dives,
practitioner methodology primers.

Simple mode runs a minimal three-step pipeline — translate (passthrough or
PyMuPDF / pandoc) → single-subagent comprehension → validator. No
segmentation, catalog, claims sidecar, Zotero, or refs.bib.

#### Invocation

```bash
python3 scripts/run_pipeline.py \
  --mode simple \
  --cite-key sec-bulletin-10k-reading \
  --source-format markdown \
  --source-path downloads/sec-bulletin.md \
  --source-type regulatory-bulletin \
  --paper-bank-dir "<PAPER_BANK>/sec-bulletin-10k-reading" \
  --vault-root "<VAULT_ROOT>"
```

`--source-type` is required and drives the comprehension prompt's emphasis.
Allowed values: `primer`, `rating-action`, `sell-side-note`,
`earnings-commentary`, `industry-press`, `regulatory-bulletin`,
`short-academic-note`, `other`.

#### Output

One file at `<vault>/papers/<cite_key>.md` with YAML frontmatter and six
fixed sections (Overview, Key Claims, Methodology Guidance, Verbatim
Quotes, Cross-References, Gaps and Limitations). See
[references/modes/simple.md](references/modes/simple.md).

### 10k mode walkthrough

Use `10k` mode for primary SEC Form 10-K filings. Input is typically a
born-digital PDF downloaded from EDGAR; HTML / inline-XBRL is also
supported via `translate_10k_html.py`.

10-K mode uses Item-boundary segmentation (not token-count), dispatches
three parallel comprehension subagents (positioning, financial-lens,
risk-controls-forward), and produces a 14-section summary plus per-Item
notes and a claims sidecar.

#### Invocation

```bash
python3 scripts/run_pipeline.py \
  --mode 10k \
  --cite-key NVDA_10k_FY2024 \
  --ticker NVDA \
  --source-format pdf \
  --source-path downloads/NVDA-10K-FY2024.pdf \
  --filing-metadata metadata/NVDA_10k_FY2024.json \
  --paper-bank-dir "<PAPER_BANK>/NVDA_10k_FY2024" \
  --vault-root "<VAULT_ROOT>"
```

`--ticker` is required so downstream consumers (e.g.,
knowledge-maester's `ingest_ticker.py --mode append-thesis`) can key
vault writes. `--filing-metadata` is optional; when supplied, its fields
are written through to the summary frontmatter verbatim.

#### Output

- Summary note: `<vault>/papers/<cite_key>.md` (14 fixed sections).
- Per-Item notes: `<vault>/papers/<cite_key>/item-<N>.md` (one per
  canonical Item; absent / incorporated-by-reference Items get stubs).
- Claims sidecar: `<vault>/claims/<cite_key>.json` (permitted types:
  `methodology`, `empirical`, `projection`, `limitation`,
  `data-availability`, `company-thesis`, `supply-chain-fact`).
- iXBRL numeric facts (HTML sources only): `<paper-bank>/_xbrl_tags.json`.

See [references/modes/10k.md](references/modes/10k.md) for the full
specification and MVP limitations.

## Workflow

This skill executes a pipeline beginning with a reading plan stage (Step 0)
followed by 15 execution steps. Each step has defined input artifacts and
output artifacts. Steps run in order; re-segmentation (Step 9) is automatic
when triggered by the comprehension orchestrator.

### Step 0 — Draft and write reading plan

Before executing any pipeline steps, draft a structured reading plan and write
it to disk. The plan is written to `paper-bank/<cite_key>/_reading_plan.md`
**before** any comprehension phase begins, so it survives session interruptions.

**Inputs:** cite_key, source path, estimated page/section count.

**Resolve vault output paths before drafting.** Before writing any subagent
prompt, call `comprehend_paper.py --dry-run` (or replicate `resolve_papers_dir`
/ `resolve_claims_dir` logic inline) to determine the correct absolute paths:

```
vault_papers_dir  = VAULT_ROOT/literature/papers/  (if it exists, else VAULT_ROOT/papers/)
vault_claims_dir  = VAULT_ROOT/literature/claims/  (if it exists, else VAULT_ROOT/claims/)
```

Embed these resolved paths — not `VAULT_ROOT` plus a hardcoded suffix — into
every subagent prompt's output paths. This prevents subagents from writing
artifacts to a flat `VAULT_ROOT/papers/` when the vault uses a `literature/`
hierarchy.

**Path Verification Block — run `comprehend_paper.py --dry-run` to confirm resolved paths before writing any subagent prompt:**

```bash
python3 skills/paper-reader/scripts/comprehend_paper.py \
  --dry-run \
  --vault-root "<VAULT_ROOT>" \
  --cite-key "<cite_key>"
```

Capture `vault_papers_dir` and `vault_claims_dir` from stdout. If `--dry-run`
is unavailable, replicate the inline logic shown above. Confirm both values
are absolute paths before continuing. **Every subagent prompt in the reading
plan must use these constants — never `VAULT_ROOT + "/papers/"` or
`VAULT_ROOT + "/claims/"` as literal strings.**

**Process:**

1. **Draft the plan** using the canonical template defined in
   `testrun6/vossler-combined-issues.md` under F-002.

   The reading plan file must begin with a **Resolved Paths** header block that
   locks in the absolute vault paths resolved above:

       ## Resolved Vault Paths (do not change)
       - vault_papers_dir: <absolute resolved path>
       - vault_claims_dir: <absolute resolved path>
       - vault_catalog_dir: <VAULT_ROOT>/literature/ (or VAULT_ROOT/ if no literature/)

   Every subagent prompt block in the plan must copy `vault_papers_dir` and
   `vault_claims_dir` from this header verbatim — never re-derive paths inline.

   The plan must contain one entry per phase:
   - Phase 1: Translation & Segmentation — main agent
   - Phase 2: Introduction Comprehension — subagent
   - Phase 3: Technical Comprehension — subagent
   - Phase 4: Empirical & Gaps Comprehension — subagent
   - Phase 5: Vault Note Synthesis — main agent (or subagent for long papers)

   Each comprehension phase entry must include an embedded subagent prompt so
   nothing is lost if the session is interrupted mid-run.

   At the end of the plan, include the following Post-Processing section:

   ## Phase 6: Post-Processing
   - PP1: Collect dummy-note-backed references — read `<WORK_ROOT>/logs/<cite_key>-run-report.json` for `dummy_notes_written` entries; only papers with dummy notes enter the reference queue
   - PP2: Write reference queue patch file to `$PAPER_BANK/rq-patches/<cite_key>-rq-patch.md` as a markdown table (columns: arxiv_id, cite_key, title, importance_score, sessions_cited, first_seen, status); each new row gets importance_score:1, sessions_cited:1, first_seen:<today>, status:mentioned
   - PP3: Update `$PAPER_BANK/acquisition-list.md` status from `downloaded` → `read`; append `<ISO timestamp> | read | <cite_key> | <arxiv_id> | pipeline complete` to `$PAPER_BANK/acquisition-log.md`; if cite_key not found log warning but do not fail
   - PP4: Move `$PAPER_BANK/prompts/<cite_key>-prompt.md` to `$PAPER_BANK/prompts/done/<cite_key>-prompt.md` if it exists
   - Run experience-logger for this session

2. **Proofread the drafted plan** — check for missing sections, coverage gaps,
   and inconsistencies. Verify that every phase has an assigned agent, a
   "Write after:" artifact list, and an embedded prompt. Revise any gaps before
   proceeding.

3. **Write** the finalized plan to `paper-bank/<cite_key>/_reading_plan.md`.

4. **Default (automatic) mode** — proceed immediately after writing the plan.
   No pause required. The plan is available for retroactive inspection.

5. **Approval mode (explicit opt-in)** — activated only when the user
   explicitly requests review before execution (e.g., "show me the plan first"
   or "read this paper and show me the plan first"). In this mode, pause and
   wait for user sign-off. The user may edit the plan before approving.

**Output:** `paper-bank/<cite_key>/_reading_plan.md`

> **Execution discipline (applies to all subsequent phases):** Write every
> artifact to disk immediately upon completion — section notes, theorem index
> entries, claim sidecars. Do not accumulate content in context. Comprehension
> phases (Steps 6–8) are dispatched as subagents per the reading plan.

### Step 1 — Load manifest and preserve identity rules

- Read schema-v1 `paper_manifest.json` from discovery.
- Treat manifest-level `cite_key` as provisional until note creation.
- If stronger identifiers are discovered before note creation, promote
  `canonical_id` and re-derive `cite_key` before materializing the note.
- Once `papers/<cite_key>.md` exists, `canonical_id` and `cite_key` are frozen
  unless Zotero sync explicitly returns a new citation key.

**Output:** resolved `cite_key`, `canonical_id`, source format detected.

### Step 2 — Acquire sources

Prefer formats in this order:
1. arXiv LaTeX source (`https://arxiv.org/e-print/<arxiv_id>`)
2. arXiv PDF fallback
3. Other PDF URL from the manifest
4. Manual download queue

All acquired files are saved to `paper-bank/<cite_key>/raw/`. V2 attempts all
available formats (PDF, LaTeX source archive, HTML) so that the translator can
select the best format.

```bash
bash skills/paper-reader/scripts/download_arxiv_sources.sh \
  "<WORK_ROOT>/manifests/paper_manifest.json" \
  "<WORK_ROOT>/downloads/arxiv" \
  "<WORK_ROOT>/downloads/arxiv-extracted"

bash skills/paper-reader/scripts/download_pdfs.sh \
  "<WORK_ROOT>/manifests/paper_manifest.json" \
  "<WORK_ROOT>/downloads/pdfs"

python3 skills/paper-reader/scripts/manage_paper_bank.py \
  --cite-key "<cite_key>" \
  --canonical-id "<canonical_id>" \
  --title "<paper title>" \
  --pdf "<WORK_ROOT>/downloads/pdfs/<cite_key>.pdf" \
  --source "<WORK_ROOT>/downloads/arxiv-extracted/<arxiv_id>" \
  --metadata-json "<WORK_ROOT>/tmp/<cite_key>-metadata.json" \
  --output "<WORK_ROOT>/logs/<cite_key>-paper-bank.json"
```

**Output:** `paper-bank/<cite_key>/raw/`; `_manifest.json` updated.

### Step 3 — Translate paper to structured markdown

Convert the best available source to a unified markdown representation.

**Translator dispatch.** Before translation begins, `translate_paper.py` runs a
lightweight probe (`pdf_probe.py`) that inspects PDF producer/creator metadata
and samples the embedded text layer to classify the document:

- **Born-digital PDFs** — producer metadata and a dense text layer indicate a
  natively digital document. These route to **PyMuPDF**, which extracts text
  directly from the PDF object model (typically under 2 seconds). PyMuPDF is
  chosen when the probe's `is_born_digital` score exceeds the confidence
  threshold.
- **Scan-like PDFs** — sparse or absent text layer, or producer metadata
  consistent with a scanner or image-based workflow. These route to **MinerU**,
  which applies layout analysis and OCR for a higher-fidelity extraction
  (current default behavior for scanned papers).

**CLI overrides.** Automatic dispatch can be overridden per invocation:
- `--force-pymupdf` — always use PyMuPDF regardless of probe result.
- `--force-mineru` — always use MinerU regardless of probe result.

**PyMuPDF trade-offs.** When PyMuPDF is selected (automatically or via
`--force-pymupdf`), the following limitations apply and are recorded in the
translation manifest:
- Figures and embedded images are **not** extracted; figure captions are
  retained as text only.
- Complex multi-column table layouts may be merged into a single column or
  produce garbled row order.

Use `--force-mineru` for papers where table fidelity or figure extraction is
critical.

**Translation manifest fields.** After translation, `_translation_manifest.json`
is written with the following fields (among others):
- `translator_used` — `"pymupdf"` or `"mineru"`.
- `reason` — human-readable explanation of why the translator was chosen
  (e.g., `"born-digital: probe confidence 0.94"` or `"forced via CLI flag"`).
- `probe_metadata` — raw output from `pdf_probe.py`: producer string, creator
  string, sampled text density, and `is_born_digital` score.
- `trade_offs_disclosed` — list of trade-off strings recorded when PyMuPDF is
  used (empty list for MinerU paths).

After translation, scan the translated text for "Keywords:" or "Key words:"
sections and extract author-provided keywords to
`<PAPER_BANK>/<cite_key>/author_keywords.txt`.

```bash
python3 skills/paper-reader/scripts/translate_paper.py \
  --cite-key "<cite_key>" \
  --bank-dir "<PAPER_BANK>/<cite_key>" \
  --output "<PAPER_BANK>/<cite_key>/translated_full.md"
```

**Output:** `translated_full.md`, `_translation_manifest.json` (includes
`translator_used`, `reason`, `probe_metadata`, `trade_offs_disclosed`),
`_translation_warnings.log`, `_theorem_index.json`, `author_keywords.txt`
(when keywords are found in the source).

### Step 4 — Segment paper

Split the translated markdown into indexed chunks with section labels and
relevance hints.

```bash
python3 skills/paper-reader/scripts/segment_paper.py \
  --cite-key "<cite_key>" \
  --input "<PAPER_BANK>/<cite_key>/translated_full.md" \
  --output-dir "<PAPER_BANK>/<cite_key>/segments/"
```

**Output:** `segments/_index.json` and `segments/seg-*.md`. Each segment file
has YAML frontmatter with `cite_key`, `segment_id`, `section_label`,
`token_estimate`, `source_pages`, `comprehension_status: pending`.

### Step 5 — Build initial catalog

Initialize the paper catalog in Citadel with metadata, source format, and
segment inventory.

```bash
python3 skills/paper-reader/scripts/build_catalog.py \
  --cite-key "<cite_key>" \
  --metadata-json "<WORK_ROOT>/tmp/<cite_key>-metadata.json" \
  --segment-index "<PAPER_BANK>/<cite_key>/segments/_index.json" \
  --vault-root "<VAULT_ROOT>" \
  --claim-domain "<academic|book|industry>" \
  --output "<VAULT_ROOT>/<cite_key>-catalog.md"
```

`--claim-domain` controls which claim-type subset the catalog records as expected for this document. Default: `academic`.

**Output:** `citadel/literature/<cite_key>-catalog.md` (status: draft).

### Step 6 — Comprehension: Positioning and Literature

Spawn the positioning subagent. The subagent reads the abstract, introduction,
and notation segments, guided by SKILL.md + `reading-constitution.md` + relevant
domain meta-notes (Layer B, up to 3 per section type).

The subagent writes comprehension notes directly to Citadel with `status: draft`.
The intro subagent explicitly notes the paper's self-identified keywords and
contribution areas: it lists author-provided keywords verbatim under an
`## Author Keywords` heading in `intro.md`.

**Output:**
- `citadel/papers/<cite_key>/intro.md` (includes `## Author Keywords` section)
- `citadel/papers/<cite_key>/notation.md`
- Dummy reference stubs in Citadel with `status: stub`

### Step 7 — Comprehension: Technical (model, method, theory)

Spawn the technical subagent. Reads model, method, theory, and proof segments.
Extracts formal equations, parameter spaces, estimation procedures, algorithm
descriptions, convergence rates, and proof strategies.

The model and method subagents identify key methods used in the paper. Each
lists the primary statistical or computational methods under a `## Key Methods`
heading in `model.md` and `method.md` respectively.

**Output:**
- `citadel/papers/<cite_key>/model.md` (includes `## Key Methods` section)
- `citadel/papers/<cite_key>/method.md` (includes `## Key Methods` section)
- `citadel/papers/<cite_key>/theory.md`
- `citadel/papers/<cite_key>/proofs.md`
- `paper-bank/<cite_key>/notation_dict.yaml` (extended with new symbols)

### Step 8 — Comprehension: Empirical and Gaps

Spawn the empirical subagent. Reads simulation, real-data, and
discussion/conclusion segments. Applies ADEMP framework for simulation reviews.
Cross-checks claimed contributions from `intro.md` against evidence found in
empirical sections.

**Output:**
- `citadel/papers/<cite_key>/empirical.md`
- `citadel/papers/<cite_key>/gaps.md`
- Catalog updated with `comprehension_complete` status on empirical sections

### Step 9 — Re-segmentation (automatic when triggered)

The comprehension orchestrator monitors for segment boundary issues (split,
merge, or rebalance triggers). When detected, re-segmentation runs automatically.

```bash
python3 skills/paper-reader/scripts/resegment_paper.py \
  --cite-key "<cite_key>" \
  --catalog "<VAULT_ROOT>/<cite_key>-catalog.md" \
  --segment-dir "<PAPER_BANK>/<cite_key>/segments/"
```

**Output:** Updated segment index and catalog in paper-bank. Audit log written
even when no changes are made (no-op path must complete without error).

### Step 10 — Vault integration

Emit write requests for cross-paper vault operations. Do not write wikilinks,
concept notes, assumption notes, or meta-note updates directly — route them
through knowledge-maester.

```bash
python3 skills/paper-reader/scripts/integrate_vault.py \
  --cite-key "<cite_key>" \
  --vault-root "<VAULT_ROOT>" \
  --output "<PAPER_BANK>/<cite_key>/_vault-write-requests.json"
```

Then invoke knowledge-maester with the request file to apply writes.

**Output:** `paper-bank/<cite_key>/_vault-write-requests.json`; knowledge-maester
applies: cross-paper wikilinks, concept notes, assumption notes, meta-note updates,
dummy stub upgrades — all in Citadel.

### Step 11 — Summary and Polish

Synthesize per-section draft notes into a final literature note. Polish each
per-section note in place (status: draft → reviewed). Run quiz and faithfulness
checks.

The summary note frontmatter includes three additive fields (when data is
available):
- `author_keywords`: list sourced from `author_keywords.txt` or `intro.md`
- `summary`: one-to-two sentence TL;DR synthesized from section notes
- `methods`: list of key methods collected from `model.md`/`method.md`

```bash
python3 skills/paper-reader/scripts/summarize_paper.py \
  --cite-key "<cite_key>" \
  --vault-root "<VAULT_ROOT>" \
  --output "<VAULT_ROOT>/papers/<cite_key>.md"
```

The v2 claims JSON supports 12 claim types. The 8 academic types apply to all documents:
`theorem`, `assumption`, `methodology`, `empirical`, `connection`, `limitation`,
`data-availability`, `code-availability`. Four extended types apply to non-academic
domains (industry reports, energy-transition documents, equity research):
`policy-recommendation`, `projection`, `supply-chain-fact`, `company-thesis`.
See [references/extraction-templates.md § Extended Claim Types and the Disambiguation note](references/extraction-templates.md)
for field requirements and examples.

**Output:**
- `citadel/papers/<cite_key>.md` — final polished summary note (with `author_keywords`, `summary`, `methods` in frontmatter)
- `citadel/papers/<cite_key>/` — per-section notes polished in place
- `citadel/literature/claims/<cite_key>.json` — v2 claims format
- `citadel/literature/<cite_key>-catalog.md` — finalized

### Step 12 — Zotero sync

```bash
python3 skills/paper-reader/scripts/sync_zotero.py \
  "<VAULT_ROOT>/papers/<cite_key>.md" \
  --output "<WORK_ROOT>/logs/<cite_key>-zotero-sync.json"
```

- Metadata updated from note frontmatter.
- No PDF upload (raw files stay in paper-bank).
- If Zotero returns a different citation key, update `cite_key` in frontmatter.

### Step 13 — Generate refs.bib

```bash
python3 skills/paper-reader/scripts/generate_bibtex.py \
  "<WORK_ROOT>/manifests/paper_manifest.json" \
  --output "<VAULT_ROOT>/refs.bib"
```

### Step 14 — Validate extraction outputs

```bash
python3 skills/paper-reader/scripts/validate_extraction.py \
  --vault-root "<VAULT_ROOT>"
```

V2 validation checks (in addition to v1 checks):
- Catalog file exists per paper
- All per-section notes are non-empty and not in `status: draft`
- Summary note includes `## Knowledge Gaps` section
- `claims/<cite_key>.json` exists and follows v2 format
- No cite-key mismatch across notes, claims, and `refs.bib`

Highlight in handoff:
- any `metadata-only` papers
- any note with `source_parse_status != full`
- any papers added to `_papers-needing-download.md`
- any cite-key mismatch

### Step 15 — Self-improvement signal

If feedback from a prior run exists in `paper-bank/<cite_key>/_feedback.yaml`,
trigger the Level 2 improvement pass.

```bash
python3 skills/paper-reader/scripts/self_improve.py \
  --cite-key "<cite_key>" \
  --feedback "<PAPER_BANK>/<cite_key>/_feedback.yaml" \
  --constitution "skills/paper-reader/reading-constitution.md" \
  --proposals "skills/paper-reader/reading-constitution-proposals.md"
```

**Output:** `reading-constitution-proposals.md` updated with new rule candidates.

### Post-Processing Step: Reference Queue and Status Update

Run after all pipeline steps complete and vault notes are confirmed written.

#### PP1: Collect dummy-note-backed references

Read the session's dummy note write log. During comprehension, `dummy_note_writer.py`
creates or updates notes for papers deemed important enough to stub out. Collect
all cite_keys and arxiv_ids for which dummy notes were created OR updated in this
session. These are the only papers that enter the reference queue — not all
citations in the paper, only those the agent deemed important enough to note.

To collect: check the paper-bank run report at
`<WORK_ROOT>/logs/<cite_key>-run-report.json` for `dummy_notes_written` entries,
OR scan `citadel/literature/papers/` for notes whose `status: stub` or
`status: dummy` were written/updated today.

#### PP2: Write a local reference-queue patch file

**Concurrency strategy (Option A):** Each session writes a local patch file instead of
directly updating `reference-queue.md`. After all sessions in a batch complete, the
user merges patches manually (or via a merge step before the next batch trigger).

**Write patch file to:**
`$PAPER_BANK/rq-patches/<cite_key>-rq-patch.md`

**Patch file format:**

```
# Reference Queue Patch
# Session: <cite_key>
# Generated: <ISO timestamp>

| arxiv_id | cite_key | title | importance_score | sessions_cited | first_seen | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2401.00001 | smith2024foo | Foo paper | 1 | 1 | <today> | mentioned |
```

For each paper collected in PP1, write one row with:
- `importance_score`: always 1 (the merge step applies cumulative increments)
- `sessions_cited`: always 1 (same reason)
- `first_seen`: today's date
- `status`: `mentioned`

#### PP3: Update acquisition-list.md

Directly update the row for the current paper in
`$PAPER_BANK/acquisition-list.md`:
- Change `status` column from `downloaded` → `read`

Then append to `$PAPER_BANK/acquisition-log.md`:

```
<ISO timestamp> | read | <cite_key> | <arxiv_id> | pipeline complete
```

If `acquisition-list.md` does not exist or the cite_key is not found:
log a warning to the run report but do not fail — the paper-reader pipeline
result is not contingent on the acquisition list.

#### PP4: Archive prompt file

Move `$PAPER_BANK/prompts/<cite_key>-prompt.md` to
`$PAPER_BANK/prompts/done/<cite_key>-prompt.md` if it exists.

## Orchestration

The skill is run by an AI agent (Claude or compatible) that drives the full
pipeline — beginning with the reading plan stage (Step 0) — invoking scripts
for I/O operations and spawning subagents for comprehension steps.

**Reading plan stage:**
- Step 0 drafts and proofreads a structured `_reading_plan.md` before any
  execution begins. The plan is written to `paper-bank/<cite_key>/` first.
- Default mode: write the plan and proceed immediately (no user pause).
- Approval mode: write the plan, then wait for explicit user sign-off before
  executing. Activated only when the user requests it.
- The reading plan embeds a subagent prompt for each comprehension phase so
  the plan is self-contained and resumable after interruption.

**Comprehension execution modes:**

`comprehend_paper.py` is the comprehension orchestrator for Steps 6, 7, and 8.
It supports three modes:

1. **Inline (default):** Calls section reader scripts (`intro_reader.py`,
   `model_reader.py`, `method_reader.py`, `theory_reader.py`,
   `comprehend_empirical.py`) as subprocesses in the same session.
   Works end-to-end without spawning separate agent sessions. Readers use
   built-in heuristic extraction — no API keys or external services required.

2. **Subagent:** Produces a dispatch plan JSON. The calling agent is expected
   to spawn separate subagent sessions for each section, giving each one
   focused context. Higher quality but requires multi-session orchestration.

3. **Dry-run:** Plans dispatch without executing anything. Use `--dry-run`
   to verify the dispatch plan.

```bash
# Inline (default) — runs readers in-process:
python3 scripts/comprehend_paper.py \
  --cite-key "<cite_key>" \
  --paper-bank-root "<PAPER_BANK>" \
  --vault-root "<VAULT_ROOT>"

# Subagent — produces plan for agent to dispatch:
python3 scripts/comprehend_paper.py \
  --cite-key "<cite_key>" \
  --llm-dispatch subagent \
  --paper-bank-root "<PAPER_BANK>" \
  --vault-root "<VAULT_ROOT>"
```

**Graceful degradation:** If comprehension produces partial results (some
readers fail or run without LLM), downstream steps (`prepare_paper_note.py`)
write a vault note with `content_status: partial` and `review_status: draft`
rather than failing. The note contains whatever content was extracted, with
placeholders for missing sections.

**Resuming after manual comprehension:** If you complete comprehension manually
(e.g., wrote section notes by hand or via separate agent sessions), re-run the
pipeline skipping earlier steps:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_pipeline.py --cite-key "<cite_key>" \
  --resume-from vault_prepare
```

## Operational Rules

**Boundary rule — Citadel = knowledge vault; paper-bank = file store.**

- Citadel (`$VAULT_ROOT`) holds all knowledge artifacts: paper summary
  notes, per-section reading notes, concept notes, assumption notes, author notes,
  meta-notes, notation registry notes, dummy reference stubs, the catalog markdown
  file, the claims JSON, and refs.bib.
- Paper-bank (`$PAPER_BANK/`) holds raw source files, processed files
  (translated markdown, segments), and machine-readable structured data
  (`notation_dict.yaml`, `_vault-write-requests.json`, operational logs).
- Knowledge artifacts — even draft ones — live in Citadel from the moment they are
  created. Do not route knowledge artifacts through paper-bank.
- Cross-paper vault writes (wikilinks, concept notes, assumption notes, meta-note
  updates) go through knowledge-maester via `_vault-write-requests.json`. Do not
  write these directly from the pipeline.

**Faithfulness rules:**
- Do not fabricate claims, theorems, methodology, or bibliographic fields.
- Do not mutate discovery outputs in place.
- Every substantive claim in the v2 claims JSON must include `source_anchor` with
  `source_type`, `locator`, and `confidence`. If a locator cannot be resolved,
  use `locator: "not found"` and lower confidence.
- Connection claims must set `linked_paper_status` to `in-corpus` or
  `out-of-corpus`.
- `claims/<cite_key>.json` is authoritative when note markdown diverges.
- `metadata-only` notes must emit an empty `claims` array.

**Note formatting:**
- Use `$...$` for inline math and `$$...$$` for display math in markdown notes.

## Self-Improvement

The Reading Constitution (`reading-constitution.md`) defines Layer A reading
strategies. It is loaded by every comprehension subagent and version-stamped in
the catalog.

Feedback from completed runs is stored in `paper-bank/<cite_key>/_feedback.yaml`
and `_quiz_failures.yaml`. Step 15 processes feedback into proposed rule updates
in `reading-constitution-proposals.md`.

See `reading-constitution.md` for the current rule set and
`reading-constitution-proposals.md` for pending proposals.

## Summary Note Frontmatter Fields (additive)

The final summary note (`<cite_key>.md`) includes three additive frontmatter
fields introduced by the keyword/summary extraction pipeline. These fields
are purely additive — papers read before this feature was added are
unaffected (they have no `author_keywords`, `summary`, or `methods` fields,
which is valid).

| Field | Type | Source | Description |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| `author_keywords` | `list[str]` | `author_keywords.txt` (Step 3) or `intro.md` (Step 6) | Author-provided keywords extracted verbatim from the paper source |
| `summary` | `str` | Synthesized (Step 11) | One-to-two sentence TL;DR synthesized from section notes |
| `methods` | `list[str]` | `model.md` / `method.md` (Step 7) | Key statistical or computational methods identified during comprehension |
| `controlled_keywords` | `list[str]` | Assigned downstream by knowledge-maester | Normalized taxonomy keywords — **not assigned by paper-reader**; added by `knowledge-maester/scripts/normalize_keywords.py` after ingestion |

**Note:** `controlled_keywords` is documented here for completeness but is
**not** written by paper-reader. It is assigned downstream by the
knowledge-maester skill during post-ingestion keyword normalization. Paper-reader
only extracts the raw `author_keywords`; controlled vocabulary mapping is a
separate concern.

## Out Of Scope

- search, ranking, or manifest construction
- digest or field-summary generation
- survey drafting
- synthesis across multiple papers
- cross-paper vault operations (delegated to knowledge-maester)

## Acceptance

**Tier 1 — Unit tests (automated):**
```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s skills/paper-reader/tests -p 'test_*.py'
```

**Tier 2 — Integration (manual before release):**
```bash
python3 skills/paper-reader/scripts/preflight_extraction.py \
  --output "<WORK_ROOT>/preflight_report.json"
```

```bash
python3 skills/paper-reader/scripts/validate_extraction.py \
  --vault-root "<VAULT_ROOT>"
```

Run the full pipeline on at least one example paper (LaTeX path and PDF path).
Assert that:
- The catalog file exists per paper
- All per-section notes are non-empty and not in `status: draft`
- The summary note includes `## Knowledge Gaps`
- `claims/<cite_key>.json` exists in v2 format
- No cite-key mismatch across notes, claims, and `refs.bib`

**Tier 3 — Quality (human-in-the-loop):**
Read the generated summary note and mark it using the feedback form. A quality
test passes when the summary receives a non-failing verdict.
