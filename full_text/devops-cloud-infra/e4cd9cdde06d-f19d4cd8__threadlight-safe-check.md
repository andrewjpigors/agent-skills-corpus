  Three-lifecycle completeness gate for threadlight pilots
  (design / pre-deploy / post-deploy). Reads SPEC § 11c selectors via
  `specs/manifest.json` `deployment_manifest` and asserts: every
  selector maps to a deployed `Microsoft.*` type, every channel
  reaches, every scheduled job is wired. Post-deploy also runs
  behavioural checks: deployed images differ from the azuredocs
  helloworld placeholder, no ACA Job has its last 5 runs all Failed,
  App Insights exists when SPEC declared it.
  USE FOR: completeness gate, deploy gate, post-deploy gate,
  pre-deploy check, manifest drift, orphan modules, partial PoC,
  missing bot/workspace/aca-job, deployment_manifest, manifest.json,
  placeholder image, helloworld image, image probe, job execution
  failed, cron rot, app insights missing, telemetry not flowing,
  blank appin, Kratos export gate, trimmed infra, derive expected
  types from infra.
  DO NOT USE FOR: invocation/runtime tests (foundry-evals), `azd up`
  orchestration (threadlight-deploy), schema authoring
  (threadlight-design).

# Threadlight Safe Check — three lifecycle gates, one CLI

The single mandatory completeness gate for any threadlight pilot. Replaces
ad-hoc Phase 3 / Phase 3.5 checks scattered through `threadlight-deploy`
with one consolidated CLI you invoke at three lifecycle points:

```
post-design  → SPEC <-> manifest.json deployment_manifest contract
pre-deploy   → manifest <-> azure.yaml services <-> infra/main.bicep <-> src/<dir>/
post-deploy  → manifest <-> az resource list <-> channel reachability
```

> **Why this skill exists.** A recent investigation-style PoC
> shipped with **`aca-bot: yes`, `aca-job: yes`, `workspace-ui: yes`**
> in SPEC § 11c — and zero bot resources, zero jobs, zero workspace ACAs
> in the deployed resource group. `azd up` returned 0. Eval scores
> looked plausible. The gap was caught by the user opening the Azure
> Portal and noticing missing tiles. **A consolidated, mandatory gate
> would have caught this in 30 seconds.** That gate is this skill.
>
> **And then it shipped again, differently.** A later pilot
> using the `fetch-container-image` pattern had every resource type
> present in the resource group —
> `safe-check` returned `gaps: []` ✅ — but the MCP container was
> running `mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/containerapps-helloworld:latest`
> (Bicep had hard-coded the placeholder; `azd deploy mcp` was never
> run after the provision), and the deadline-watcher cron had
> 13 consecutive `Failed` executions. Structural-only checks aren't
> enough. The post-deploy phase now also runs **behavioural** checks:
> deployed images must NOT match the azuredocs placeholder regex,
> and no scheduled job may have its last 5 executions all `Failed`.

## What this skill does NOT replace

- **Invocation testing** of the agent → use `foundry-evals`
- **Authoring** the manifest → use `threadlight-design` (its
  `deployment_manifest{}` JSON block in `specs/manifest.json` is the
  contract this skill consumes)
- **Running `azd up`** → use `threadlight-deploy`. This skill is
  invoked **before** and **after** `azd up`, never instead of.

## When to invoke

| Lifecycle point | Phase | What's checked | Gate result |
|---|---|---|---|
| After SPEC + AGENTS.md drafted | `--phase design` | `specs/manifest.json` contains `deployment_manifest{}`; SPEC § 11c rows match `module_selectors` keys | Drift / fail |
| Before `azd up` | `--phase pre-deploy` | Every `yes` selector → wired in `azure.yaml` + `infra/main.bicep` + has `src/<dir>/Dockerfile`; no orphan Bicep / src folders | Fail-fast |
| After `azd up` returns 0 | `--phase post-deploy` | Every `expected_resource_types` entry in `az resource list`; required ACA roles by name pattern; **every deployed image is the real image (NOT the azuredocs placeholder)**; **no scheduled job has its last 5 executions all `Failed`**; all `channels` reach HTTP/JWT-OK; `scheduled_jobs` cron correct | **The non-negotiable gate.** Empty `gaps[]` = PoC complete |

Each phase emits a JSON manifest under `tests/` so the gate is auditable
and re-readable later (CI, demo prep, postmortem):

- `tests/safe-check-design-manifest.json`
- `tests/safe-check-predeploy-manifest.json`
- `tests/postdeploy-manifest.json` *(name preserved for backwards-compat with
  the prior `threadlight-deploy` Phase 3.5 manifest)*

All three manifests have a top-level `"gaps": []`. **Empty array = pass.**

---

## Kratos-export mode (valid input without `specs/manifest.json`)

A **Kratos-exported project** (`src/hosted-agent/` + `use-cases/<x>/`, trimmed
`infra/`) is a **valid input shape** even though it has no `specs/manifest.json`
`deployment_manifest{}` block. Detect it the same way `threadlight-deploy` does
(see [`docs/KRATOS-BRIDGE.md`](../../docs/KRATOS-BRIDGE.md)) and adapt:

- **Derive `expected_resource_types` from the export itself**, not from a SPEC
  manifest: walk the export's `infra/` (compiled Bicep) + `azure.yaml` services.
  Pass `--from-infra` (or point `--manifest` at a derived manifest) so the gate
  checks against what Kratos actually shipped, not a `threadlight-design` SPEC
  that does not exist here. This means **exit code 2 ("no `specs/manifest.json`")
  is NOT raised** for a recognized Kratos export.
- **Trimmed infra is intentional — do NOT flag as "missing module".** The Kratos
  exporter deliberately drops **APIM / AI Gateway** and the **multi-tenant
  frontend** module. Their absence is a **pass**, not a gap. Only treat APIM as
  expected if `citadel-spoke-onboarding` has since been layered on. Likewise a
  missing `workspace` ACA is only a gap once `threadlight-workspace-ui` has been
  invoked.
- **`required_aca_roles` collapses to `{"agent"}`** for a bare export — the
  single hosted-agent service. `bot` / `workspace` roles are required only after
  the corresponding Threadlight extension skill has been added.
- **`evals/` absence is expected** pre-backfill (Kratos `_SKIP_DIRS`); it is not
  a deploy defect. `threadlight-deploy` Kratos-export mode backfills it.

In short: recognize the export, check it against its own shipped infra, and treat
the documented trims as informational — never as gate failures.

## CLI

```bash
# From repo root
python3 tests/safe_check.py --phase design        # after threadlight-design Phase 1-3
python3 tests/safe_check.py --phase pre-deploy    # immediately before azd up
python3 tests/safe_check.py --phase post-deploy   # immediately after azd up returns 0
```

Exit codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Gate passed (gaps empty) |
| `1` | Gate failed (gaps non-empty); manifest written with details |
| `2` | Missing prerequisite (no `specs/manifest.json`, no `deployment_manifest{}` block, env vars missing) |
| `3` | Tooling error (Azure auth, `az` not on PATH, etc.) |

Optional flags:

```bash
--rg <name>           # override AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP env var (post-deploy)
--manifest <path>     # override default specs/manifest.json
--out <dir>           # override default tests/ output dir
--quiet               # only print final OK / FAIL line + exit code
```

## Files in this skill

```
threadlight-safe-check/
├── SKILL.md                       (this file)
└── scripts/
    └── safe_check.py              (single-file Python module — the CLI)
```

The CLI is **one file** (~250 LOC) intentionally — copy it into the pilot
repo as `tests/safe_check.py` (or symlink / install as a package) and
invoke. No external dependencies beyond stdlib + `azure-identity` (for
`AzureCliCredential`-honored `az` calls already required by everything
else in the toolchain).

---

## Phase 1 — `--phase design` (post-design check)

**Inputs:** `specs/SPEC.md`, `specs/manifest.json`

**Asserts:**

1. `specs/manifest.json` exists and parses as JSON.
2. Top-level `deployment_manifest{}` block present (added by
   `threadlight-design` Phase 3 — see `threadlight-design/SKILL.md`
   §3 for the schema).
3. `deployment_manifest.module_selectors` is a `dict[str, "yes"|"no"]`
   covering every selector named in SPEC § 11c table.
4. `deployment_manifest.services[]` lists every service that needs a
   container image; every entry has `name`, `host`, `src`.
5. `deployment_manifest.scheduled_jobs[]` listed iff `aca-job: yes`.
6. `deployment_manifest.channels[]` lists every Human Interaction
   channel from SPEC § 8.
7. `deployment_manifest.expected_resource_types[]` non-empty and
   contains the canonical `Microsoft.*` type for every `yes` selector
   per the table in **Selector → resource type map** below.

**Common gaps caught:**

- SPEC § 11c says `aca-bot: yes` but `module_selectors` doesn't list it
  (drift between SPEC text and manifest contract)
- `services[]` references `src/workspace` but SPEC § 8 has no UI
  channel (orphan service)
- `expected_resource_types[]` missing `Microsoft.BotService/botServices`
  even though `aca-bot: yes` (selector mapping incomplete)

---

## Phase 2 — `--phase pre-deploy` (pre-`azd up` check)

**Inputs:** `specs/manifest.json`, `azure.yaml`, `infra/main.bicep`,
`infra/**/*.bicep`, `src/**/Dockerfile`

**Asserts:** Three-column matrix per `yes` selector — every column
populated:

| Selector | `azure.yaml` services | `infra/main.bicep` module ref | `src/<dir>/` Dockerfile |
|---|---|---|---|
| `aca-mcp` | `name: mcp`, `host: containerapp`, `project: ./src/mcp` | `module mcpApp '...container-app.bicep'` with `serviceName: 'mcp'` | `src/mcp/Dockerfile` + `server.py` |
| `aca-bot` | `name: bot`, `host: containerapp`, `project: ./src/bot` | `module botApp '...container-app.bicep'` with `serviceName: 'bot'` **AND** `module botService 'bot/bot-service.bicep'` | `src/bot/Dockerfile` + `bot.py` + `app.py` + `teams_package/manifest.json` |
| `aca-job` | `name: <job>`, `host: containerapp`, `project: ./src/jobs/<job>` | `module job 'jobs/aca-job.bicep'` (or equivalent under `infra/jobs/`) | `src/jobs/<job>/Dockerfile` + `main.py` (cron entrypoint) |
| `workspace-ui` | `name: workspace`, `host: containerapp`, `project: ./src/workspace` | `module workspaceApp '...container-app.bicep'` with `serviceName: 'workspace'` | `src/workspace/Dockerfile` + ACA-served HTML/SPA. **NOT a static `index.html` only.** |
| `foundry-iq-index` | n/a (provisioned by hook) | `module knowledge 'modules/ai-search.bicep'` (the index) | `scripts/postprovision.py` calls `provision_knowledge_base()` |

Plus **two orphan checks** (caught orphan
`infra/bot/aca.bicep` files left for an entire deploy cycle):

1. **Bicep-module orphan check.** Every `infra/<dir>/*.bicep` (excluding
   `core/`, `modules/`) must be referenced from `infra/main.bicep` via
   `module ... '<path>'`. Otherwise → orphan; either wire or delete.
2. **`src/`-folder orphan check.** Every `src/<dir>/` must map to a
   declared `azure.yaml` service (or be `src/agent/` which has its own
   host). Otherwise → orphan; either wire or delete.

**Common gaps caught:**

- `aca-bot: yes` but `azure.yaml` has no `bot` service → silent partial
  PoC
- `infra/bot/aca.bicep` exists but no `module botApp` line in
  `main.bicep` → ghost module that looks deployed in `infra/` listing
  but never lands in Azure
- `src/workspace/index.html` exists but no `src/workspace/Dockerfile`
  → static page treated as "deployed" with nowhere to run

---

## Phase 3 — `--phase post-deploy` (post-`azd up` gate, MANDATORY)

> This is the gate that catches "azd reported success but half the
> SPEC didn't ship".

**Inputs:** `specs/manifest.json`, `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP` (env var or
`--rg`), live Azure subscription via `az`/`AzureCliCredential`.

### Step 1 — capture deployed state

```bash
RG="${AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP:-$(azd env get-value AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP)}"

az resource list -g "$RG" \
   --query "[].{type:type, name:name}" -o json > tests/deployed-resources.json

az containerapp list -g "$RG" \
   --query "[].{name:name, fqdn:properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn, state:properties.runningStatus}" \
   -o json > tests/deployed-containerapps.json

az containerapp job list -g "$RG" \
   --query "[].{name:name, schedule:properties.configuration.scheduleTriggerConfig.cronExpression}" \
   -o json > tests/deployed-jobs.json

# IMPORTANT: `az bot list` does NOT exist. Use the generic resource API:
az resource list -g "$RG" \
   --resource-type Microsoft.BotService/botServices \
   -o json > tests/deployed-bots.json
```

### Step 2 — diff against `expected_resource_types`

```python
expected_types = set(manifest["deployment_manifest"]["expected_resource_types"])
deployed_types = {r["type"] for r in deployed_resources}
missing_types = expected_types - deployed_types
```

> **Kratos-export mode.** When there is no `specs/manifest.json` but the project
> is a recognized Kratos export, derive `expected_types` from the export's own
> compiled `infra/` + `azure.yaml` services instead (see § Kratos-export mode).
> Do **not** add APIM / multi-tenant-FE to `expected_types` — they are
> intentionally trimmed, so their absence must not surface in `missing_types`.

### Step 3 — required-role check (catches "right type wrong name")

For each ACA, assert at least one matches each required role pattern.
This catches "we deployed *some* ACA but it's the MCP again, not the
bot".

```python
required_aca_roles = {"mcp", "bot", "workspace"}   # subset of services per manifest
present_roles = set()
for aca in deployed_acas:
    for role in required_aca_roles:
        if role in aca["name"].lower():
            present_roles.add(role)
unmet = required_aca_roles - present_roles
```

### Step 3.5 — image-probe (catches placeholder-image leak)

> **Behavioural check.** Type/name/role can all match while the actual
> code running is Microsoft's `containerapps-helloworld` sample —
> typically because Bicep hard-coded the placeholder image and nobody
> ran `azd deploy <service>` after provision (or the
> `fetch-container-image` pattern was missing for that ACA module).
> `azd up` reports SUCCESS. The agent's `tool_selection` evals collapse.
> The deadline-watcher 404s. The structural gate is silent.

For every entry in `deployed_acas + deployed_jobs`, query
`properties.template.containers[0].image` and FAIL if it matches
`PLACEHOLDER_IMAGE_REGEX = ^mcr\.microsoft\.com/azuredocs/.*`:

```python
PLACEHOLDER_IMAGE_REGEX = re.compile(r"^mcr\.microsoft\.com/azuredocs/.*", re.IGNORECASE)

for resource in deployed_acas + deployed_jobs:
    image = resource.get("image", "")
    if not image:
        gaps.append(f"image-probe {resource['name']!r}: az returned no image string")
    elif PLACEHOLDER_IMAGE_REGEX.match(image):
        gaps.append(
            f"image-probe {resource['name']!r} is running the azuredocs helloworld "
            f"placeholder. Run `azd deploy <service>` and apply the fetch-container-image "
            f"pattern in infra/ (see threadlight-deploy Gotchas)."
        )
```

The probe records every checked resource under `image_probe[]` in
`postdeploy-manifest.json` so a non-placeholder image is auditable
later (you can grep "PLACEHOLDER" across past gates).

### Step 4 — channel reachability

For every entry in `deployment_manifest.channels[]`:

| Channel `type` | Probe |
|---|---|
| `web` (workspace) | `GET https://<fqdn>/` returns HTTP 200 (and optionally `/health` returns "ok") |
| `teams` (bot) | `POST https://<fqdn>/api/messages` with empty body → expect HTTP 401 with `Authorization header not found` (= JWT middleware live) |
| `email` / `webhook` | n/a (deferred — only logs presence) |

### Step 5 — scheduled-job cron correctness

For every entry in `deployment_manifest.scheduled_jobs[]`:

```python
for job in manifest_jobs:
    matched = next((j for j in deployed_jobs if job["name"] in j["name"]), None)
    if not matched:
        gaps.append(f"missing scheduled job: {job['name']}")
    elif matched["schedule"] != job["schedule"]:
        gaps.append(f"job {job['name']} cron drift: deployed={matched['schedule']} expected={job['schedule']}")
```

### Step 5.5 — job execution-success (catches silent cron rot)

> **Behavioural check.** A job can be deployed with the right name,
> right cron, right image — and crash on every single tick. ACA Jobs
> don't surface the failure in `azd up` output, the schedule continues
> firing on time, and the only signal is execution-history showing
> nothing but red. We saw 13 consecutive `Failed` executions over 3.5
> hours before catching it manually.

For every deployed ACA Job, fetch the last `JOB_EXECUTION_WINDOW = 5`
executions (sorted by `startTime`); if all 5 are `status=Failed`, the
cron is dead and the gate trips:

```python
for job in deployed_jobs:
    execs = az(
        "containerapp", "job", "execution", "list", "-n", job["name"], "-g", rg,
        "--query", "sort_by([], &properties.startTime)[-5:]"
                   ".{name:name,status:properties.status}",
        "-o", "json",
    )
    statuses = [e["status"] for e in execs]
    if statuses and all(s == "Failed" for s in statuses):
        gaps.append(
            f"job-success {job['name']!r}: last {len(execs)} executions ALL Failed. "
            f"Cron is dead even though deploy succeeded — investigate replica logs "
            f"and image entrypoint."
        )
```

If a job has zero executions yet (just deployed, schedule hasn't fired
yet), `job_health[].status` records `no_executions_yet` and **does NOT**
trip the gate (false-positive avoidance). It will trip on the next
post-deploy run if the job stays red.

### Step 5.6 — App Insights existence (catches silent observability gap)

The biggest "azd up returned 0 but the demo is dark" failure mode caught
in Phase 25: deployed PoC ships with no telemetry at all because the
`app-insights.bicep` module was never composed into `infra/main.bicep`.
Hosted agent runs, MCP serves tools, cron ticks — but App Insights stays
empty. The smoke probe `first-trace-probe.kql` returns 0 rows and nobody
notices until a customer asks "where are the traces?".

If `module_selectors.app-insights == "yes"` (or `expected_resource_types`
includes `Microsoft.Insights/components`), the gate runs:

```python
appin_resources = az resource list -g <rg> \
    --resource-type Microsoft.Insights/components -o json
if not appin_resources:
    gaps.append("appin-existence: SPEC declared app-insights but NO ...")
```

The probe records every checked resource under `appin_health[]`. If SPEC
did NOT declare AppIn, the check is a no-op and records
`{"status":"not_required_by_spec","note":"…"}` so the auditor sees it
was considered.

> **Threadlight default:** `app-insights` should always be in
> `module_selectors`. Add `Microsoft.Insights/components` to
> `expected_resource_types`. See `foundry-observability` skill for the
> drop-in `app-insights.bicep` + `log-analytics.bicep` modules and the
> postprovision script that connects the Foundry account to AppIn so
> hosted-agent traces flow.

### Step 5.7 — Bot AUTHTYPE (catches silent UAMI auth misconfig)

> **Behavioural check.** A bot can be deployed with the right Bot
> Service registration (`appType: UserAssignedMSI`, `msaAppId =
> UAMI clientId`), the right ACA running, the right JWT middleware
> alive (Step 4 channel probe returns `OK_jwt_alive`) — and STILL
> return HTTP 500 with `AADSTS7000216` on **every real Teams message**.
>
> Why? Because the `microsoft-agents-*` SDK reads
> `CONNECTIONS__SERVICE_CONNECTION__SETTINGS__AUTHTYPE` at startup to
> decide which MSAL flow to use. **If missing**, it defaults to
> `ConfidentialClient`, which demands a `client_secret` the keyless
> deploy never provisioned. Step 4's synthetic JWT probe doesn't catch
> this because the JWT middleware fires BEFORE the outbound token
> acquisition path. So the channel is "reachable" but every real
> message fails.
>
> Origin: recent pilot retrospective — 4 hours of bot-can't-talk-to-Teams.

For every Bot Service in the RG with `appType=UserAssignedMSI`, the
gate locates the matching ACA (name pattern `*bot*`), reads its env
block, and asserts the `AUTHTYPE` env var is present with the literal
string `UserManagedIdentity`:

```python
for bot_svc in deployed_bots:
    props = az("bot", "show", "-g", rg, "-n", bot_svc["name"], ...)
    if props["appType"] != "UserAssignedMSI":
        continue   # not UAMI-mode, skip
    bot_aca = next((a for a in deployed_acas if "bot" in a["name"].lower()), None)
    env = az("containerapp", "show", "-g", rg, "-n", bot_aca["name"],
             "--query", "properties.template.containers[0].env[]", ...)
    authtype = next((v for v in env if v["name"] ==
                     "CONNECTIONS__SERVICE_CONNECTION__SETTINGS__AUTHTYPE"),
                    {}).get("value", "")
    if authtype != "UserManagedIdentity":
        gaps.append(
            f"bot-authtype {bot_aca['name']!r}: appType=UserAssignedMSI "
            f"but AUTHTYPE={authtype!r} (expected 'UserManagedIdentity'). "
            f"MSAL will fall back to ConfidentialClient → AADSTS7000216 "
            f"on every Teams message."
        )
```

The probe records every checked bot under `bot_auth_health[]`. If the
SPEC did NOT declare `aca-bot`, the check is skipped silently. If
`Bot Service.appType != UserAssignedMSI` (e.g. multi-tenant w/ secret
explicitly chosen), the check is also skipped — this only enforces the
contract the threadlight pattern actually uses.

> **Quick fix when caught:**
> ```bash
> az containerapp update -g <rg> -n <bot-aca> \
>   --set-env-vars CONNECTIONS__SERVICE_CONNECTION__SETTINGS__AUTHTYPE=UserManagedIdentity
> ```
> AND patch `infra/main.bicep` (or whichever Bicep wires the bot ACA env
> block) so the next `azd provision` doesn't drop it again. See
> `foundry-teams-bot` skill § Bicep snippet — all FOUR
> `CONNECTIONS__SERVICE_CONNECTION__SETTINGS__*` vars are mandatory.

### Step 5.8 — Cosmos data realism (catches "deployed empty, agent says not found")

> **Behavioural check.** A Cosmos-backed pilot can deploy cleanly
> (`azd up` returns 0, all containers exist, MCP server reachable) and
> STILL have the agent reply "case not found" / "no records" on every
> realistic prompt — because **the containers are empty**. The eval
> dataset writes a handful of synthetic IDs as a side-effect of probe
> traffic, but the realistic golden cases that live in
> `specs/sample-data/*.json` are never loaded unless `Phase 6.5` of
> `threadlight-deploy` ran the seed step.
>
> Origin: recent pilot retrospective — document containers shipped with
> **0 documents**; case containers had only eval-probe IDs
> (`CASE-S001`, `CASE-S-007`, etc.) instead of realistic golden cases
> (`CASE-<id>`, `<example-customer>`, etc.) declared in
> `specs/sample-data/`. User
> typed realistic IDs; agent honestly reported "not found"; demo
> looked broken.

For every Cosmos container declared in SPEC § 5b with
`seed_from: sample-data` (or matching a `kyc-*`, `case-*`, `dispute-*`,
`order-*`, etc. pattern indicating it MUST hold demo data), the gate
counts documents and asserts non-zero:

```python
# Pseudocode — actual implementation in safe_check/cosmos_data_check.py
expected_seeded = [
    {"container": c["name"], "min_docs": c.get("min_docs", 1)}
    for c in spec_section_5b
    if c.get("seed_from") == "sample-data"
]

cosmos = CosmosClient(endpoint, credential=AzureCliCredential())
db = cosmos.get_database_client(spec_database_name)
for spec in expected_seeded:
    cont = db.get_container_client(spec["container"])
    # NOTE: enable_cross_partition_query was dropped in azure-cosmos>=4.15 async.
    # Cross-partition is now inferred when partition_key is omitted.
    # See foundry-mcp-aca SKILL.md "azure-cosmos>=4.15" callout.
    count = list(cont.query_items(
        query="SELECT VALUE COUNT(1) FROM c",
    ))[0]
    if count < spec["min_docs"]:
        gaps.append(
            f"cosmos-data-realism {spec['container']!r}: {count} docs "
            f"(expected ≥{spec['min_docs']} from sample-data). "
            f"Run scripts/seed_data.py — see threadlight-deploy Phase 6.5."
        )
```

The probe records every checked container under `cosmos_data_health[]`
with `count`, `min_docs`, `pass`. Gate fails (exit 1) if ANY container
is below its declared minimum.

> **Quick fix when caught:**
> ```bash
> # Grant data-plane RBAC if not already (one-time):
> az cosmosdb sql role assignment create -g $RG -a $COSMOS \
>   --role-definition-id "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002" \
>   --principal-id "$(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv)" \
>   --scope "$(az cosmosdb show -g $RG -n $COSMOS --query id -o tsv)"
> sleep 30
>
> # Run the seed:
> uv run scripts/seed_data.py
> ```
> AND patch `azure.yaml` `hooks.postdeploy` to invoke the seed
> automatically on every `azd up` (see `threadlight-deploy` SKILL.md
> § Phase 6.5 Step 3).

### Step 5.9 — Cosmos firewall pilot-posture (catches "PNA drifted to Disabled")

> **Behavioural check.** A Cosmos-backed pilot can deploy cleanly
> (`azd up` returns 0, the Cosmos account exists, the Bicep declared
> `publicNetworkAccess: Enabled`) and STILL fail at the seed step

For every Cosmos account in the RG (when SPEC § 11c selects
`cosmos-db: yes`), the gate asserts `publicNetworkAccess: Enabled`:

```python
for acct in az("cosmosdb", "list", "-g", rg, ...):
    if acct["publicNetworkAccess"] == "Disabled":
        gaps.append(
            f"cosmos-firewall {acct['name']!r}: PNA=Disabled. Seed "
            f"scripts and operator workstations CANNOT reach Cosmos. "
            f"Pilot fix: az cosmosdb update --public-network-access "
            f"Enabled. Permanent fix: Bicep cosmos-db.bicep with "
            f"pilotPosture=true."
        )
```

The probe records every checked Cosmos account under
`cosmos_firewall_health[]` with `publicNetworkAccess`,
`networkAclBypass`, `ipRules`, and `status`. If the SPEC did NOT
declare `cosmos-db`, the check is skipped silently.

### Why both structural AND behavioural checks

The first three steps (resource types, role keywords, channel reach)
are **structural** — they answer *"is the right shape of resource
present?"*. Recent pilots failed on these and the gate caught
it.

Steps 3.5, 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7 are **behavioural** — they answer *"is the right
code running, is it not crashing, is telemetry actually landing, and can the
bot actually talk back to Teams?"*.
Recent pilots passed all structural checks but had MCP running
the helloworld placeholder, the cron failing every 15 min, and zero
traces in AppIn (because the AppIn resource was never even provisioned).
Recent pilots passed all structural checks AND the JWT-alive channel probe,
but the bot returned HTTP 500 on every real Teams message because the
`AUTHTYPE` env var was missing. Structural checks alone weren't enough;
the behavioural checks close that loop.

Both layers are cheap (single `az` call per resource) and run on the
same schedule (post-deploy hook). There's no scenario where you want
one but not the other — the gate fails fast on either.

---

## Selector → resource type map (canonical)

The `deployment_manifest.expected_resource_types[]` list a
`threadlight-design` author writes is mechanically derived from this
table. Safe-check uses the same table for the post-deploy diff.

| Selector | Expected `Microsoft.*` resource types |
|---|---|
| `foundry-account` | `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts` |
| `cosmos-db` | `Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts` |
| `ai-search` | `Microsoft.Search/searchServices` |
| `app-insights` | `Microsoft.Insights/components` + `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces` |
| `acr` | `Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries` |
| `uami` | `Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities` |
| `aca-environment` | `Microsoft.App/managedEnvironments` |
| `aca-mcp` | `Microsoft.App/containerApps` (1+ named `*mcp*`) |
| `aca-bot` | `Microsoft.App/containerApps` (1+ named `*bot*`) **AND** `Microsoft.BotService/botServices` |
| `aca-job` | `Microsoft.App/jobs` (1 per cron entry) |
| `workspace-ui` | `Microsoft.App/containerApps` (1+ named `*workspace*` or `*ui*`) |
| `event-grid` | `Microsoft.EventGrid/topics` (or `systemTopics`) |
| `service-bus` | `Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces` |
| `key-vault` | `Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults` (only if explicitly `yes` — keyless-by-default) |
| `storage-blob` | `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts` |
| `foundry-iq-index` | `Microsoft.Search/searchServices` (typically same as `ai-search`) |

## Windows-specific quirks (BAKED IN)

These are **must-handle** on Windows shells running Azure CLI; they
silently break naive `subprocess.run(["az", ...])` calls. The shipped
`safe_check.py` includes all three workarounds.

### 1. `az` is `az.cmd`, not `az.exe` — needs `shell=True`

`subprocess.run(["az", "resource", "list", ...])` on Windows fails with
`[WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified` because Python
won't traverse `PATHEXT` for a non-`.exe`. Use:

```python
subprocess.run(["az", "resource", "list", ...], shell=True, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
```

`shell=True` lets cmd.exe resolve `az.cmd` from `PATHEXT`. Yes,
shell=True is normally an injection risk — here all args are
hard-coded or come from `azd env get-value` (not user input).

### 2. `az bot list` does NOT exist

The Bot Service CLI exposes `az bot show -n <name> -g <rg>` per
resource, not a list. To enumerate bots in a RG, use the generic
resource API:

```bash
az resource list -g <rg> --resource-type Microsoft.BotService/botServices -o json
```

### 3. `az` honors `AZURE_CONFIG_DIR` only if env vars set in *parent*

The Python process inherits parent env vars, but if `AZURE_CONFIG_DIR`
isn't set in the shell that launches `python3 tests/safe_check.py`,
`az` falls back to `~/.azure` and reads the wrong tenant. Per
`azure-tenant-isolation`: set both `AZURE_CONFIG_DIR` and
`AZD_CONFIG_DIR` in the shell before invoking this gate.

The CLI itself logs the active tenant + subscription as its first line
of output, so any cross-tenant slip is immediately visible.

---

## Bot health-check semantics

A bot ACA returning HTTP 401 with body `{"error": "Authorization header
not found"}` from `POST /api/messages` is the **healthy "alive and
rejecting" state**. The microsoft-agents SDK's
`jwt_authorization_middleware` is correctly enforcing Bot Framework
token validation. `safe_check.py` records this as `"status":
"OK_jwt_alive"`, NOT a gap.

To smoke-test the bot end-to-end, use either:

- the Bot Framework Emulator (local, manual), or
- a Teams sideload via the generated `teams_package/manifest.json`

Both are out of scope for this gate (covered by `foundry-teams-bot`).

---

## Hooking into `azd up`

Add to `azure.yaml`:

```yaml
hooks:
    predeploy:
        shell: pwsh
        run: python3 tests/safe_check.py --phase pre-deploy
    postdeploy:
        shell: pwsh
        run: |
            cd scripts
            uv sync --frozen --quiet
            uv run postdeploy.py     # existing seed script
            cd ..
            python3 tests/safe_check.py --phase post-deploy
```

`predeploy` exits 1 → `azd deploy` aborts before the `docker build`,
saving 5+ minutes of wasted ACR push when a service is missing.

`postdeploy` runs after `azd up` reports success — but before the human
declares "PoC complete". A non-zero exit here is the **single most
important signal** in the threadlight toolchain: it means SPEC said one
thing and Azure shipped another. Don't dismiss it.

---

## Anti-pattern: "the agent runs in the portal so we're done"

The PoC is **NOT done** when:

- Only the hosted agent + 1 MCP ACA are deployed but SPEC § 11c
  declared more (`aca-bot`, `aca-job`, `workspace-ui`).
- The smoke probe / eval invokes the agent successfully but the
  agent's deployed surface area doesn't match SPEC § 8 channels.
- Bicep modules are present in `infra/` but not wired into
  `main.bicep` (orphans).
- Source folders exist under `src/` but aren't declared in
  `azure.yaml` services.
- `tests/postdeploy-manifest.json` doesn't exist or has non-empty
  `gaps[]`.

If any of the above is true, the PoC is **partial**. Communicate that
honestly to the user (with the gap list from `safe-check`) instead of
declaring victory.
