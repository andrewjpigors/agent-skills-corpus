# Alva

Alva is an agentic finance platform. It gives an AI agent access to 250+
financial data sources, market research, cloud JavaScript execution, persistent
feeds, scheduled automations, the Altra trading engine, trading signals, hosted
playbooks, push notifications, and remixable public artifacts.

This file is the platform encyclopedia and operating guide. Read it to
understand what Alva can do, how the concepts fit together, which path a user
request belongs to, and which focused reference owns the detailed procedure. It
is intentionally not the full playbook-building manual. Long command sequences,
API gotchas, release checklists, design rules, examples, and debugging recipes
live in `references/`.

## Mental Model

Alva turns finance work into durable, inspectable pipelines. The agent should
not be the data source; the agent builds the pipeline that fetches data, checks
shape, computes outputs, persists them, and renders or explains the result.

The main objects are:

| Concept            | Meaning                                                                                                                                                      | Read when                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Skills        | 250+ structured Arrays endpoints for equities, options, crypto, macro, on-chain, semiconductor spot prices, news, prediction markets, and indexed Twitter/X. | You need factual financial data.                                                                               |
| Runtime script     | JavaScript executed inside Alva's V8/jagent runtime through `alva run` or cronjobs.                                                                          | You need computation, HTTP, ALFS, secrets, alpi, ONNX, or Feed SDK.                                            |
| Feed               | The persistent data pipeline and identity (`feed_id`) that writes outputs to ALFS. `alva automation` is its product-facing lifecycle CLI; `alva deploy` cronjobs produce its data. | Data needs freshness, history, public reads, charts, release, or push.                                         |
| Playbook           | A hosted investing app at `https://alva.ai/u/<username>/playbooks/<name>`.                                                                                   | The user wants a shareable dashboard, screener, thesis, what-if, or strategy surface.                          |
| Skillhub blueprint | A catalog methodology addressed by `/use-skill:<username>/<name>` or discovered from a user skill/method reference.                                          | The user references a skill/method, or a task matches an official template family.                             |
| Altra              | The Feed SDK trading engine for event-driven backtesting and signal feeds.                                                                                   | Any strategy, simulation, signal target, portfolio, order, equity curve, or rebalancing logic.                 |
| alpi               | A fixed LLM reasoning/tool loop inside a deterministic scheduled pipeline.                                                                                   | A feed needs classification, synthesis, TLDR, why-it-matters, or result-only tool use over real upstream data. |
| BYOD               | User-supplied or validated external data source wired into runtime code.                                                                                     | Alva coverage is insufficient after verification.                                                              |

Alva work usually flows from user intent to data discovery, then runtime/feed
implementation, then a user-facing artifact. A direct answer may stop after a
fresh data fetch. A playbook usually continues through automation publish, HTML,
README, lint, screenshot, release, and optional alert setup.

The stack is layered:

1. **Discovery layer**: Data Skills, runtime SDK docs, Skillhub blueprints, and
   public playbook discovery tell the agent what exists now.
2. **Computation layer**: jagent runtime scripts, `net/http`, secrets, alpi,
   ONNX, and Altra transform source data into repeatable outputs.
3. **Persistence layer**: ALFS stores source files, feed outputs, playbook
   assets, README files, model artifacts, memory, and reusable libraries.
4. **Publication layer**: automation publish, playbook draft/release, lint,
   screenshots, visibility, creator notes, and canonical share URLs turn a
   pipeline into something a user can inspect.
5. **Action layer**: alerts, signal feeds, trading execution, and alert bindings
   connect the artifact to ongoing decisions.

Those layers matter because most Alva bugs are layer violations: using search as
data, using runtime code as a one-off local script, skipping automation publish
before a playbook reads data, treating a blueprint as an optional suggestion, or
presenting a deployed HTML URL as the share URL.

Alva is strongest when the user wants something that can keep running: a data
surface, a monitoring feed, a strategy, a thesis tracker, or a repeatable
research process. It is also useful for single-shot questions, but the agent
should not overbuild. A user asking "what is BTC doing now?" needs a fresh fetch
and a concise answer. A user asking "track BTC dominance and alert me on
breakouts" needs a feed, cadence, push sidecar, and verification.

Think in artifacts:

- **Answer**: a direct response grounded in fresh data. No feed or release
  required unless the user asks for persistence.
- **Script**: an Alva Cloud computation that may be run manually or scheduled.
- **Feed**: the persistent output of a script, with schema, history, grants, and
  release metadata.
- **Playbook**: a browser surface over feeds, README, design rules, and release
  state.
- **Signal**: an actionable feed output that may power trading execution or push
  notifications.
- **Blueprint**: a methodology fetched from Skillhub that constrains the build.

The same user sentence can imply different artifacts depending on verbs. "Ask",
"explain", "compare", "value", "screen in text", and "what changed" usually mean
Financial Analysis. "Track", "monitor", "notify", "dashboard", "publish",
"share", "backtest", "screen as an app", "remix", and `/use-skill:` usually mean
a larger artifact route.

## Capability Help

When the user asks who Alva is, what Alva can do, how to use Alva, or asks for
starter prompts, answer from the capability map rather than implementation
internals. Use user-facing groups such as Ask market questions, Set alerts,
Build/remix Playbooks, Discover/manage Playbooks, and Connect accounts.

Offer 3 concrete starter prompts when helpful. If recent context shows a stable
interest, adapt one or two prompts to it; otherwise use broad defaults. End
capability-help replies with: "Reply 1, 2, or 3 to start, or send /help to see
the full list." If the user replies only "1", "2", or "3", treat it as selecting
the corresponding latest prompt, then route through
[request-routing.md](references/request-routing.md).

## First Principles

These rules are the high-signal foundation. If you only remember one section,
make it this one.

1. **Help-first CLI.** Before using any `alva` command you have not used in this
   session, run `alva <command> --help`. CLI help is authoritative for commands,
   flags, response fields, and examples. Read
   [preflight.md](references/preflight.md) at session start.
2. **Fresh identity and memory.** Run `alva whoami`, capture `username`,
   `subscription_tier`, delivery channel fields, and Arrays JWT status. Load
   `~/memory/MEMORY.md` if not already read. Memory is a *claim*, not truth.
3. **Pipeline, not oracle.** Financial values must come from Data Skills,
   published Alva feeds, or validated BYOD sources. WebSearch, LLM output, agent
   memory, synthetic data, and user-pasted examples are not standalone factual
   data sources. Read [content-legitimacy.md](references/content-legitimacy.md).
4. **No stale surface assumptions.** Fetch Data Skills endpoint docs, Skillhub
   blueprints, CLI help, and runtime docs in the current session. Do not act
   from remembered field names.
5. **User scope is sacred.** Write, deploy, draft, release, and visibility
   operations target only the requesting user's namespace from `alva whoami`
   unless the user explicitly asks for cross-user work such as remix lineage.
6. **Altra for trading.** Any backtest, portfolio simulation, target signal,
   equity curve, order logic, position tracking, or rebalancing uses Altra.
   Hand-rolled loops invite bad timestamps and look-ahead bias.
7. **Playbooks are live by default.** If a playbook displays numbers, charts,
   tables, or metric cards, HTML reads feed outputs at runtime through
   `AlvaToolkit.AlvaClient` and release declares the backing feeds. Static
   snapshots are only for explicit requests.
8. **One blocking question.** For nontrivial builds, ask at most one blocking
   question or present one short plan. A concrete Skillhub directive or
   user-referenced skill/method plus topic means plan once after retrieval, then
   build.
9. **References own depth.** Top-level sections tell you what the capability is,
   what rule is easy to miss, and which file to open. Long examples, commands,
   and checklists live in the linked reference.

Two consequences are worth making explicit. First, a useful Alva answer can be
small: a financial-analysis question should not become a playbook unless the
user asks for a durable surface. Second, a useful Alva build can be large: once
the user does ask for a playbook, the job is not done at "HTML exists"; it is
done when data provenance, release metadata, README, lint, screenshot, and share
URL all match the user's goal.

## Session Start

Before doing Alva work, open [preflight.md](references/preflight.md). It owns:

- `scripts/version_check.sh`
- `alva --help` and help-first command use
- CLI install / upgrade
- `alva whoami`, subscription tier, username, delivery fields
- `ARRAYS_JWT` status and `alva arrays token ensure`
- `~/memory/MEMORY.md` loading
- user-scope enforcement

Use [user-facing-prose.md](references/user-facing-prose.md) for product
vocabulary and voice before writing Financial Analysis answers, playbook copy,
README prose, visible HTML text, alpi prompts, digests, or release descriptions.
User-facing words include **automation**, **playbook**, **alert/notification**,
**Agent**, and **script**. Treat **feed** as internal unless the user is looking
at logs, raw data, API fields, release references, or an Automation detail that
exposes it.

Use [creators-note.md](references/creators-note.md) when composing a pinned
post-release author note.

## Alva Knowledge (Required Reading)

Before designing, modifying, or evaluating any automation, read
[alva-knowledge.md](references/alva-knowledge.md). Every automation must decide
whether bounded history improves its output; longitudinal or decision
automations use that history, and push-capable automations also define semantic
notification novelty.

## Request Routing

Open [request-routing.md](references/request-routing.md) whenever the task is
not an obvious single-fetch answer. It owns route selection, Skillhub, Guided
Planning, capability verification, and completion gates.

Open [operational-pitfalls.md](references/operational-pitfalls.md) step by step
whenever the route enters runtime, feed, ALFS, playbook HTML, deploy, release,
chart, or cron work. Read only the relevant section before each step, but treat
that section as mandatory, not optional debugging material.

## Capability Boundaries

Alva has broad coverage, but the boundaries are part of the product contract.
Naming them early prevents wasted build time.

**Structured data vs search.** Data Skills are for deterministic datasets and
repeatable fields. Search is for source-backed context, non-US finance, global
X/Grok search, and off-catalog assets. Search results may inform a feed or a
source-cited answer, but they do not become raw chart data by being pasted into
HTML.

**Runtime vs local agent.** Runtime code runs on Alva Cloud, not on the agent's
machine. It cannot use local filesystem paths, shell commands, Node builtins, or
environment variables. If a task must be durable, scheduled, public, or
feed-backed, verify it in Alva runtime rather than only locally.

**Feed vs playbook.** A feed is the data contract; a playbook is the UI and
distribution surface. A beautiful playbook with stale or unreleased feeds is not
complete. A good feed with no user-facing surface may be enough for an internal
automation or direct data product.

**alpi vs data.** alpi can turn real upstream data into narrative and
categories, but it cannot invent financial facts. Its output belongs in clearly
labeled AI analysis or narrative fields, not factual columns posing as sourced
data.

**UDF vs ordinary interaction.** UDFs are for user-registered functions other
viewers can invoke. Tabs, filters, chart controls, and feed-backed refresh do
not require UDFs.

**Trading execution vs analysis.** Backtests and signals use Altra. Actual
orders require the trading surface, a dry run first, explicit user confirmation
before non-dry-run execution, and [api/trading.md](references/api/trading.md).
This per-order confirmation rule holds for any order placed in an ordinary
conversation. *Exemption (channel-loop ticks only):* a channel-loop tick whose
loop `--goal` carries the consent reference line `[auto-trade-consent: granted
<ISO8601-UTC> record=~/memory/auto-trade-consent.md]` AND whose one-read
verification (`alva fs read` of `~/memory/auto-trade-consent.md`) finds the
consent record MAY place live orders without per-order user confirmation. It
stays subject to dry-run validation first, a fresh idempotent intent-id, and
trex risk rules; a missing or unreadable record means NO live orders. This
exemption applies only to loop ticks — never to interactive conversation orders.
The creation-side consent protocol (disclaimer, consent recording, revocation)
lives in the channel profile's "Channel loops" section.

## Capability Map

The map is organized as one shared layer plus two decision trees. **Shared Data
And Execution** is the common substrate: Data Skills, search, BYOD, `alva run`,
jagent runtime, and provenance rules. **Financial Analysis / Ask Question** uses
that layer for sourced chat answers. **Durable Artifacts / Playbook** uses that
layer, then persists or publishes work through feeds, automations, signals,
playbooks, or release flows. Choose the smallest tree that satisfies the verb.

### Shared Data And Execution Layer

This layer is shared by direct answers and durable artifacts. Do not treat data
access or `alva run` as playbook-only. A direct answer may still need Alva Cloud
execution for live fetches, joins, transformations, shape checks, indicators, or
peer comparisons; the difference is that the result stays in chat instead of
becoming a feed, cronjob, signal, or playbook.

#### Data Access: Data Sources

Data Skills are the primary source for structured financial facts: market
identity and listing status, prices, klines, fundamentals, estimates, insider
and senator trades, ownership, options chains and Greeks, macro, on-chain
metrics, exchange flows, prediction markets, news, and indexed Twitter/X. The
mandatory discovery path is `list` -> `summary` -> `endpoint`. Use
`Authorization: Bearer <ARRAYS_JWT>`, not `X-API-Key`.

Whether a requested listing, ADR/ADS, ticker, exchange, or other security form
exists is a time-sensitive fact. Never use training knowledge or model memory
to skip current online verification, even when the remembered answer is
"private", "unlisted", or "no ADR/ticker". A missing or single-source negative
result is not proof of nonexistence; check another current source or report the
status as unverified. For thematic or sector baskets, verify ticker fit with
live company-detail data; do not trust memory.

Source routing:

- Structured US-equity, options, crypto, on-chain, macro, semiconductor spot
  price, prediction-market, and fundamentals data: Data Skills.
- Twitter/X handle history, URL lookup, or full-text over tracked investing
  accounts: Data Skills.
- Global X search beyond Arrays' index, news/web search, non-US finance, or
  off-catalog asset classes: [search.md](references/search.md) /
  `unified_search`.
- Direct latest/realtime price for covered US equities and crypto: intraday
  klines, not daily-level bars or closes.
- Non-US equities (dotted-suffix tickers like `0700.HK`, `000660.KS`): try Data
  Skills non-US daily kline first; fall back to `searchPerplexityFinance` for
  uncovered tickers or intraday/live prices.

#### Data Access: Platform Data

Platform Data is Alva-maintained data and SDK surface that agents can consume
without rebuilding the upstream ingestion. Treat it as a first-party data
product: inspect the current reference and live fields, cite freshness, and do
not copy private runtime internals into user scripts.

#### Data Access: Content Search And BYOD

Content search enriches a real data pipeline; it does not replace one. Use it
for market narratives, source discovery, global X/Grok queries, news, Reddit,
YouTube, podcasts, web search, non-US finance, and off-catalog assets.

Open [search.md](references/search.md) for source-specific usage and gotchas,
and [content-legitimacy.md](references/content-legitimacy.md) before presenting
any sourced financial value.

BYOD is appropriate when the user supplies a source or Alva coverage cannot
answer the task after capability verification. Wire the source into runtime code
or feed logic; do not paste discovered values into HTML or direct answers. Use
[secret-manager.md](references/secret-manager.md) if credentials are needed.

BYOD still has to behave like an Alva source: validate it, state freshness and
blind spots, and route durable outputs through feeds.

#### Execution: Jagent Runtime And `alva run`

Alva runtime scripts execute JavaScript in a sandboxed V8 isolate through
`alva run` or cronjobs. They cannot access local files, shell, Node builtins,
`process`, global `fetch`, top-level `await`, or timer globals.

Open [jagent-runtime.md](references/jagent-runtime.md) before writing runtime
code. Common modules:

| Need                          | Module / reference                                                                                            |

| user id, username, args       | `require("env")`                                                                                              |
| third-party secrets           | `require("secret-manager")`; [secret-manager.md](references/secret-manager.md)                                |
| HTTP                          | `require("net/http")`                                                                                         |
| statistics / indicators       | `@alva/algorithm` or runtime `alva sdk` modules                                                               |
| persistent feed output        | `@alva/feed`; [feed-sdk.md](references/feed-sdk.md)                                                           |

| scheduled LLM reasoning       | `@alva/pi`; [alpi.md](references/alpi.md)                                                                     |
| ONNX model inference          | `@alva/onnx`; [onnx.md](references/onnx.md)                                                                   |
| runtime tests                 | `@test/suite`                                                                                                 |

Runtime code should be boring and inspectable: small shape checks before full
feeds, explicit precondition errors, no silent fallback records, and no local
simulation when the blueprint requires Alva Cloud behavior. If a script throws
`ReferenceError: <X> is not defined`, rewrite for the jagent runtime instead of
retrying the same code. Before each write/run/debug step, read the matching
section in [operational-pitfalls.md](references/operational-pitfalls.md).

#### Provenance: Financial Values

Read [content-legitimacy.md](references/content-legitimacy.md) before surfacing
financial values in either tree. Comparison baselines are financial facts. A
historical average, peer multiple, macro yardstick, or benchmark return that
supports a judgment must be fetched or clearly labeled as unsourced. Do not put
sourced current data next to memory-derived baselines.

### Financial Analysis / Ask Question Tree

Financial analysis is the default for user questions about markets, assets,
portfolios, valuation, catalysts, rankings, comparisons, and "why" narratives.
It may be a single fresh data fetch, an `alva run` computation over live data, a
sourced explanation, a peer comparison, a thesis check, or a concise table. It
is not merely "Data Query": data access and execution are steps inside an
analysis answer.

For broad analysis of a named company, proactively read
[company-anomaly.md](references/company-anomaly.md), then test its exact-ticker
Company Anomaly coverage before answering. When covered, include the current
anomaly state and freshness as one analysis dimension. When unavailable,
continue the ordinary analysis; do not substitute anomaly intelligence for
fundamentals, valuation, or company news.

Common subroutes are latest fact, contextual explanation, comparison/valuation,
ranking or screen-in-text, and thesis check. They all end as an answer unless
the user asks to track, alert, share, publish, or turn the result into an app.

Use the shared data and execution layer first. If the user asks a direct
question, answer directly with provenance; if they ask to track, alert, share,
or publish, route to the durable artifact / playbook tree instead.

Financial-analysis answer gate: before answering any Financial Analysis / Ask
Question, read [user-facing-prose.md](references/user-facing-prose.md), then
satisfy the ask evidence gate. Simple latest-fact asks stop there after one
sourced hop; complex judgment asks must also use the Complex Ask Router in
[request-routing.md](references/request-routing.md), apply every matching
quality gate, and cap confidence when required evidence, KPI coverage, or
computation is missing. Do not answer until you can name the decomposition,
data/source path for each hop, fetched vs missing coverage, and which judgments
are sourced facts, computed values, or inference.

### Durable Artifacts / Playbook Tree

Enter this tree when the user asks Alva to keep something running, reusable,
shareable, inspectable, or actionable. The tree is broader than playbooks: a
script, feed, alert, signal, model output, or trading analysis may be the right
artifact without a hosted UI. Enter the playbook branch only for hosted apps,
share URLs, remixes, annotation edits, release/version updates, or playbook
publication work.

#### Data Product Layer: Feed Lifecycle And Automation

Feeds persist data under ALFS and are the normal backing store for live analysis
products, playbooks, dashboards, signals, alerts, and reusable outputs. A feed
is not automatically a playbook; it can also back an alert, digest, signal,
reusable dataset, or future answer.

Read [alva-knowledge.md](references/alva-knowledge.md) before designing an
automation. Read [feed-lifecycle.md](references/feed-lifecycle.md) and
[feed-sdk.md](references/feed-sdk.md) when creating or changing a feed. The
short creation lifecycle is: write schema and logic to ALFS, `alva run`,
deploy, publish once with `alva automation publish`, then use its returned
`feed_id` with `alva feed set-visibility` when public access is required.
For an existing automation, keep that identity: ALFS source edits are already
live, while registered version, producer, or metadata changes use
`alva automation update --id <feed_id>`. Never delete and recreate merely to
apply an update.

Before automation publish, satisfy `before-automation-publish`: fresh run,
expected shape, fresh evidence, and a known producer cronjob id. After publish,
set public visibility through the feed lifecycle command and verify public,
non-empty data before dependent HTML work. Feed scripts fail fast on missing
data; the detailed publish and visibility contract lives in the feed
references. Read the matching
[operational-pitfalls.md](references/operational-pitfalls.md) section before
each feed, ALFS, deploy, and publish step.

#### Publication Layer: Playbook Creation Tree

Playbooks are hosted investing apps: dashboards, screeners, thesis trackers,
backtest surfaces, what-if studies, event studies, or custom interactive tools.
Enter this branch only when the user wants a hosted/shareable surface, remix,
annotation edit, release/version update, or playbook publication work.

Read [playbook-creation.md](references/playbook-creation.md) before creating or
changing the hosted surface. It owns the build order, Browser-safe feed reads,
README, draft/release gates, screenshot verification, tier/visibility flow, and
push-after-release handoff. Read [api/release.md](references/api/release.md) for
README, tags, trading-symbol, and `--skill-id` details; read
[remix-workflow.md](references/remix-workflow.md) or
[annotation-edits.md](references/annotation-edits.md) for those subroutes.

The top-level boundary is feed-first and live-read: build feeds before HTML, and
visible numbers must be read from feed outputs in the viewer's browser. Before
HTML work, satisfy `before-build-html`; before draft/release satisfy
`before-playbook-draft` and `before-playbook-release` in the reference. Keep
procedure, release, screenshot, and tier details in the owning references.

Subroutes are new build, Skillhub-guided build, remix, annotation/edit,
release/version update, and push after release. Do not let every financial
question inherit playbook gates.

#### Strategy Layer: Altra

Altra is the trading and backtesting engine. Always use Altra for backtesting.
Use it for any strategy, simulation, portfolio logic, signal feed, equity curve,
target record, position tracking, order stream, drawdown, Sharpe, or
rebalancing.

Open [altra-trading.md](references/altra-trading.md) before implementation. It
owns provider setup, feature registration, event triggers, strategy state,
target/signal structure, PIT compliance, testing, debug patterns, and supported
OHLCV intervals.

Stock intraday window guardrail: do not directly request multi-year US stock
intraday backtests as one full window. Narrow the window, use daily/weekly bars,
or choose a provider path that explicitly chunks requests.

#### Reasoning Layer: alpi

alpi embeds a fixed LLM reasoning/tool loop inside a deterministic scheduled
pipeline. Use `@alva/pi` `Agent.ask()` for result-only classification,
summarization, TLDRs, why-it-matters, and tool-loop reasoning over real upstream
data.

Do **not** use it for one-off research the user asks interactively, and do not
use it to produce numbers or events that should come from real data. Read
[alpi.md](references/alpi.md) for API, tool calling, memory patterns,
user-editable agent instructions (release with `--agent-type alpi`, then append
the owner's `AGENTS.md` (read `${feed.path}/AGENTS.md` yourself)), and
jagent-specific constraints.

#### Model Layer: ONNX

Use ONNX when the user supplies or plans to upload an exported `.onnx` model
artifact. Read [onnx.md](references/onnx.md). Predictions must be computed from
real data, written through feed outputs, and rendered from released/granted
paths. Public playbooks should expose feed outputs, not raw model artifacts.

#### Interface Layer: Design System

The design system is a release gate, not decoration. Read
[design.md](references/design.md) first for tokens, typography, theme, layout,
and the canonical stylesheet. Then read:

- [design-widgets.md](references/design-widgets.md) for charts, widget layouts,
  and tables (the authoritative Table Card spec lives here, not in
  design-components.md).
- [design-components.md](references/design-components.md) for buttons, tabs,
  tags, dropdowns, and component details.
- [design-playbook-trading-strategy.md](references/design-playbook-trading-strategy.md)
  for strategy/backtest playbooks.

Runtime artifacts:

- [design-contract.yaml](references/design-contract.yaml) is consumed by
  `alva lint playbook` and `alva release playbook`.
- [css/design-system.css](references/css/design-system.css) is the bundled
  stylesheet; use it, but read `.md` docs for rules.
- [design-tokens.css](references/design-tokens.css) backs the bundle.

Pages using ECharts must satisfy the contract rule requiring
`requestAnimationFrame` around init/resize in hidden or resizable containers.

#### Interface Layer: UDF Runtime

User-Defined Functions let a playbook owner register shareable functions that
viewers can invoke from the playbook UI. This is strict opt-in: only use it when
the user asks for a registerable function or a button that calls their analysis
function.

Open [api/udf-runtime.md](references/api/udf-runtime.md). It owns PBSV browser
authentication, `alva functions` creator registration and allowance tools,
`window.alva.udf`, allowance consent, `UdfButton`, caller identity,
`allow_charges=false` defaults, and release checks.

#### Action Layer: Alerts

Alerts are personal notification opt-ins for automations (feeds). Playbook
follows are independent and never enable or disable alerts. A feed may emit
`signal/targets` or `notify/message`; both dispatch `feed_alert_ready`.
`--push-notify` only marks the publisher capable of alerts. It does not
subscribe users or bypass preferences.

Open [push-notifications.md](references/push-notifications.md) for sidecar creation,
automation publish, alert setup, and verification. Quiet runs use `<|SKIP_NOTIFICATION|>`.

After releasing or keeping a playbook as draft, scan whether any backing feed is
push-worthy. Recommend specific feeds, not generic "notifications". A push setup
is not complete until the feed sidecar exists, `alva automation publish` ran
after that sidecar was added, the publisher has `--push-notify`, and the
intended alert binding is enabled. That proves configuration, not that a
message has already been delivered.

#### Playbook Subroute: Remix

A remix request usually arrives as `<remix ...>`. Extract source owner/name from
the tag URL, read the source feed scripts, HTML, README, and playbook metadata,
then build a new playbook under the requesting user's namespace. If the source
has registered UDFs, preserve them unless the user explicitly asks otherwise.

Open [remix-workflow.md](references/remix-workflow.md). `alva remix` records
parent-child lineage only; use `alva fs read` to read playbook files. If the
user asks to browse examples, use `alva playbooks trending` after help.

#### Playbook Subroute: Annotation Edits

Annotation edits target rendered playbook elements through `<annotation>` tags.
Locate the generator behind the element, usually a render function or CSS rule,
and edit that. Never freeze rendered feed values into static text.

Open [annotation-edits.md](references/annotation-edits.md). HTML edits re-enter
`before-build-html`.

#### Support Layer: Memory

Alva memory is file-based and user-visible: global user understanding lives in
`~/memory/user.md`, while each channel has `~/channels/<slug>/memory/MEMORY.md`
and daily Journal files. Read [memory.md](references/memory.md) before writing.
Never store secrets, raw API keys, automation runtime state, or unverified claims
as truth.

#### Support Layer: Secret Manager

Use [secret-manager.md](references/secret-manager.md) whenever runtime code
needs API keys, exchange credentials, webhook secrets, or other third-party
credentials. Prefer the web upload page at <https://alva.ai/apikey>. Do not ask
the user to paste sensitive third-party secrets into chat when web upload is
feasible. Runtime access and CRUD details live in the reference; never log
returned values.

#### Support Layer: Platform Feedback

When an Alva-owned API/runtime/data/docs/auth/product issue blocks or materially
degrades the task, read [api/feedback.md](references/api/feedback.md), run
`alva feedback --help`, ask for user confirmation, and scrub secrets before
submitting. If the task fails because Alva behaved unexpectedly, offer the
feedback flow before closing.

## Content Legitimacy Quick Rules

Open [content-legitimacy.md](references/content-legitimacy.md) before surfacing
financial values. The quick checks:

- Charts, tables, metric cards, and query answers need real Data Skills, feed,
  or validated BYOD provenance.
- HTML values are fetched from feed outputs at runtime. Never hardcode data as
  inline JavaScript literals for financial values.
- If `alva release playbook --feeds '[]'` is used, the HTML must render zero
  quantitative values.
- WebSearch can discover docs or BYOD endpoints; it cannot become the data.
- LLM/alpi output can synthesize real upstream data; it cannot invent facts,
  figures, events, or sourced-looking reports.
- More than 20% failed symbol lookups is a data-quality blocker, not a prompt to
  fabricate or mark rows `live: false`.
- Feed Scope Isolation: build new feeds unless the user explicitly asks for
  reuse.
- For fundamentals periods, YoY/QoQ, or cross-company comparisons, open
  [fundamentals-periods.md](references/fundamentals-periods.md).
- Descriptions, README, methodology, and copy can only list data sources and
  cadences actually wired and deployed.

## Common Workflows

These sketches are the encyclopedia-level shape of the work. Open the named
reference before doing the task.

### Ask Question / Financial Analysis

For "what is the latest price / P/E / funding rate / holdings / CPI print", "why
did it move", "analyze this company", "is it cheap vs peers", or "rank these in
text", start with financial analysis. For broad named-company analysis, apply
the proactive Company Anomaly check defined in the Financial Analysis tree. Run
preflight if needed, verify the relevant Data Skills or search route, use
`alva run` when live computation or joins are needed, fetch or qualify any
comparison baseline, read
[user-facing-prose.md](references/user-facing-prose.md), apply the answer gate
in the Financial Analysis tree, classify complex asks with
[request-routing.md](references/request-routing.md), and answer with inline
provenance. If a structured source returns stale or missing latest data, use
[data-skills.md](references/data-skills.md#structured-feed-lag) before refusing
when a known official release may be ahead of the feed; otherwise report the
failure instead of substituting a web snippet or model memory. If the user then
asks to track, alert, share, or publish, upgrade the route to a feed, signal,
alert, or playbook.

### Hosted Playbook Workflow

Enter this tree when the user wants a hosted app, share URL, dashboard, screener
app, report surface, remix, annotation edit, or release/version update. First
choose the artifact shape: direct answer,
feed, signal, model output, or hosted playbook. For hosted/shareable surfaces,
turn the request into a data contract before UI work: universe, metrics,
freshness, output groups, widgets, and release path. Then open
[playbook-creation.md](references/playbook-creation.md),
[remix-workflow.md](references/remix-workflow.md),
[annotation-edits.md](references/annotation-edits.md), and
[api/release.md](references/api/release.md); they own the procedure.

### Thesis, Digest, And Monitoring

A thesis tracker combines structured metrics, content search, and alpi narrative
over real upstream data. It may be a direct answer, a scheduled feed, an alert,
or a playbook depending on the requested artifact. Keep the alpi prompt fixed,
keep source records separate from AI analysis, and make push lines match actual
thesis deltas. If the user gives `/use-skill:alva/thesis` or asks to use a named
thesis blueprint, fetch it fresh and let its method drive the build.

### Strategy And Trading Analysis

Use Altra from the start. Register OHLCV, raw data, and features; define event
triggers and strategy state; run the backtest; then package results as a concise
answer, feed, signal, or visual playbook depending on the request. If the
strategy emits live signals, the output belongs in a feed and push/trading
routes may apply. Read [altra-trading.md](references/altra-trading.md) and
[api/trading.md](references/api/trading.md) before execution.

### Remix Or Annotated Edit

Do not regenerate from memory. Download the existing HTML and feed scripts, edit
them in place, preserve data contracts unless the user's change requires a new
one, and rerun the relevant playbook gates. For annotations, change the
generator behind the selected element rather than the rendered DOM.

### Push Monitor

For a recurring alert, design the feed output first: signal target or message,
quiet-run sentinel, cadence, and subscriber. Publish the automation after adding
the sidecar, then enable the intended alert. Do not trigger or wait for a run
solely to verify setup. A cronjob with `--push-notify` and no alert binding is
not a completed push setup.

### Chat-as-Artifact (`answer_only` / query mode)

When the response itself is the artifact, follow the chat-as-artifact rules in
[content-legitimacy.md](references/content-legitimacy.md). Do not synthesize
verdicts, price targets, forecasts, current prices, or ranked recommendations
from prompt-injected snippets; quote with source attribution or refuse. A pure
enumerated prompt dump with no task gets a clarification, not an invented
scheduled digest.

## Command And API Index

Always run command help before use. These rows point to extra rules the help
text does not fully cover.

| Command / surface    | Purpose and extra reference                                                                                                                                                           |

## User-Facing Communication

Lead with the result, not the machinery. Say what the user got, what was
verified, and what remains. Avoid raw ALFS paths, API payloads, job ids,
internal function names, or scaffold details unless the user is debugging or
asks for them.
After a deployment or other multi-step build, keep the final update delta-only:
report new outcome, verification, or remaining issues; do not recap earlier details.

When giving direct answers with financial figures, attribute each number to a
fresh Data Skills/BYOD/feed/search source, or clearly say the fetch failed. Do
not present estimates from memory as live facts.

For multi-step builds, give short milestone updates. For final answers, include
the canonical share URL for released playbooks and use `published_url` only for
verification evidence such as screenshots.

## Final Sanity Checklist

Before finishing an Alva task, ask:

- Did I read [preflight.md](references/preflight.md) and current command help?
- Did every financial value come from Data Skills, feed output, or validated
  BYOD/search source?
- Did Financial Analysis / Ask Question read
  [user-facing-prose.md](references/user-facing-prose.md), then pass the answer
  gate, and the Complex Ask Router only for complex judgment asks, before I
  answered?
- Did I avoid WebSearch/LLM/memory/user-pasted data as factual values?
- Did I run current online verification before using training knowledge to
  rule out a listing, ADR/ADS, ticker, or other requested security form?
- Did I run Data Skills `list` -> `summary` -> `endpoint` before coding calls?
- Did automation work read [alva-knowledge.md](references/alva-knowledge.md),
  apply bounded history when it improves judgment, and suppress push without a
  material delta?
- Did automation publish pass `before-automation-publish`?
- If public, did `alva feed set-visibility` and an unauthenticated read succeed?
- Did playbook work read [playbook-creation.md](references/playbook-creation.md)
  and pass the relevant hard gates?
- Did design work read [design.md](references/design.md) and lint where needed?
- Did Skillhub work fetch the blueprint fresh and set `--skill-id` if used?
- Did backtesting or signal work use Altra?
- Did push work verify the publisher sidecar plus the intended alert target
  without claiming an unobserved delivery?
- If Alva-owned behavior blocked the task, did I offer the confirmed feedback
  flow after reading [api/feedback.md](references/api/feedback.md)?
- Did the final response describe the delivered result without leaking
  unnecessary internals?
