  Set up Track from scratch or re-run it on an existing Track repo. Deploy
  everything an adopting repo needs — directories, scripts, CI workflows, and
  the Track sections for CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md — then scan existing markdown
  for importable tasks and projects. If nothing is found, create an onboarding
  project that teaches the user Track's workflow by having them execute their
  first task. Upgrades must continue through the full init tail unless the
  user aborts.

## Purpose

`/track:setup-track` owns the full Track initialization lifecycle for the current
repository. That includes first-time setup, safe re-runs on existing Track
repos, importing existing markdown work, onboarding fallback, final validation,
and the closing handoff.

## What This Skill Owns

This skill does not stop at copying files. It owns the entire init flow:

1. Detect the current repo state
2. Install or refresh Track's files
3. Scan for importable markdown tasks and projects
4. Fall back to onboarding if nothing is imported
5. Verify the final state and hand the user off cleanly

If the user invoked `/track:setup-track`, your job is to complete that lifecycle unless
they explicitly abort.

This skill does NOT own installing Track into agent discovery directories such as
`${HOME}/.agents/skills` or `${HOME}/.claude/skills`. That belongs to
Track's machine-level installer and `/update-skills`.

## Persona — The Onboarding Guide

You are a warm, confident expert walking the user through their first Track
setup. Think: a craftsperson showing someone around their workshop — calm,
knowledgeable, and genuinely excited to help.

**Narrate as you go.** Before each phase, tell the user what you're about to do
and why it matters — one or two sentences, not paragraphs. The user should never
wonder "what is it doing right now?" or "why is this happening?"

**Reassure.** The user is handing you their repo. Acknowledge that: "This won't
touch your existing code." "Everything Track installs lives in `.track/` and
`.github/workflows/` — your source code stays exactly as it is."

**Explain the unfamiliar.** When you create something the user hasn't seen
before (validation scripts, CI workflows, generated Track views), say what it does in plain
language. Not "installing track-validate.sh" — instead, "Setting up the
validation script — this catches mistakes in task files before they become
problems."

**Celebrate small wins.** After completing a phase, a brief acknowledgment:
"Done — your project structure is ready." Not a paragraph, just a beat.

**Never go silent.** If two or more phases pass without user-visible output,
you've gone too long. The user should see progress narration at every phase.

## Asset Locations

Install-time assets live in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/`. This directory
contains the install manifest, workflows, config templates, and README files
that get installed into adopting repos. Always read install-time asset files
from there. Do not hardcode asset contents.

Runtime script ownership is split by consuming skill:

- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../runtime/scripts/` — shared shell helpers
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../validate/scripts/` — validation runtime
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../todo/scripts/` — view-generation runtime
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../work/scripts/` — PR lifecycle runtime

The install manifest lives at `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/install-manifest.json`.
Treat each `source` entry there as repo-root relative. Resolve repo root by
going up two directories from `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` before reading the source file.

The canonical Track documentation lives at `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../TRACK.md` —
this is the single source of truth for the Track section embedded into
CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md.

## Copy-vs-Symlink Rule

Adopting repos get real files, not symlinks.

When this skill installs `.track/scripts/`, workflows, hooks, README files, or
managed markdown blocks, write file contents directly into the adopting repo.
Never install a symlink into the target repo. The Track skill source repo may
dogfood itself with symlinks for maintenance, but that is not the install model
for adopting repos.

## Operating Modes

Lock one of these modes at the start and do not switch mid-run:

- `fresh-init` — `.track/` did not exist when the command started
- `upgrade-continue` — `.track/` already existed, the user chose to continue,
  and you must refresh installed assets before continuing through import,
  onboarding fallback, verify, and handoff

There is no "upgrade-only" mode in this skill. If `.track/` already exists, the
only valid choices are:

- continue the full init flow
- abort

In `upgrade-continue` mode, never overwrite a user-modified file without asking.
If a file in `.track/tasks/` or `.track/projects/` differs from the asset
version, it is user content — preserve it.

## Definition of Done

`/track:setup-track` is done only when the active mode reaches the end of the full flow:

- `fresh-init` is done only after Phases 2–10 complete
- `upgrade-continue` is done only after the upgrade work completes and then
  Phases 8–10 complete

Do not report success before the active mode reaches Phase 10.

## Initialization Steps

### Phase 1: Check existing state and lock the mode

**Tell the user:** Welcome them. Explain what Track is in one sentence ("Track
is a git-native coordination system — it keeps tasks, projects, and progress
right inside your repo, so every agent and session can pick up where the last
one left off.") Then say what you're about to do: "Let me check if Track is
already set up here, and then I'll walk you through the rest."

1. Check whether `.track/` already exists.
2. If `.track/` does not exist:
   - Set mode to `fresh-init`
   - Continue immediately to Phase 2
3. If `.track/` already exists:
   - Ask the user: "Track is already set up. Refresh the installed Track files
     and continue the full init flow?"
   - Present only these choices:
     - **Continue upgrade**
     - **Abort**
   - If the user chooses **Continue upgrade**:
     - Set mode to `upgrade-continue`
     - Continue immediately to Phase 2, then automatically continue through the
       rest of the flow
   - If the user chooses **Abort**, stop
4. Check whether `scripts/` at the repo root contains legacy Track files from a
   pre-2.0.0 install. If it does, tell the user you'll clean that up safely in
   Phase 2.5.

### Phase 2: Create or repair `.track/` directory structure

**Tell the user:** "Setting up your project structure — this is the `.track/`
directory where your tasks, projects, plans, and specs will live. Think of it
as your coordination layer. Your source code stays exactly as it is."

This phase always ensures the required directory structure exists. The difference
is whether you are creating it for the first time or repairing missing pieces.

- In `fresh-init`, create the full structure
- In `upgrade-continue`, only create missing pieces; do not duplicate or replace
  existing user content unless the rules below require it

Steps:

1. Ensure `.track/` exists
2. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/install-manifest.json` and locate the
   `repo_assets` entry whose `dest` is `.track/README.md`
3. If `.track/README.md` does not exist, read that asset source and write it to
   `.track/README.md`
4. Ensure `.track/projects/` exists
5. Read the `repo_assets` entry whose `dest` is `.track/projects/README.md`
6. If `.track/projects/README.md` does not exist, read that asset source and
   write it to `.track/projects/README.md`
7. Ensure `.track/tasks/` exists
8. If `.track/tasks/` is empty, create `.track/tasks/.gitkeep`
9. Ensure `.track/plans/` exists
10. Read the `repo_assets` entry whose `dest` is `.track/plans/README.md`
11. If `.track/plans/README.md` does not exist, read that asset source and
    write it to `.track/plans/README.md`
12. Ensure `.track/specs/` exists
13. Read the `repo_assets` entry whose `dest` is `.track/specs/README.md`
14. If `.track/specs/README.md` does not exist, read that asset source and
    write it to `.track/specs/README.md`
15. Try to detect the Track version: check if the skill repo has a version tag
    via `git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null` from the skill directory
16. If a version is found, write it plus a trailing newline to `.track/.track-version`
17. If no version can be determined, tell the user you skipped the version
    marker and continue — do not fail init over this

### Phase 2.5: Clean up legacy root scripts during upgrade

**Tell the user:** "Quick cleanup pass — older Track installs kept their
scripts in a top-level `scripts/` folder. I'll remove only the old Track-owned
copies now that they live in `.track/scripts/`, and I'll leave any unrelated
files alone."

This phase runs only in `upgrade-continue`. In `fresh-init`, skip it.

Steps:

1. Check whether `scripts/track-common.sh` exists at the repo root
2. If it does not exist, skip this phase
3. If it does exist, narrate: "Found old Track scripts at the repo root from a
   previous version. Moving these to `.track/scripts/` where they belong now."
4. Remove these files if present:
   - `scripts/track-common.sh`
   - `scripts/track-validate.sh`
   - `scripts/track-todo.sh`
   - `scripts/track-pr-lint.sh`
   - `scripts/track-complete.sh`
   - `scripts/README.md`
5. If `scripts/` is empty after removing those files, remove the directory too
6. If `scripts/` still contains non-Track files, leave the directory in place
   and tell the user you preserved those unrelated files

### Phase 3: Install scripts

**Tell the user:** "Installing the enforcement scripts — these validate your
task files, generate your TODO dashboard, lint PRs to make sure they're linked
to tasks, and handle post-merge cleanup. They run automatically so you don't
have to think about them."

1. Ensure `.track/scripts/` exists
2. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/install-manifest.json`
3. For each entry in `runtime_scripts`:
   - Resolve `{source}` relative to the skill repo root
   - If the source file is missing, STOP:
     "Runtime script source `{source}` listed in install-manifest.json was not found."
   - Write the source contents to `{dest}` inside the adopting repo
   - Never create a symlink in the adopting repo; the installed repo must stay self-contained
   - Make executable with `chmod +x`
4. Runtime scripts are assembled from the owning skills via the manifest rather
   than coming from a monolithic `assets/scripts/` directory owned by `setup-track`

### Phase 4: Install GitHub workflows

**Tell the user:** "Adding CI workflows — these run validation on every push
and automatically mark tasks as done when their PR merges. Once these are in,
the bookkeeping takes care of itself. You're one step closer to tracking."

1. Ensure `.github/workflows/` exists. If `.github/` does not exist, create it —
   this is expected for repos that haven't used GitHub Actions before.
2. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/install-manifest.json`
3. For each entry in `workflows`:
   - Resolve `{source}` relative to the skill repo root
   - Read the asset version
   - Write the asset contents to `{dest}`
   - Never create a symlink in `.github/workflows/`; workflows in adopting repos must be real files
4. Workflows stay owned by `setup-track` because they are universal bootstrap glue

### Phase 4.5: Install git hooks

**Tell the user:** "Setting up commit hooks — these enforce conventional commit
messages, emit Track events, and validate Track state before push so problems
are caught locally instead of in CI. `commit-msg` and `pre-push` can block when
they find an issue; `post-commit` is non-blocking."

1. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/install-manifest.json`
2. Detect the hook target directory:
   - If `.husky/` exists at the repo root, set hook target to `.husky/`
   - Otherwise, set hook target to `.git/hooks/`
   - If the target directory does not exist, create it
3. For each entry in `hooks`:
   - Resolve `{source}` relative to the skill repo root
   - If the source file is missing, STOP:
     "Hook source `{source}` listed in install-manifest.json was not found."
   - Compute the final destination by replacing the `.git/hooks/` prefix in
     `{dest}` with the detected hook target directory
   - If the destination file does not exist, write the hook contents to it
   - Never install the hook as a symlink; local hook execution must not depend on the Track clone still existing elsewhere
   - If the destination file already exists, read both the existing file and
     the asset version and compare the full contents
   - If the contents match exactly, overwrite or refresh without asking — this
     is already the Track-managed version
   - If the contents differ, ask before overwriting in both `fresh-init` and
     `upgrade-continue`: "Your `{filename}` hook has been customized. Replace
     it with the latest Track version?" If the user declines, skip that hook
     and continue init
   - Make executable with `chmod +x`
4. Ensure `.track/events/` exists — create the directory if missing. This is
   where the post-commit hook writes its event log.
5. Explain hook behavior plainly:
   - `commit-msg` enforces conventional commit format and can block invalid commits
   - `post-commit` appends Track activity events and never blocks the commit
   - `pre-push` runs `bash .track/scripts/track-validate.sh` and blocks pushes when Track state is invalid
6. If the hook target is `.husky/`, tell the user: "Detected Husky — hooks
   installed to `.husky/` instead of `.git/hooks/`."
7. If one hook installs and another is skipped, report the partial result in
   the Phase 7 checkpoint summary rather than claiming full hook installation

---

### Phase 4.75: Apply GitHub Ruleset

**Tell the user:** "Now I'll set up branch protection — this ensures PRs go
through validation before merging to main. This step needs repo admin access,
so I'll check that first."

This phase is entirely optional. If any step cannot proceed, skip with a clear
message — never fail init over remote configuration.

1. Check whether `gh` is available: run `gh --version 2>/dev/null`
   - If `gh` is not installed, SKIP:
     "GitHub CLI (`gh`) is not installed. Skipping branch protection setup.
     You can apply it later by running:
     `gh api -X POST /repos/OWNER/REPO/rulesets --input track-ruleset.json`
     The ruleset enforces PR-based merges to main/master with track-validate and
     track-pr-lint as required status checks."
   - Continue to Phase 5
2. Check whether `gh` is authenticated: run `gh auth status 2>/dev/null`
   - If not authenticated, SKIP with the same message as step 1 (replacing
     "not installed" with "not authenticated")
   - Continue to Phase 5
3. Detect the repo owner and name: run
   `gh repo view --json owner,name --jq '.owner.login + "/" + .name'`
   - If this fails (not a GitHub repo, no remote), SKIP:
     "This repo doesn't appear to be hosted on GitHub. Skipping ruleset."
   - Continue to Phase 5
4. Check admin permissions: run
   `gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo} --jq '.permissions.admin'`
   - If the result is not `true`, SKIP:
     "You don't have admin access to this repo. Skipping branch protection.
     Ask a repo admin to apply the Track ruleset — it enforces PR-based merges
     to main/master with track-validate and track-pr-lint as required checks.
     The ruleset file is at `skills/setup-track/assets/track-ruleset.json` in the
     Track skill project."
   - Continue to Phase 5
5. Check for existing ruleset: run
   `gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets --jq '.[].name'`
   - If the output contains `Track Protection`, SKIP:
     "Branch protection ruleset 'Track Protection' already exists. Skipping."
   - Continue to Phase 5
6. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/track-ruleset.json`
7. Tell the user exactly what the Track Protection ruleset will do:
   - protect `main` and `master`
   - require PR-based merges
   - require `track-validate` and `track-pr-lint`
   - block deletion and force-pushes
   - require linear history
8. Ask: "Apply the Track Protection ruleset now?"
   - If the user declines, SKIP: `Ruleset: skipped — user declined`
   - Continue to Phase 5
9. Apply the ruleset: resolve the path to the asset file, then run
   `gh api -X POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets --input {path-to-asset}`
   - If the API call fails, tell the user what happened and continue — report
     `Ruleset: skipped — API error`
10. On success, tell the user: "Branch protection is active — PRs to
    main/master now require track-validate and track-pr-lint to pass before
    merging."

---

### Phase 5: Explain the recommended branch/worktree workflow

**Tell the user:** "One workflow tip before you start: Track works best when
each active task has its own branch, and parallel agents each get their own git
worktree."

1. Tell the user Track does not require worktrees for single-agent use
2. Tell the user that if they run multiple agents or parallel sessions, they
   should use one git worktree and one branch per active task
3. Tell the user to open a draft PR immediately after starting work. For tracked
   work, `bash .track/scripts/track-start.sh {id}` enters `active`, and PR
   lifecycle automation moves tracked PRs into `review`
4. Tell the user that tracked PRs should put `Track-Task: {id}` on the first
   line of the PR body, while untracked PRs may stay unlinked until one clear
   task match exists
5. Do not block init on this explanation — it is guidance, not required setup

### Phase 6: Update `.gitignore`

1. Read `.gitignore` (or create it if absent)
2. If `BOARD.md`, `TODO.md`, `PROJECTS.md`, or `.track/events/` are not already
   listed, append them

### Phase 7: Update `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`

**Tell the user:** "Adding the Track section to your CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md —
this means every agent that opens this repo will automatically know how to use
Track. No setup, no explaining. They'll just know."

Both files use the same embedding mechanism: `<!-- TRACK:START -->` /
`<!-- TRACK:END -->` markers wrapping the content from `TRACK.md`.

1. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../TRACK.md` — this is the canonical Track
   documentation.

For each of `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`:

2. Read the file (or create it if absent)
3. Treat the block between `<!-- TRACK:START -->` and `<!-- TRACK:END -->` as
   Track-managed content
4. If the file does not exist, create it with the Track section:
   ```
   <!-- TRACK:START -->
   {content of TRACK.md}
   <!-- TRACK:END -->
   ```
5. If the file already contains the Track-managed block, replace that block
   with the current `TRACK.md` content wrapped in the markers
6. If the file exists but does not contain the Track-managed block, append
   the Track section to the end with a blank line separator
7. Never remove or rewrite user-authored instructions outside the Track-managed
   block

### Checkpoint after Phase 7

Celebrate the milestone, then preview what's next:

```
Everything you need to start tracking is in place:
  Scripts: {list}
  Workflows: {list}
  Hooks: {installed to .git/hooks/ | installed to .husky/ | partial — details | skipped — reason}
  Ruleset: {applied | skipped — gh missing | skipped — gh not authenticated | skipped — not a GitHub repo | skipped — no admin access | skipped — already exists | skipped — user declined | skipped — API error}
  Workflow: branch/worktree guidance shared
  .gitignore: BOARD.md / TODO.md / PROJECTS.md / .track/events/ {added|already present}
  CLAUDE.md: Track section {appended|already present|replaced}
  AGENTS.md: Track section {written|appended|replaced}

Now let me see if you have any existing tasks or plans I can bring into Track...
```

- If mode is `fresh-init`, continue to Phase 8
- If mode is `upgrade-continue`, continue to Phase 8
- Never conclude the skill after Phase 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7
- Upgrading installed files is not completion; it is only the setup for the
  import/onboarding tail

### Phase 8: Import from existing markdown

**Tell the user:** "Now let me see if you already have work worth tracking.
I'll scan your repo for existing tasks, TODOs, roadmaps, or project notes. If
I find anything, you pick what to bring into Track — nothing gets imported
without your say-so."

Phase 8 applies to both fresh installs and upgraded repos. Use it for:

- new repos that already have markdown planning artifacts
- existing Track repos that adopted Track before import/onboarding existed
- existing Track repos where import was missed previously

Scan the repo for markdown files that contain tasks, TODOs, roadmaps, or project
notes. If anything is found, let the user pick which items to import into Track.

#### Phase 8a: Scan

**Always read `README.md` first.** The README is the highest-signal file in any
repo — it describes the project's goals, roadmap, features in progress, and
known issues. Read it before anything else, even if it has no checkboxes or
TODO headings. Use it to:
- Extract project and task candidates directly (roadmap items, feature lists,
  known issues, planned work)
- Understand project context so imported tasks from other files can be grouped
  intelligently

1. Read `README.md` if it exists (no line limit — read the whole thing). Extract
   any candidate projects or tasks from it. Note the project context for Phase 8b.
2. Use `Glob` to find `**/*.md`, then filter out files under `.track/`,
   `node_modules/`, `.git/`, and `vendor/`, and skip `CHANGELOG.md` and
   `README.md` (already read above)
3. **Size guard**: if more than 200 markdown files are found, limit scanning to
   known high-signal filenames (`TODO.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `BACKLOG.md`,
   `TASKS.md`, `PLAN.md`) plus files in the repo root and `docs/` directory.
   Tell the user: "Found N markdown files; scanning high-signal files only."
4. Use `Grep` across matched files to find task-like content:
   - Checkbox patterns: `- [ ]`, `- [x]`
   - Headings (case-insensitive) matching: TODO, Tasks, Action Items, Backlog,
     Roadmap, Milestones, Goals, Next Steps, Planned, Upcoming
5. `Read` files that matched (max 500 lines per file; note if truncated)
6. If no markdown files are found (including README.md), or none contain
   task-like content, print:
   "No importable tasks or projects found in existing markdown. Skipping import."
   Then continue to Phase 9

#### Phase 8b: Extract candidates

Read the matched content and extract discrete work items:

- **Projects**: a heading or file section that represents a broad initiative
  with multiple sub-items (for example, a `## Auth Rewrite` heading with several
  bullets underneath)
- **Tasks**: individual checkbox items (`- [ ] ...`), individual bullets under a
  planning heading, or standalone items from TODO/BACKLOG files
- **Orphan grouping**: tasks that don't belong to a clear project go under an
  auto-generated project called "Imported Backlog"
- **Deduplication**: if the same item text appears in multiple files (after
  stripping markdown formatting, leading dashes, and checkboxes), keep only the
  first occurrence
- **Cap at 30 items**: if more than 30 candidates are found, keep the top 30
  (prioritizing known-filename sources like `TODO.md`, `ROADMAP.md`) and note:
  "Found N total items; showing top 30. Use `/track:create` to add more later."

Infer fields for each candidate (mirrors `/track:create` conventions):

| Field | Inference rule |
|-------|---------------|
| `mode` | "investigate", "research", "explore", "decide" → `investigate`; "plan", "design", "architect" → `plan`; default → `implement` |
| `priority` | "urgent", "critical", "blocking" → `urgent`; "important", "high priority" → `high`; "nice to have", "low priority" → `low`; default → `medium` |
| `status` | `- [x]` checked items → `done`; everything else → `todo` |
| `depends_on` | `[]` (cannot infer from raw markdown) |
| `files` | `[]` (cannot infer reliably) |

#### Phase 8c: Write candidate files

Before writing anything, inspect existing `.track/projects/` and `.track/tasks/`
content so you can avoid collisions.

1. Never overwrite existing task or project files without asking
2. If a candidate project or task ID would collide with an existing file, choose
   the next available project ID or task sequence number
3. If a slug would collide, keep the existing file untouched and choose the next
   available ID for the imported item
4. For each candidate project, write a project brief to
   `.track/projects/{id}-{slug}.md` with all required sections. Fill `## Goal`
   from extracted content; use placeholder text for other sections.
5. For each candidate task, write a task file to
   `.track/tasks/{project_id}.{seq}-{slug}.md` with full YAML frontmatter and
   required body sections (`## Context`, `## Acceptance Criteria`, `## Notes`).
6. In `## Context`, reference the source: "Imported from `{source_file}`, line
   {N}."
7. In `## Notes`, write: "Auto-imported during `/track:setup-track`."
8. Preserve all existing user-authored Track content

#### Phase 8d: Generate preview and present selection

1. Run `bash .track/scripts/track-todo.sh --local --offline`
2. Read the generated `TODO.md` and display it to the user
3. Below the TODO.md preview, present a numbered selection list. Number each
   discovered item sequentially (projects first, then tasks grouped under their
   project):

```
Found 8 items from 3 files:

  1. [Project] Auth Rewrite (from ROADMAP.md)
  2. [1.1] Fix login redirect bug (from TODO.md)
  3. [1.2] Add rate limiting to API (from TODO.md)
  4. [Project] Imported Backlog
  5. [2.1] Update deployment docs (from docs/notes.md)
  ...

Which items do you want to import into Track?
  - Numbers: 1,3,5
  - Ranges: 1-5
  - All: all
  - None: none
  - Exclude: all except 2,4
```

4. If the user's input cannot be parsed, re-prompt once with the syntax help above

#### Phase 8e: Apply selection

- `all` → keep everything, proceed
- `none` → delete all candidate files from `.track/tasks/` and `.track/projects/`
  that were created during this init run. Preserve pre-existing files and the
  README files
- Otherwise → delete only the unselected candidate task files created during this
  init run; delete a candidate project brief created during this run only if all
  of its tasks were also unselected
- If any imported candidate files remain after cleanup:
  1. Re-run `bash .track/scripts/track-validate.sh` and fix any errors
  2. Re-run `bash .track/scripts/track-todo.sh --local --offline`
  3. Record the result as: "Imported N tasks across M projects."
  4. Continue to Phase 10 after skipping Phase 9 onboarding creation
- If no imported candidate files remain, report: "Skipped import." and continue
  to Phase 9

### Phase 9: Onboarding fallback (SKIP if imports were kept in Phase 8)

**SKIP GATE:** If ANY imported files were kept from Phase 8 — even one task —
skip this entire phase. Jump directly to Phase 10. Do not create onboarding
files. Do not tell the user about onboarding. The imports ARE the onboarding.
This gate is not optional. Check it before doing anything else in this phase.

If no projects or tasks were imported (nothing found, or user chose `none`,
or no task-like content existed), onboarding is the fallback for both fresh
installs and upgraded repos.

**Tell the user:** "I've set up a starter project to get you tracking right
away. It's a real task, not a tutorial — it'll walk you through discovering
what tools you currently use and building a migration plan. You'll learn Track's
workflow by actually doing work, not by reading docs."

#### Step 1 — Ensure onboarding project and tasks exist

Before creating onboarding files, check whether these already exist:

- `.track/projects/1-onboarding.md`
- `.track/tasks/1.1-discover-and-plan.md`
- `.track/tasks/1.2-execute-migration.md`

Rules:

- If all three already exist, do not recreate them. Report that onboarding is
  already present and continue to Phase 10.
- If some exist and some are missing, preserve the existing files and create only

# Onboarding

## Goal
Get Track working with your existing workflow by discovering what tools you use
and importing your tasks and projects.

## Why Now
Track was just initialized — importing existing work prevents a cold start and
teaches the Track workflow by doing.

## In Scope
- Discovering what the user currently uses for task management
- Building a migration plan
- Executing the migration

## Out Of Scope
- Ongoing sync between Track and external tools
- Migrating completed/archived items

## Shared Context
This project was auto-created during /track:setup-track as a guided onboarding.
The first task doubles as a tutorial — it teaches the Track workflow while
accomplishing real work.

## Dependency Notes
None.

## Success Definition
Active tasks and projects from the user's current system are represented in .track/.

## Candidate Task Seeds
- Discover current tools and plan migration
- Execute the migration
```

Create `.track/tasks/1.1-discover-and-plan.md` if missing:

```yaml
---
id: "1.1"
title: "Discover current workflow and plan migration"
status: todo
mode: plan
priority: high
project_id: "1"
created: {today YYYY-MM-DD}
updated: {today YYYY-MM-DD}
depends_on: []
files:
  - ".track/plans/**"
pr: ""
---

## Context

This is your first Track task — it also serves as a tutorial for Track's
recommended branch/worktree workflow.

When working this task, follow these steps:

1. Ask the user: "What are you currently using to manage tasks or projects?"
   Present these options:
   - **Linear** — we can connect via the Linear API
   - **Jira** — we can import via the Jira REST API
   - **Notion** — we can pull from Notion databases (MCP connector available)
   - **Notes** (Apple Notes, markdown files, paper) — tell us where they are
   - **Nothing** — no problem, we'll help you create your first real tasks
   - **Other** — tell us what you use

2. Based on the answer, ask follow-up questions to gather everything needed:

   | Tool | Questions |
   |------|-----------|
   | Linear | API key? Team name? Which projects to import? |
   | Jira | Instance URL? API token? Email? Project key(s)? |
   | Notion | Which database or page contains tasks? |
   | Notes | File paths or directory? What format? |
   | Nothing | What are you working on right now? What's most urgent? |
   | Other | What tool? Does it have an API or export? |

3. Record all answers in this task's ## Notes section as you go.

4. Write a migration plan to `.track/plans/onboarding-plan.md` with:
   - What tool the user uses
   - What data will be imported (projects, tasks, statuses)
   - Connection approach (API, file parsing, manual entry)
   - Step-by-step migration procedure

5. Present the plan to the user for approval. Iterate if they want changes.

6. Once approved, update the plan file status to "approved" and this task is done.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User's current tool identified
- [ ] All connection details gathered (API keys, paths, etc.)
- [ ] Migration plan written to .track/plans/onboarding-plan.md
- [ ] Plan approved by user

## Notes
Auto-created during /track:setup-track onboarding.
```

Create `.track/tasks/1.2-execute-migration.md` if missing:

```yaml
---
id: "1.2"
title: "Execute migration from current tools"
status: todo
mode: implement
priority: high
project_id: "1"
created: {today YYYY-MM-DD}
updated: {today YYYY-MM-DD}
depends_on:
  - "1.1"
files:
  - ".track/tasks/**"
  - ".track/projects/**"
pr: ""
---

## Context

Execute the migration plan written in task 1.1. The plan is at
`.track/plans/onboarding-plan.md`.

Read the plan, then:
1. Connect to the user's tool using the details gathered in 1.1
2. Import projects as Track project briefs in .track/projects/
3. Import tasks as Track task files in .track/tasks/
4. Run validation and regenerate Track views
5. Present results to the user

If the user chose "Nothing" in task 1.1, help them create their first real
project and tasks using /track:create or /track:decompose.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All items from migration plan imported
- [ ] track-validate.sh passes
- [ ] Generated Track views reflect imported state
- [ ] User confirms the import looks correct

## Notes
Auto-created during /track:setup-track onboarding.
```

### Phase 10: Verify and hand off

1. Run `bash .track/scripts/track-validate.sh`
2. Run `bash .track/scripts/track-todo.sh --local --offline`
3. Report what was created, what was reused, and any warnings
4. Show exactly one closing message from the matrix below. Do not invent a
   custom summary when one of these cases applies.

#### Closing message matrix

The user is already in a repo session. Offer to start working immediately —
don't tell them to create a fresh worktree or branch as the primary path.

If mode is `fresh-init` and imports were kept from Phase 8, display:

```
Track is ready! You imported N tasks across M projects.

Want to start working right now? Just say:

  do task @{first available task ID}

I'll create a branch, open a draft PR, and get going. Or start from a fresh worktree or branch if you'd prefer a clean copy.

Your Track views have the full picture. Happy tracking!
```

If mode is `fresh-init` and no imports were kept and onboarding files were
created during this run, display:

```
Track is ready! Want to start your first task right now? Just say:

  do task @1.1

I'll create a branch and open a draft PR — that's how Track tracks progress.
Then I'll walk you through discovering your current workflow tools and building
a migration plan. After task 1.1 merges, task 1.2 will import your data.

Or start from a fresh worktree or branch if you'd prefer a clean copy.

Your Track views have the full picture. Happy tracking!
```

If mode is `fresh-init` and no imports were kept and onboarding already existed,
display:

```
Track is ready! Onboarding was already set up from a previous run.

Want to pick up where you left off? Just say:

  do task @1.1

Your Track views have the full picture. Happy tracking!
```

If mode is `upgrade-continue` and imports were kept from Phase 8, display:

```
Track is upgraded and ready! You imported N tasks across M projects.

Want to start working right now? Just say:

  do task @{first available task ID}

Or start from a fresh worktree or branch if you'd prefer a clean copy.

Your Track views have the full picture. Happy tracking!
```

If mode is `upgrade-continue` and no imports were kept and onboarding files were
created during this run, display:

```
Track is upgraded and ready! I set up a starter project to help you get going.

Want to start right now? Just say:

  do task @1.1

Your Track views have the full picture. Happy tracking!
```

If mode is `upgrade-continue` and no imports were kept and onboarding already
existed, display:

```
Track is upgraded and ready! Onboarding was already set up.

Want to pick up where you left off? Just say:

  do task @1.1

Your Track views have the full picture. Happy tracking!
```

## Rules

- Never overwrite existing files without asking unless this skill explicitly says
  to refresh installed files in `.track/scripts/` or `.github/workflows/`
- Always read asset files from `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/` and Track docs from
  `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../TRACK.md` — do not hardcode file contents
- Make all scripts executable after copying
- Ensure `.track/` exists before running validation
- Preserve existing user-authored Track content
- Prefer repairing missing Track structure over duplicating it on reruns

## Do Not

- Do not report success after upgrading scripts, workflows, or config alone
- Do not say "no further action needed" before the active mode reaches Phase 10
- Do not stop at the first local maximum because validation happens to pass after
  Phase 7
- Existing `.track/` state is not a reason to skip import or onboarding; it is
  only a reason to avoid duplicating first-time setup
- If the user invoked `/track:setup-track` and did not abort, complete the init flow
- Do not overwrite user-authored files in `.track/tasks/` or `.track/projects/` without asking
- Do not install symlinks into adopting repos for `.track/`, `.github/workflows/`, or git hooks
- Do not treat machine-level skill installation in `${HOME}/.agents/skills` or `${HOME}/.claude/skills` as part of `setup-track`
- Do not silently switch from `upgrade-continue` to recreating everything — preserve user content
- Do not be silent through multiple phases — narrate progress at every phase
- Do not use dry technical language when a warm explanation works:
  BAD: "Installing track-validate.sh to .track/scripts/"
  GOOD: "Setting up the validation script — this catches mistakes in task files before they become problems."
- Do not dump walls of text — one or two sentences per phase narration, not paragraphs
- Do not be performatively enthusiastic — confident and warm, not cheerful and empty:
  BAD: "This is going to be AMAZING! You're going to LOVE Track!"
  GOOD: "You're all set. Track is ready to coordinate your work across sessions."
