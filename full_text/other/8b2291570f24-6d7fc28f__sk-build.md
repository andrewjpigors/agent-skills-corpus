Computes execution waves via `sidekick wave-plan` (dependency + file-overlap order), then per wave: dispatches sk-executor sequentially, runs gates FRESH, dispatches sk-spec-reviewer in parallel, commits each verified task atomically in T-NN order, and batches any deviations for one routing pass. Writes sequential; verification parallel.

You orchestrate task-by-task execution of an existing PLAN.md. Validate inputs, check for design drift, run a branch precheck, then compute waves and walk them in dependency order: dispatch `sk-executor` per `[ ]` item, run the verification gate FRESH from main session, dispatch `sk-spec-reviewer`, handle any surfaced deviation via the Q1 routing contract, and commit each verified step atomically.

This slash command runs in the user's main session because Claude Code's runtime forbids subagents from dispatching other subagents (per `.claude/rules/sk-agent-prompts.md` "Where orchestrators must live"). Orchestration shape: validate inputs → drift check (warn-only) → branch precheck → compute waves (`wave-plan`) → loop { re-read PLAN.md → find next wave → dispatch sk-executor per task (sequential) → verification gate FRESH → sk-spec-reviewer (parallel within wave) → handle deviation OR commit atomically → loop } → exit on `all_tasks_complete`.

M3 executes wave-by-wave. A **wave** is a set of tasks whose dependencies are all satisfied by earlier waves (computed by `sidekick wave-plan`). Within a wave, writes are **sequential** (the orchestrator commits one task at a time in T-NN order, so atomic commit attribution stays trivial); the `sk-spec-reviewer` verification fan-out runs in **parallel**, capped by `.sidekick/config.json` `waveSizeCap`. Worktree-parallel *writes* are an M4 concern — the per-wave executor dispatch (Step 5) is deliberately isolated as a **seam** so a worktree-isolated backend can replace it without changing the surrounding loop.

<constraints>

- The orchestrator does not modify source files itself. Source writes happen exclusively through the dispatched `sk-executor`, and only after the verification gate runs FRESH from main session.
- Run the verification gate FRESH from main session (typecheck + lint + tests + `sk-spec-reviewer`). Subagent output is a claim, not a fact (see § 2 — verification gate independence) — never substitute `sk-executor`'s `gate_summary` for the orchestrator's own gate run.
- Classify every surfaced deviation through the `classify-deviation` CLI (`<dispatcher_contracts>` § 1) — the heuristics are deterministic, not a judgment call. On `verdict: "mismatch"`, surface BOTH prompts with a `⚠` note rather than routing to the subagent's claimed type.
- Only the explicit `deviation` field in `sk-executor`'s JSON deliverable triggers deviation routing. Prose, test counts, and file paths are never scanned for implicit deviation signals.
- Writes go to `.sidekick/plans/<slug>/{PLAN.md, RFC.md}` only. PLAN.md tick lands in the same atomic commit as the executor's source changes; RFC.md `## Amendments` append lands when the user picks `amend`. Frozen sections (`## Goals`, `## Decisions`, `## Architecture`) stay byte-equal pre/post.
- Drift check is warn-only — never block on its verdict; surface the warning and continue.

</constraints>

<reasoning>

Externalise key decisions in prose before acting:

- Which task is next: re-read PLAN.md after each commit; pick first `[ ]` in document order (H3 subsections like `### Core` / `### Polish` are organisational, not boundary-marking).
- The deviation route on a surfaced deviation: pipe the executor's `deviation` block to `classify-deviation`; the helper returns `proceed`/`mismatch` + the route. (This is computed, not judged — the externalised reasoning is just which prompt to render.)
- The gate-failure retry decision: first failure → capture context + re-dispatch sk-executor once with the failure context appended; second failure on the same task → hard-stop.
- Whether the user's routing verb (`amend` / `redesign` / `skip` / `decide` / `pause`) is unambiguous; on freeform replies, keyword-match the first verb and treat the rest as the argument; if genuinely ambiguous, ask one clarifying question rather than guessing.

This reasoning is internal scratchwork — it shapes dispatches, parses, and commits but does not appear inside PLAN.md, RFC.md, or commit messages.

</reasoning>

<inputs>

User invokes `/sk-build <slug>`.

| Arg | Required | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `<slug>` | yes | `add-keyboard-shortcuts` — must point to existing `.sidekick/plans/<slug>/{RFC.md, PLAN.md}` |

M1 ships only the positional slug. Flag axes (autonomous mode, parallelisation, commit-skipping) and per-task selection (e.g. jumping to a specific checklist item) are not supported in M1. If a user passes an unrecognised arg, surface a one-line note in the terminal output and continue with the default behaviour.

</inputs>

<hard_stops>

Emit only the structured-error block (no preamble, no progress narration, no sign-off) for any of:

- `error: missing_inputs` — `<slug>` arg absent.
- `error: missing_rfc` — `.sidekick/plans/<slug>/RFC.md` missing or empty.
- `error: missing_plan` — `.sidekick/plans/<slug>/PLAN.md` missing or empty.
- `error: empty_checklist` — PLAN.md has no `## Checklist` section, or the section has zero items.
- `error: all_tasks_complete` — every checklist item is now `[x]`. Informational; not a failure. Use the success-exit shape below.
- `error: ambiguous_git_state` — the `branch-precheck` CLI verdict is `hard_stop`. Surface the helper's `hard_stop_message` verbatim. Reachable reasons for `--operation build`: `mid_rebase`, `mid_merge`, `mid_cherry-pick`, `mid_bisect`, `detached_head`, `diverged_from_remote`, `cannot_determine_default_branch`.
- `error: gate_failed_twice` — the verification gate failed on the same task across two `sk-executor` dispatches.
- `error: subagent_failed` — `sk-executor` or `sk-spec-reviewer`'s deliverable is malformed (missing required keys, JSON parse failure, missing `deviation` block when `status === "deviation"`, or `deviation` block present but incomplete — any of `type` / `description` / `d_nn_affected` / `goal_change` missing or wrong type).
- `error: invalid_plan_graph` — `wave-plan` returned `dep_cycle` / `dangling_dep` / `no_tasks`. Surface the helper's `reason`.

Hard-stop format:

```
/sk-build halted.

error: <code>
Reason: <one-line description>
```

`all_tasks_complete` success-exit shape:

```
/sk-build complete.

error: all_tasks_complete
Reason: All [ ] items in .sidekick/plans/<slug>/PLAN.md ## Checklist are now [x].
```

User-declined `confirm_action` clean-exit shape (Step 3; not an error):

```
/sk-build cancelled.

Reason: User declined to proceed on default branch.
```

Hard-stops emit only the canonical block — no earlier progress narration, no later sign-off.

</hard_stops>

<workflow>

The orchestration loops over PLAN.md tasks until all checklist items are `[x]`. The loop body has 8 steps (plus Step 8b for wave checkpointing); deviations are batched per wave and resolved in Step 7 before any wave-advance.

### Step 1 — Validate inputs

Confirm `<slug>` is present. Confirm `.sidekick/plans/<slug>/RFC.md` exists and is non-empty. Confirm `.sidekick/plans/<slug>/PLAN.md` exists and contains a `## Checklist` section with at least one `[ ]` or `[x]` item. Hard-stop with the appropriate `error:` code if any check fails.

**Recovery (missing/stale state).** If `.sidekick/state/<slug>/build.json` is absent or its `waves` disagree with a fresh `wave-plan` run, reconstruct from authority before executing: derive the done-set from PLAN.md `[x]` checkboxes, cross-checked against `[T-NN]` scopes in `git log --grep` on the current branch. On disagreement, **git wins** and the discrepancy is surfaced. Then show the user: `reconstructed: <N>/<M> tasks done, resuming at wave <K>; <P> uncommitted changes in working tree` and **wait for confirmation** before proceeding. Uncommitted working-tree changes from an interrupted wave are not trusted (unverified by definition) — surface them (`git status --short`); the user decides keep/discard. Only after confirmation, rebuild `build.json` and continue at the first incomplete wave.

### Step 2 — Drift check (warn-only)

Run the drift CLI via Bash:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/sidekick/bin/sidekick" check-drift <slug>
```

The CLI writes a JSON object to stdout with shape `{ verdict, slug, expected_hash?, actual_hash?, rfc_line_count_at_pin?, reason? }`.

Branch on `verdict`:

- `pinned` — RFC.md hash matches PLAN.md's pin. Continue silently.
- `drifted` — RFC.md changed since PLAN.md was pinned. Surface a one-line warning naming the file and the suggested `git log <expected_hash>..HEAD -- .sidekick/plans/<slug>/RFC.md` command for inspecting what changed. Continue.
- `malformed_pin` — PLAN.md has no `pins-rfc:` frontmatter. Continue silently (legacy or pre-convention plans are not blocked by drift).

If the CLI exits non-zero, or stdout cannot be parsed as JSON, or the `verdict` is anything else, surface a one-line warning that the drift check could not be run, and continue. Drift is informational — never halt on its verdict. (Note: verdicts `missing_rfc` and `missing_plan` are CLI-side checks for absent files; Step 1's existence check should have ruled them out. If they appear here it indicates a race or filesystem inconsistency — treat as the warn-and-continue case.)

### Step 3 — Branch precheck

Run the `branch-precheck` CLI:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/sidekick/bin/sidekick" branch-precheck --operation build --ticket-id <slug>
```

Parse the JSON object on stdout (the `--ticket-id` is optional). The helper can return these verdicts:

- `verdict: proceed` — continue silently.
- `verdict: confirm_action` — the helper is asking the user to confirm before proceeding. Surface the helper's advisory text (or a short summary including the `reason`) and ask the user whether to proceed. Reachable reason for `--operation build`: `on_default_for_build` (the user invoked `/sk-build` while on the default branch). If the user confirms, continue. If the user declines, emit the user-declined clean-exit shape (see `<hard_stops>`) and stop — this is a normal cancellation, not an error.
- `verdict: propose_branch` — unreachable for `--operation build` per the helper's policy. If somehow surfaced, treat it as a malformed precheck result and emit `error: ambiguous_git_state`.
- `verdict: hard_stop` — emit `error: ambiguous_git_state` and halt; surface the helper's `hard_stop_message` verbatim. Reachable reasons for `--operation build`: `mid_rebase`, `mid_merge`, `mid_cherry-pick`, `mid_bisect`, `detached_head`, `diverged_from_remote`, `cannot_determine_default_branch`. If the CLI exits non-zero or stdout is unparseable, emit `error: ambiguous_git_state` with the `error`/stderr text.

### Step 4 — Compute waves, find the next incomplete wave

Run `"${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/sidekick/bin/sidekick" wave-plan <slug> --format=json` and parse the JSON. On `verdict: "planned"`, you get `waves` (an ordered array of `T-NN` arrays) — this is the single source of truth for execution order; do not infer order from document order. On `verdict: "dep_cycle"` / `"dangling_dep"` / `"no_tasks"`, hard-stop with `error: invalid_plan_graph` (surface the helper's `reason`). On `missing_plan`, hard-stop `error: missing_plan`.

Re-read `.sidekick/plans/<slug>/PLAN.md` for the current `[x]` state. The **next wave** is the first wave (in order) that contains at least one `[ ]` task. Tasks in that wave already `[x]` are skipped (already built). If every task in every wave is `[x]`, emit the `all_tasks_complete` clean-exit block.

`wave-plan`'s `warnings` (e.g. file-overlap serialization) are surfaced once, on the first wave computation, as a one-line note.

### Step 5 — Execute the wave (executor dispatch seam)

For each `[ ]` task in the current wave, **in T-NN order, one at a time** (sequential writes — M3): dispatch `subagent_type: sk-executor` with the input fields from `<dispatcher_contracts>` § 3 (`task_id`, `task_description`, `files_changed` parsed from the task's `**Files:**` bullets, `goal_ids`, `decision_ids`, `rfc_path`, `gate_commands` from `.sidekick/config.json`). After each executor returns, run the verification gate FRESH for that task (Step 6) before dispatching the next task's executor.

> **Seam (M4):** this sequential per-task dispatch is the single point a worktree-isolated parallel backend replaces. Everything downstream (gate, commit, deviation batching) consumes the same per-task executor deliverables regardless of how they were produced. Do not couple commit/deviation logic to sequential ordering beyond "commit clean tasks in T-NN order."

**Verification fan-out (parallel).** The `sk-spec-reviewer` dispatches for the wave's tasks MAY run in parallel — dispatch up to `waveSizeCap` (`.sidekick/config.json`, default 4) `sk-spec-reviewer` `Agent` calls in one message, then collect. (Typecheck/lint/test gates run per task via Bash as today.) This is the only parallelism in M3.

### Step 6 — Verification gate FRESH

The gate runs from main session via direct Bash invocations and a parallel `sk-spec-reviewer` dispatch. `sk-executor`'s `gate_summary` is a claim; the FRESH run is the source of truth (see `<dispatcher_contracts>` § 2 — verification gate independence).

| Tier | Gate | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Typecheck | `pnpm typecheck` (override via `.sidekick/config.json gates.typecheck`) |
| 1 | Lint | `pnpm lint` (override via `.sidekick/config.json gates.lint`) |
| 1 | Tests | `pnpm test <changed-files-glob>` (override via `.sidekick/config.json gates.test`) |
| 2 | Spec-reviewer | `sk-spec-reviewer` subagent dispatch |

**Tests-tier soft-pass.** If `sk-executor`'s `gate_summary.tests.result === "no_tests_in_scope"` (no `*.test.*` path in `files_changed` AND no sibling test file on disk for any non-test path in `files_changed`), the orchestrator soft-passes the tests tier — no `pnpm test` invocation; emit `(no tests in scope for T-NN)` to the gate-context output. Typecheck, lint, and spec-reviewer run regardless.

**Spec-reviewer dispatch.** Pass `task_id`, `task_description`, `diff` (e.g., the staged diff produced by `git diff --staged` after Step 5's writes, or a `diff_command` for the reviewer to run), `goal_ids`, `decision_ids`, `rfc_path`. Parse the trailing ```json``` fence for the `verdict` field.

**Gate failure handling:**

- First failure on this task (any tier-1 stderr exit, or `sk-spec-reviewer` `verdict: "fail"`, or `sk-executor` `status: "failed"`): capture the failing tier's stderr or the reviewer's `reasoning` verbatim; re-dispatch `sk-executor` once with the failure context appended to the prompt body.
- Second failure on the same task: emit `error: gate_failed_twice` and halt; surface the failing gate output to the user.

`sk-executor`'s internal 3-attempt fix budget restarts on each fresh dispatch; the orchestrator's own retry budget is 1.

### Step 7 — Resolve the wave (commit clean tasks, batch deviations)

A wave runs to completion before resolving deviations — its tasks are dependency-independent, so a deviation in one never blocks its siblings.

1. **Commit clean tasks.** For each wave task whose executor returned `status: "passed"` AND whose FRESH gate passed (Step 6), commit it atomically in **T-NN order** (Step 8) — staging the executor's `files_changed` + the PLAN.md `[ ]`→`[x]` tick for that task **in the same commit**.
2. **Collect deviations.** Gather every wave task with `status: "deviation"` (or a twice-failed gate routed as a deviation) into one batch. For each, validate Q1 heuristics (`<dispatcher_contracts>` § 1) and record the routing context to `.sidekick/state/<slug>/build.json` (the build-state cache — see `<build_state>`).
3. **Surface the batch.** If the batch is non-empty, render each deviation's routing prompt (`<routing_prompts>`) under a single heading `Wave N — M deviation(s) to route`, in T-NN order. Pause for the user.
4. **Apply each routing verb** (`amend` / `redesign` / `skip` / `decide` / `pause`) as defined in `<routing_prompts>`. `redesign`/`decide`/`pause` exit cleanly (the wave's clean tasks are already committed in step 1). `amend`/`skip` commit and continue.
5. **Advance.** Once the batch is resolved (and no exit-verb fired), loop to Step 4 to recompute the next incomplete wave. A task routed `redesign`/`pause` leaves its downstream dependents `[ ]`; they surface naturally on the next wave computation.

The verb actions themselves (`amend` appends an A-NN block to RFC.md + commits; `skip` ticks + commits; `redesign`/`decide`/`pause` exit cleanly with the rerun hint / `git status --short`) are unchanged — see `<routing_prompts>` and `<output_artifacts>`.

### Step 8 — Atomic commit (no deviation, gate passed)

Stage `sk-executor`'s `files_changed` + the PLAN.md tick (`[ ]` → `[x]` on the executed T-NN). Commit atomically with Conventional Commits format:

```
<scope>(<area>): <one-line summary> [T-NN]

<body, optional>
```

`<scope>` ∈ `feat` / `fix` / `refactor` / `tooling` / `docs`. `<area>` reflects the subsystem touched (e.g. `lib`, `auth`, `editor`). Pull `<one-line summary>` from the task description's verb-and-object phrase.

After commit, print terminal feedback `✓ T-NN — committed <sha>` and loop to Step 4.

### Step 8b — Wave checkpoint (governed by `buildCheckpoints`)

After a wave's clean tasks are committed and any deviations resolved, behavior depends on `.sidekick/config.json` `buildCheckpoints` (default `deviations-only`):

- `deviations-only` — **narrate and continue**: print `wave N done: committed T-03, T-04; next: wave N+1 (T-05, T-06)` and loop to Step 4 without pausing. (Deviations already paused in Step 7.)
- `per-wave` — narrate, then **pause** for the user's OK before computing the next wave (`continue` / `inspect` / `abort`).
- `autonomous` — narrate only on errors; loop without pausing on clean waves.

The narration line is also written to `build.json`'s `next_action` (see `<build_state>`).

</workflow>

<dispatcher_contracts>

Four load-bearing contracts the orchestration depends on. Each describes the parse semantics for one subagent or one independent verification step.

### 1. Deviation classification reconciliation (Q1 contract)

**Why it exists.** `sk-executor`'s self-classification is the spec, but trusting one party's classification papers over real disagreement. Surface signaled disagreement explicitly rather than silently routing.

**The classification is deterministic — compute it, don't judge it.** Pipe the executor's `deviation` block to the CLI:

```bash
echo '<deviation-json>' | "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/sidekick/bin/sidekick" classify-deviation
```

It returns `{ verdict, route, signal }`. `verdict: "proceed"` → render the prompt for `route` (`amendment` → amendment prompt; `redesign` → redesign prompt; `decision` → `/sk-decide` suggestion). `verdict: "mismatch"` (the executor claimed `amendment` but the signal — ≥2 D-NN affected, or `goal_change`, or a >150-word description — warrants a redesign) → render the `⚠` note above BOTH prompts. The thresholds live in the helper, not here.

**Mismatch surface form** (prepended above the amendment prompt):

```
⚠ Subagent classified as amendment, but <N> D-NN affected (<list>).
   This typically warrants a redesign loop — see redesign prompt below.

[amendment prompt rendered here]

[redesign prompt rendered here]
```

User reads both, picks any verb. The concrete user verbs (`amend`, `redesign`, `skip`, `decide`, `pause`) are unchanged on mismatch; the orchestrator routes the chosen verb to the matching action.

### 2. Verification gate independence (the subagent-output-is-a-claim contract)

**Why it exists.** Subagent output is a claim, not a fact. Subagents can fail silently in many ways: token-limit truncation, "claimed done but file missing", network errors, hangs. The orchestrator's job is independent verification.

**Steps after subagent return:**

1. Parse the deliverable JSON. If malformed, hard-stop with `error: subagent_failed`.
2. Run `pnpm typecheck` (or `.sidekick/config.json gates.typecheck`) via Bash. Capture stderr on failure.
3. Run `pnpm lint` (or `.sidekick/config.json gates.lint`) via Bash. Capture stderr on failure.
4. Run `pnpm test <changed-files-glob>` (or `.sidekick/config.json gates.test`) via Bash unless the tests-tier soft-pass predicate fires. Capture stderr on failure.
5. Dispatch `sk-spec-reviewer`. Capture `reasoning` if `verdict === "fail"`.
6. If any tier fails: capture failure context, re-dispatch `sk-executor` ONCE with the failure context appended to the prompt body. The orchestrator runs the gate FRESH again on the next return.
7. If the second dispatch fails on the same task: emit `error: gate_failed_twice` and halt.

The orchestrator runs the gate from scratch regardless of what the deliverable claims. `status: "passed"` is informational, not a substitute for the gate.

**Worked example.**

Subagent return: `{ "status": "passed", "files_changed": ["src/lib/foo.ts"], "notes": "tests pass locally" }`.

Internal reasoning (not emitted): subagent claims pass, but the verification-gate-independence contract says verify independently. Run `pnpm typecheck` → exit code 1, stderr names a `TS2322` mismatch in `src/lib/foo.ts`. Tier-1 gate failed; capture context; re-dispatch `sk-executor` with the failure context. If the second attempt also fails, hard-stop with `error: gate_failed_twice`.

### 3. sk-executor dispatch

**Input fields** (passed in the prompt body, YAML-ish):

| Field | Required | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `task_id` | yes | Picked PLAN.md item | e.g. `T-04` |
| `task_description` | yes | Verbatim from PLAN.md | Source of truth for intent |
| `files_changed` | yes | PLAN.md per-task `**Files:**` bullets | Bounds the writable scope; out-of-scope edits surface via deviation |
| `goal_ids` | optional | `[g_n, ...]` annotation prefix | Context only |
| `decision_ids` | optional | `[D-NN, ...]` annotation prefix | Context only |
| `rfc_path` | optional | `.sidekick/plans/<slug>/RFC.md` | For resolving cited IDs |
| `gate_commands` | optional | `.sidekick/config.json gates.*` | Override defaults only when config specifies |

**Deliverable shape** (ONE JSON object inside a final ```json``` fence):

```json
{
  "status": "passed" | "deviation" | "failed",
  "files_changed": ["..."],
  "gate_summary": {
    "typecheck": { "result": "pass" | "fail", "output": "..." },
    "lint":      { "result": "pass" | "fail", "output": "..." },
    "tests":     { "result": "pass" | "fail" | "no_tests_in_scope", "output": "..." }
  },
  "fix_attempts": 0,
  "deviation": {
    "type": "amendment" | "redesign" | "decision_opportunity",
    "description": "...",
    "d_nn_affected": ["D-NN"],
    "goal_change": false
  },
  "notes": "..."
}
```

`deviation` is present iff `status === "deviation"` and absent otherwise. `notes` is optional. `fix_attempts` is an integer in `[0, 3]`.

**Parse semantics:**

- `status === "passed"` → proceed to Step 6 (gate FRESH). `gate_summary` is informational.
- `status === "deviation"` → branch to Step 7. Parse `deviation`; validate Q1 heuristics per § 1.
- `status === "failed"` → `sk-executor` exhausted its 3-attempt internal fix budget. Treat as the orchestrator's first gate failure: re-dispatch once with the failing tier's `output` appended as context. On second failure: `error: gate_failed_twice`.

**Diagnostic fields:**

- `gate_summary.tests.result === "no_tests_in_scope"` informs the orchestrator's tests-tier soft-pass (Step 6).
- `fix_attempts > 0` is diagnostic context useful for reading commit logs later.

### 4. sk-spec-reviewer dispatch

**Input fields** (passed in the prompt body, YAML-ish):

| Field | Required | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `task_id` | yes | Same as Executor | Citation in `reasoning` |
| `task_description` | yes | Verbatim from PLAN.md | Source of truth for intent |
| `diff` | yes | Inline OR `diff_command` | The staged diff after Step 5 writes |
| `goal_ids` | optional | Same as Executor | Cross-reference into RFC.md |
| `decision_ids` | optional | Same as Executor | Cross-reference into RFC.md |
| `rfc_path` | optional | Same as Executor | For resolving cited IDs |

The reviewer receives the task description (spec) and the `diff` read fresh from git (artifact) — never `sk-executor`'s `notes`, `gate_summary`, or deliverable. That seal keeps the verification independent of the producer (Rule 5); the executor's output flows the *other* way (its `reasoning` feeds a re-dispatch on failure), never into the reviewer's input. Preserve this on any future edit.

**Deliverable shape:**

```json
{ "verdict": "pass" | "fail", "reasoning": "..." }
```

inside a final ```json``` fence. `reasoning` is a non-empty string ≤200 words.

**Parse semantics:**

- `verdict === "pass"` → continue to Step 8 (atomic commit). The orchestrator does not regex over `reasoning`.
- `verdict === "fail"` → treat as a verification-gate failure. Capture `reasoning` verbatim into the failure-context block fed to `sk-executor` on the orchestrator's retry.

`sk-spec-reviewer` does not re-run typecheck/lint/tests (those passed before the dispatch) and does not goal-verify (a separate concern). Its scope is diff-vs-task-description only.

</dispatcher_contracts>

<build_state>

`/sk-build` maintains `.sidekick/state/<slug>/build.json` — a **gitignored, per-developer cache** of build progress. It is NOT authority: it is fully reconstructable from PLAN.md `[x]` checkboxes + `[T-NN]` git commit scopes (see Recovery in Step 1). Create `.sidekick/state/<slug>/` if absent. `.sidekick/state/` (and `.sidekick/cache/`) are already gitignored by `sidekick init` — if the entries are somehow missing (the repo was never initialised), surface a one-line note suggesting `"${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/sidekick/bin/sidekick" init` rather than editing `.gitignore` mid-build.

Shape:

```json
{
  "slug": "<slug>",
  "waves": [["T-01"], ["T-02", "T-03"]],
  "current_wave": 1,
  "tasks": { "T-01": "done", "T-02": "pending", "T-03": "deviation" },
  "deviations": [
    { "task": "T-03", "type": "amendment", "routed": "pending", "summary": "..." }
  ],
  "next_action": "wave 2: T-02, T-03"
}
```

Write it after each wave resolution (Step 7 / Step 8b). `tasks` values: `pending` | `done` | `deviation` | `skipped`. Treat write failures as non-fatal (warn and continue — it is a cache, not authority).

</build_state>

<routing_prompts>

Rendered prompts shown to the user when `sk-executor` returns `status: "deviation"`. Pre-fill template fields from the deviation block + invocation context.

### Amendment prompt

Rendered when heuristics validate cleanly to `amendment` (1 D-NN + `goal_change === false` + description ≤150 words). Pre-fill `<T-NN>` from the executed task; pre-fill the body fields from the subagent's `description`.

```
/sk-build paused at <T-NN>.

Implementation introduces a deviation from RFC.md:

  Design said:  <quote or summary of original design intent>
  Discovered:   <what was actually found>
  Proposed:     <what to do about it>

Classify:
  /sk-build amend "<rationale>"   → append A-NN to RFC.md, continue
  /sk-design <slug>               → loop back, redesign approach
  /sk-build skip                  → continue without recording
  /sk-decide <topic>              → record as system rule first
  /sk-build pause                 → halt for thinking
```

### Redesign prompt

Rendered when heuristics validate to `redesign` (subagent said `redesign`, OR mismatch flagged). Pre-fill `<D-NN(s) affected>` from `d_nn_affected[]`; populate `Options surfaced:` from the subagent's options if surfaced (otherwise emit a placeholder `(a) <option from description>`); the `Recommended:` line is `/sk-design <slug>` with the invocation slug. After the redesign lands, the user re-invokes `/sk-build <slug>` to resume.

```
/sk-build paused at <T-NN>.

Implementation hit a structural blocker:

  Design said:  <original D-NN(s) affected>
  Discovered:   <what was actually found>
  Impact:       <N locked decisions affected; approach restructure required>

Options surfaced:
  (a) <option 1 + tradeoffs>
  (b) <option 2 + tradeoffs>
  (c) <option 3 + tradeoffs>

This is bigger than an amendment.

Classify:
  /sk-build amend       → not appropriate (multiple D's affected)
  /sk-design <slug>     → loop back, redesign approach (RECOMMENDED)
  /sk-build skip        → not safe (tests will fail)
  /sk-build pause       → halt for thinking

After /sk-design <slug> completes, re-invoke /sk-build <slug> to resume
through the revised tasks.
```

The `Recommended:` line is concrete and ready to paste — the user copies-and-runs it in their next message. Slash commands cannot dispatch other slash commands.

### Verb-routing keyword match

Users may type the verb in slightly varied form (`amend "X"` / `/sk-build amend "X"` / `amend X`). Match the verb by the first keyword (`amend` / `redesign` / `skip` / `decide` / `pause`); the rest of the line is treated as the rationale or topic argument. If the verb is genuinely ambiguous, ask one clarifying question rather than guessing.

```

### Commit shape (default)

```
<scope>(<area>): <one-line summary> [T-NN]

<One-line phase summary.>

What ships:
- <bullet>
- <bullet>

Spec changes:
- <bullet>

Tests:
- <bullet>
```

**Commit body convention.** Multi-file or multi-concern commits use structured groups + bullets for scannability. Group names are situational (`What ships`, `Spec changes`, `Decisions locked`, `Tests`, etc.); choose what fits the change. Trivial single-file commits may use a one-line body.

Examples:

- `feat(lib): add formatTaskId helper [T-01]`
- `fix(cache): handle empty advancedRule in compiled-rule lookup [T-12]`
- `refactor(lib): extract format helpers into shared module [T-02]`
- `tooling(skills): add /sk-build orchestrator [T-03]`

**Worked example — soft-pass `Tests:` line.** When the Step 6 tests-tier soft-pass fires (`sk-executor`'s tests-in-scope predicate yielded `no_tests_in_scope`), the commit body gains a `Tests:` group line so the soft-pass is visible in the log without digging into the diff. The line renders only when soft-pass fired. Example body for a source-only T-NN that didn't ship tests in scope:

```
feat(lib): add formatTaskId helper [T-01]

Add a small helper for rendering task IDs.

What ships:
- src/lib/format-task-id.ts

Tests: no tests in scope for T-01
```

### A-NN block (rendered only when user picks `amend`)

Append to RFC.md `## Amendments`. If the section doesn't exist, create it after `## Decisions` (or at end of doc if `## Decisions` is absent).

```markdown
## Amendments

### A-NN (T-MM, YYYY-MM-DD)

**Affected:** D-XX[, D-YY...]

**Rationale:** <user-supplied rationale from the amend verb argument>

**Description:** <subagent's deviation.description verbatim>
```

`A-NN` increments per amendment within the ticket's RFC.md (A-01 first, then A-02). `T-MM` references the executing task. Date is ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` from system clock.

### What is NOT auto-edited

Frozen sections — `## Goals & non-goals`, `## Architecture`, `## Decisions`, `## Research notes` — are not auto-edited by `/sk-build`. If the amendment requires re-wording an existing decision, that is a user action — the user edits RFC.md manually, then continues `/sk-build`. Auto-editing frozen sections corrupts the design narrative.

</output_artifacts>

<examples>

Three worked examples: a happy path, a redesign-with-mismatch, and a mixed wave (clean task + amendment).

### Example 1 — Happy path with 3 tasks, all pass

User invokes `/sk-build add-format-helpers`. PLAN.md has 3 tasks (T-01, T-02, T-03) implementing a small `format-task-id` utility module.

Internal reasoning (not emitted): inputs validate; drift check returns `pinned` (silent); the `branch-precheck` CLI returns `proceed`; PLAN.md re-read shows T-01 as next. Dispatch `sk-executor` for T-01. Executor returns `{ status: "passed", files_changed: ["src/lib/format-task-id.ts", "src/lib/format-task-id.test.ts"], gate_summary: { ... all pass ... }, fix_attempts: 0 }`. No `deviation` field — proceed to gate FRESH.

Run typecheck → pass. Run lint → pass. Run tests on the changed files → pass. Dispatch `sk-spec-reviewer` → `{ verdict: "pass", reasoning: "Diff adds formatTaskId(n) at the named path; implementation matches T-01's intent." }`. Stage `files_changed` + PLAN.md tick. Commit: `feat(lib): add formatTaskId helper [T-01]`. Print `✓ T-01 — committed <sha>`. Loop.

T-02 and T-03 follow the same pattern. After T-03's commit, PLAN.md re-read shows all `[x]`. Emit the `all_tasks_complete` clean-exit block.

Output: 3 atomic commits + clean exit. No routing prompts fired.

### Example 2 — Redesign suggested, mismatch flagged, user pauses

User invokes `/sk-build rework-iso-dates`. T-01 dispatched. Executor returns:

```json
{
  "status": "deviation",
  "files_changed": [],
  "deviation": {
    "type": "amendment",
    "description": "Implementing pure ISO 8601 formatting requires re-implementing leap-year, month-length, and zero-padding logic across multiple modules. Three locked decisions (D-01, D-02, D-04) all hinge on the assumption that the platform's date library is available; reverting that assumption changes which modules own which behaviour and what the input contract for recordEvent() looks like.",
    "d_nn_affected": ["D-01", "D-02", "D-04"],
    "goal_change": true
  },
  "gate_summary": { "typecheck": { "result": "fail", "output": "<truncated>" }, "lint": { "result": "pass", "output": "" }, "tests": { "result": "no_tests_in_scope", "output": "" } },
  "fix_attempts": 0
}
```

Internal reasoning (not emitted): pipe T-01's `deviation` block to `classify-deviation` → `verdict: "mismatch"` (claimed amendment, but 3 D-NN affected and `goal_change`). Surface the `⚠` note and render BOTH prompts.

Output (rendered to user):

```
⚠ Subagent classified as amendment, but 3 D-NN affected (D-01, D-02, D-04).
   This typically warrants a redesign loop — see redesign prompt below.

/sk-build paused at T-01.

Implementation introduces a deviation from RFC.md:

  Design said:  D-01, D-02, D-04 — date formatting via platform library
  Discovered:   Pure ISO 8601 implementation crosses module boundaries
  Proposed:     Re-implement leap-year + month-length + padding from scratch

Classify:
  /sk-build amend "<rationale>"   → append A-NN to RFC.md, continue
  /sk-design rework-iso-dates     → loop back, redesign approach
  /sk-build skip                  → continue without recording
  /sk-decide <topic>              → record as system rule first
  /sk-build pause                 → halt for thinking

/sk-build paused at T-01.

Implementation hit a structural blocker:

  Design said:  D-01, D-02, D-04 — date formatting via platform library
  Discovered:   Pure ISO 8601 implementation crosses module boundaries
  Impact:       3 locked decisions affected; approach restructure required

Options surfaced:
  (a) <option from description>

This is bigger than an amendment.

Classify:
  /sk-build amend             → not appropriate (multiple D's affected)
  /sk-design rework-iso-dates → loop back, redesign approach (RECOMMENDED)
  /sk-build skip              → not safe (tests will fail)
  /sk-build pause             → halt for thinking

After /sk-design rework-iso-dates completes, re-invoke /sk-build rework-iso-dates to resume
through the revised tasks.
```

User responds: `/sk-build pause`.

Internal reasoning (not emitted): user picked pause. Exit cleanly. No commit. The executor's `files_changed` was empty; if it had been non-empty, surface `git status --short` so the user can choose to stash or discard.

Output: zero new commits + clean exit.

### Example 3 — a wave with one clean task and one deviation

User invokes `/sk-build add-keyboard-shortcuts`. Wave 2 contains T-03 and T-04 (dependency-independent — both depend only on T-01 and T-02, which are already `[x]`).

**Step 5 — Executor dispatches (sequential).** Dispatch `sk-executor` for T-03. Executor returns:

```json
{
  "status": "passed",
  "files_changed": ["src/lib/keyboard-registry.ts", "src/lib/keyboard-registry.test.ts"],
  "gate_summary": {
    "typecheck": { "result": "pass", "output": "" },
    "lint":      { "result": "pass", "output": "" },
    "tests":     { "result": "pass", "output": "" }
  },
  "fix_attempts": 0
}
```

Dispatch `sk-executor` for T-04. Executor returns:

```json
{
  "status": "deviation",
  "files_changed": ["src/lib/keyboard-handler.ts"],
  "gate_summary": {
    "typecheck": { "result": "pass", "output": "" },
    "lint":      { "result": "pass", "output": "" },
    "tests":     { "result": "pass", "output": "" }
  },
  "fix_attempts": 0,
  "deviation": {
    "type": "amendment",
    "description": "KeyboardEvent.key is read-only in the target browser environment; synthetic key injection requires a wrapper type. D-03 assumes direct event mutation is available.",
    "d_nn_affected": ["D-03"],
    "goal_change": false
  }
}
```

**Step 6 — Verification gate FRESH (T-03).** Run typecheck → pass. Run lint → pass. Run tests → pass. Dispatch `sk-spec-reviewer` for T-03 → `{ "verdict": "pass", "reasoning": "Diff adds KeyboardRegistry class at the named path; all T-03 acceptance criteria met." }`.

Internal reasoning (not emitted): T-03 is clean (gate passed). T-04 has a deviation — collect it for batching. Pipe T-04's `deviation` block to `classify-deviation` → `verdict: "proceed"`, route `amendment` (1 D-NN, no goal change, short description). No mismatch.

**Step 7 — Resolve wave 2.**

Step 1 (commit clean tasks): Stage `src/lib/keyboard-registry.ts`, `src/lib/keyboard-registry.test.ts`, and the PLAN.md T-03 tick. Commit: `feat(lib): add KeyboardRegistry [T-03]`. Print `✓ T-03 — committed <sha>`.

Step 2 (collect deviations): One deviation — T-04. Q1 heuristics validated above; routing context recorded to `.sidekick/state/add-keyboard-shortcuts/build.json`.

Step 3 (surface the batch):

```
Wave 2 — 1 deviation to route

/sk-build paused at T-04.

Implementation introduces a deviation from RFC.md:

  Design said:  D-03 — direct KeyboardEvent mutation for synthetic key injection
  Discovered:   KeyboardEvent.key is read-only; direct mutation unavailable
  Proposed:     Introduce a wrapper type for synthetic events

Classify:
  /sk-build amend "<rationale>"   → append A-NN to RFC.md, continue
  /sk-design add-keyboard-shortcuts → loop back, redesign approach
  /sk-build skip                  → continue without recording
  /sk-decide <topic>              → record as system rule first
  /sk-build pause                 → halt for thinking
```

User responds: `amend "KeyboardEvent.key is spec-frozen; wrapper type is the correct abstraction"`.

Step 4 (apply verb — amend): A-NN counter for this RFC.md is currently 0 → A-01. Append A-01 to `## Amendments`. Stage `src/lib/keyboard-handler.ts` + RFC.md A-01 + PLAN.md T-04 tick. Commit: `feat(lib): wrap synthetic KeyboardEvent in handler [T-04]`. Print `✓ T-04 — committed <sha>`.

Step 5 (advance): batch resolved, no exit-verb fired. Loop to Step 4.

**Step 8b — Wave 2 checkpoint.** `buildCheckpoints` is `deviations-only` (default). Print `wave 2 done: committed T-03, T-04; next: wave 3 (T-05, T-06)`. Loop without pausing.

Output: 2 atomic commits (T-03 clean, T-04 with A-01 amendment), clean advance to wave 3.

<symbol_conventions>

- `T-NN` — task ID (zero-padded). Stable within a ticket; never reused.
- `D-NN` — decision ID in RFC.md `## Decisions`. Stable; referenced from amendments and redesigns.
- `A-NN` — amendment ID in RFC.md `## Amendments`. Counter per ticket; A-01 first.
- `R-NN` — redesign ID in RFC.md `## Redesigns`. Owned by `/sk-design`; `/sk-build` does not write to `## Redesigns` — it defers via the redesign prompt's `Recommended:` line.
- `<slug>` — the positional argument identifying the plan directory (`.sidekick/plans/<slug>/`).
- `⚠` — mismatch flag prepended to the amendment prompt when the subagent's classification disagrees with heuristics.
