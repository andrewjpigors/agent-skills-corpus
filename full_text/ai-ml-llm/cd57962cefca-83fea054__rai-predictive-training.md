# Predictive Training
<!-- v1-SENSITIVE -->

> **Early access.** The RAI predictive reasoner (GNN) is in early access — APIs, engine requirements, and behavior may change. Confirm the latest surface with the RelationalAI team before production use.

## Summary

**What:** Training, evaluation, and model management workflow for GNN pipelines.

**When to use:**
- Configuring the GNN estimator and hyperparameters
- Training models with `fit()`
- Generating predictions on test data
- Evaluating and debugging results
- Registering or loading saved models

**When NOT to use:**
- Defining concepts, loading data, building graphs -- see `rai-predictive-modeling`

**Overview:** 4 steps: configure GNN -> train -> predict/evaluate -> optional: register/load.

**By user intent — sections to focus on:**
- Train + read validation metric → Quick Reference + GNN Constructor + `gnn.fit()`
- + predict + downstream rule / optimization → also Predictions + Using Predictions Downstream
- + register + reload across sessions → also Model Management

## Quick Reference

### Node Classification (minimal)

```python
gnn = GNN(
    exp_database="DB", exp_schema="EXPERIMENTS",
    graph=gnn_graph, property_transformer=pt,
    train=Train, validation=Val,
    task_type="binary_classification", eval_metric="roc_auc",
    has_time_column=True, device="cuda", seed=42,
)
gnn.fit()
User.predictions = gnn.predictions(domain=Test)
```

### Default Metrics

| Task Type | Suggested Metric |
|-----------|-----------------|
| binary_classification | `roc_auc` |
| multiclass_classification | `accuracy` |
| multilabel_classification | `multilabel_auprc_macro` |
| regression | `rmse` |
| link_prediction | `link_prediction_precision@5` |
| repeated_link_prediction | `link_prediction_precision@5` |

### Prediction Attributes

| Task Type | Attributes |
|-----------|-----------|
| `binary_classification`, `multiclass_classification`, `multilabel_classification` | `.probs`, `.predicted_labels` |
| `regression` | `.predicted_value` |
| `link_prediction`, `repeated_link_prediction` | `.rank`, `.scores`, `.predicted_<target>` |

---

## GNN Constructor

### Required Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `exp_database`, `exp_schema` | Snowflake location for experiment artifacts |
| `graph` | Graph object with edges defined |
| `train`, `validation` | Relationship objects |
| `task_type` | Task type string |
| `eval_metric` | Evaluation metric string |

### Optional Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `property_transformer` | None | PropertyTransformer instance (omit for auto-inference) |
| `has_time_column` | False | Set `True` if the task table contains a time column. See § Triple-coupling rule below. |
| `dataset_alias` | None | Custom alias for the dataset |

Operational flags (`stream_logs`, `parallel_reasoners_init`, `use_current_time`, `test_batch_size`) are documented in [references/hyperparameters.md](references/hyperparameters.md) § GNN constructor operational flags.

### Triple-coupling rule for `has_time_column`

When `has_time_column=True`, three things must move together:

1. `Train`/`Val`/`Test` `Relationship(...)` signatures use the `at {Type:<slot>}` clause.
2. `PropertyTransformer(...)` is constructed with `time_col=[<Concept>.<datetime_property>]` for at least one source concept — the same property must also appear in `datetime=`.
3. `GNN(has_time_column=True, ...)`.

Setting only `has_time_column=True` without (2) raises `ValueError: has_time_column=True is set but time_col is not defined in the PropertyTransformer` from `validate_time_col` (`relationalai.semantics.reasoners.predictive.preparation`).

**`has_time_column` is not a train/test split.** It makes the relationship time-aware for the model; it does not partition train/val/test by time. For a forecast, also build the task tables with a temporal split (see `rai-predictive-modeling` § Define and Populate Concepts) — these are separate requirements.

### Node Classification Example

```python
gnn = GNN(
    exp_database="DB", exp_schema="EXPERIMENTS",
    graph=gnn_graph, property_transformer=pt,
    train=Train, validation=Val,
    task_type="binary_classification",
    eval_metric="roc_auc",
    has_time_column=True,
    device="cuda", seed=42,
    # Sweep n_epochs/lr from defaults (10 / 0.001) if learning is flat
)
gnn.fit()
```

### Link Prediction Example (temporal)

```python
gnn = GNN(
    exp_database="DB", exp_schema="EXPERIMENTS",
    graph=gnn_graph, property_transformer=pt,
    train=Train, validation=Val,
    task_type="repeated_link_prediction",
    eval_metric="link_prediction_precision@5",
    has_time_column=True,
    device="cuda", seed=42,
    head_layers=2,           # deeper head helps rank quality (default 1)
    label_smoothing=True,    # skill recommends True for link prediction (library default False)
)
gnn.fit()
```

**Note:** `gnn.fit()` trains at most once per GNN instance. If training has already completed (or is in progress), subsequent calls to `fit()` are silent no-ops. To retrain -- e.g. with different hyperparameters -- construct a new `GNN` instance.

**Multi-GNN pipelines on the same model.** Train multiple GNNs over the same entity set (e.g. regression + classification + link-prediction on the same graph) by reusing one `Graph` and one `PropertyTransformer` across all `GNN` instances; vary `task_type`, `eval_metric`, `train`/`validation`, and the source/target concepts. Bind each task's predictions to a **distinct attribute name** -- the convention `Source.predictions` collides if one source concept hosts more than one task.

```python
shared = dict(graph=gnn_graph, property_transformer=pt)
gnn_a  = GNN(**shared, train=TrainA, validation=ValA, task_type="regression", eval_metric="rmse")
gnn_b  = GNN(**shared, train=TrainB, validation=ValB, task_type="binary_classification", eval_metric="roc_auc")
gnn_c  = GNN(**shared, train=TrainC, validation=ValC, task_type="repeated_link_prediction", eval_metric="link_prediction_precision@5")
for g in (gnn_a, gnn_b, gnn_c): g.fit()

# Distinct attributes when a source concept hosts multiple predictions:
Item.value_predictions = gnn_a.predictions(domain=TestA)
User.label_predictions = gnn_b.predictions(domain=TestB)
User.link_predictions  = gnn_c.predictions(domain=TestC)
```

Hyperparameters can also be passed as a dictionary:

```python
train_config = {"device": "cuda", "n_epochs": 10, "lr": 0.001, "train_batch_size": 512, "seed": 42}
gnn = GNN(exp_database="DB", exp_schema="EXPERIMENTS", graph=gnn_graph, property_transformer=pt, **train_config)
# train=, validation=, task_type= are still required (as in the calls above) — the dict carries only tuning params
gnn.fit()
```

**Unknown keys raise actionable errors.** `validate_train_params` (`relationalai.semantics.reasoners.predictive.preparation`) rejects unknown `**train_params` keys with a `ValueError` and uses `difflib` to suggest near-matches; if you accidentally pass a `GNN(...)` constructor parameter (e.g. `task_type=`) inside `train_params`, the message tells you it belongs on the constructor. Read the suggestion before second-guessing the typo.

## Common Hyperparameters

The full hyperparameter reference (every `TrainerConfig` field, library defaults, and typical-override examples) lives in [references/hyperparameters.md](references/hyperparameters.md). The most common knobs and their library defaults:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `device` | `"cuda"` | `"cuda"` (GPU) or `"cpu"` |
| `n_epochs` | 10 | Number of training epochs |
| `lr` | 0.001 | Learning rate |
| `train_batch_size` | 128 | Training batch size |

For link prediction, also consider: `head_layers=2`, `num_negative=20`, `label_smoothing=True`.

**`device="cuda"` is a paired requirement.** The client-side flag alone is not enough — the predictive reasoner engine must also be GPU-sized in `raiconfig.yaml`. Configure both or neither; mismatched settings silently fall back or fail. Heuristic: CPU HIGHMEM tiers trade training speed for more RAM; GPU is faster per epoch when the dataset fits in the GPU VM's CPU memory, HIGHMEM otherwise.

**A GNN workflow touches multiple reasoner engines — size each per its role.** At minimum, the **predictive** engine runs `fit()` and prediction jobs, and the **logic** engine runs model definitions, queries, and downstream rule evaluation; predict-then-optimize pipelines also need the **prescriptive** engine. Each is configured independently in `raiconfig.yaml` under `reasoners:` with its own `name` and `size` — appropriate sizing differs per role (GPU for predictive training, HIGHMEM CPU for logic query and rule workloads, and per-problem sizing for prescriptive). Mis-sizing one engine doesn't error loudly; the workflow still runs and silently under-performs or hits memory limits on that engine's step.

**Auto-suspend during iteration.** Set a low `auto_suspend_mins` on every engine you're using — idle pool cost can dominate total spend on small workloads. Warm pools make sense only for scheduled/production cadence. Specific tier names and per-cloud memory-vs-compute tradeoffs change over time — ask the RelationalAI team for current sizing. Full `raiconfig.yaml` structure (including the `reasoners:` block for all engine types) lives in the RAI configuration/setup skill.

**Pre-flight check the GPU compute pool before long `fit()` runs.** The predictive reasoner provisions onto a Snowpark Container Services GPU compute pool. Confirming the pool is active up front is cheap hygiene; if it's auto-suspended, jobs may queue without surfacing a clear progress signal. Substitute the pool name your account uses — `SYSTEM_COMPUTE_POOL_GPU` is the Snowflake-provided default; some accounts have a custom pool referenced from `raiconfig.yaml`:

```sql
SHOW COMPUTE POOLS;                                    -- list all + check state
ALTER COMPUTE POOL <your_gpu_pool> RESUME;             -- if state=SUSPENDED
```

For all hyperparameters and tuning guidance, see [references/hyperparameters.md](references/hyperparameters.md).

## Training

### fit() Stages

`gnn.fit()` runs three stages internally:
1. Data preparation and feature extraction
2. Model training over `n_epochs`
3. Evaluation on the validation set

### Timing expectations

`gnn.fit()` and `gnn.predictions()` both submit Snowpark Container Services jobs that can run for many minutes — the long quiet between submission and completion is **expected**, not stuck.

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `stream_logs=True` (default) | `fit()` blocks until training completes — log streaming runs synchronously inside `fit()` (`relationalai.semantics.reasoners.predictive.estimator._stream_logs_formatted`). The console silence after "Training job submitted" is the streamer waiting on log buffers, not a stalled client. |
| `stream_logs=False` | `fit()` returns shortly after submission with "Job submitted and running in background." `predictions()` then waits — `_wait_obtain_model_run_id` blocks for training completion before submitting the prediction job. |
| In both modes | `predictions()` always blocks until the prediction job completes (`_wait_for_completion`). |

Treat the run as "long-running" until it crosses **~5× the dataset-prep time printed at Step 1** before suspecting it's stuck. At that point run the diagnostic ladder below before suspending or killing anything.

### "Training appears stuck"

Once the run crosses the ~5×-prep-time threshold above, run the three-step diagnostic ladder in [`references/known-limitations.md`](references/known-limitations.md) § "Training appears stuck" — diagnostic ladder before suspending or killing anything: (1) `GET_REASONER('predictive', …)` for pod status, (2) `client.jobs.list("Predictive", …)` for job state, (3) `SHOW EXPERIMENTS` for artifact creation. Each step localizes the failure before the next so you don't suspend the wrong reasoner.

### Known Limitations & Runtime Troubleshooting

GNN training has runtime gotchas that surface as opaque or no-error symptoms in the client. Use this table to recognize each one; load `references/known-limitations.md` for full causes (with SDK source citations), the before/after fallback code for `has_time_column=True` at scale, and the `GET_TRANSACTION_ARTIFACTS` recipe.

| Symptom | Recover via |
|---|---|
| `has_time_column=True` fails with `no time column defined in data tables` | Temporal setup is incomplete. Verify (1) the relationship signature includes `at {Type:<slot>}`, (2) the time column is bound in `define(Train(Source, train.<time_col>, ...))`, (3) the column is a true `DATE`/`TIMESTAMP*` per `rai-predictive-modeling` § Auto-Discovery step 8. If all three are correct and the error persists, fall back to `has_time_column=False` + non-temporal Relationships. |
| Train job stays `QUEUED` indefinitely while reasoner reports `READY` | `rai-health` § Predictive train jobs stuck QUEUED (`SUSPEND_REASONER` + `RESUME_REASONER_ASYNC`) |
| `gnn.fit()` returns a `model_run_id` from an earlier job after a partial failure or notebook re-run | `gnn.fit()` is idempotent if `self.train_job` exists and isn't FAILED — re-instantiate `GNN(...)` on every retry, not bump `Model("...")` |
| Client polls forever with no progress | `JobMonitor._wait_for_completion` has no timeout — kill the client manually + recover via the QUEUED runbook |
| `Failed to pull data into index: transaction was aborted (runtime error)` | Opaque wrapper — pull `RELATIONALAI.API.GET_TRANSACTION_ARTIFACTS('<txn_id>')` -> `problems.json` for the real error. For the schema-drift / compiled-relation-cache cause: rename `Model(...)` |

For predictive train issues, stay on the supported `RELATIONALAI.API.*` surface — `SUSPEND_REASONER` / `RESUME_REASONER_ASYNC` for recovery, `DELETE_REASONER` + `CREATE_REASONER_ASYNC('predictive', '<name>', 'GPU_NV_S', OBJECT_CONSTRUCT())` for a fresh rebuild. See `rai-health` § Predictive train jobs stuck QUEUED.

## Predictions

After training, generate predictions on the test set. Two valid binding patterns:

```python
# Pattern 1 — bind to a concept attribute (queryable via select()):
Source.predictions = gnn.predictions(domain=Test)

# Pattern 2 — assign to a plain Python variable (re-callable):
predictions = gnn.predictions(domain=Test)
```

Each concept-attribute name can be assigned **once per session** — re-binding `Source.predictions` raises `[Duplicate relationship]`. To call `predictions()` multiple times in one session, use Pattern 2 or a fresh attribute name (e.g. `Source.predictions_v2`).

**Silent corruption — Pattern 2 cartesian-joins against bare source columns.** A plain-variable prediction relation is not bound to the source concept, so selecting the source's own columns alongside it cross-joins every source row with every prediction — N² rows with plausible-looking values and no error. Row count is the only tell: verify it equals the domain size.

```python
# WRONG — Source.id is unbound relative to preds: N×N rows, no error.
preds = gnn.predictions(domain=Test)
select(Source.id, preds.probs).where(preds).inspect()

# CORRECT (option A) — bound attribute joins per-row:
Source.predictions = gnn.predictions(domain=Test)
select(Source.id, Source.predictions.probs).where(Source.predictions).inspect()

# CORRECT (option B) — reach the source through the relation's own field,
# indexed by the source concept's field name (see [evaluation-debugging.md](references/evaluation-debugging.md)):
select(preds["source"].id, preds.probs).where(preds).inspect()
```

With Pattern 2, never select the bare source concept's columns next to the relation — go through the relation's own fields, or use Pattern 1.

### Per-task result access

Each task type exposes its results as attributes on the prediction relation (summary table in Quick Reference above) — classification: `.probs` / `.predicted_labels`; regression: `.predicted_value`; link prediction: `.rank` / `.scores` / `.predicted_<target>` (always lowercase: Target `Item` -> `.predicted_item`). Swap `.inspect()` for `.to_df()` to get a pandas DataFrame. Full per-task code shapes including the link-prediction target join: [references/prediction-attributes.md](references/prediction-attributes.md); dictionary-style field indexing (when the source concept name conflicts with an existing attribute) and `gnn.prediction_concept` direct access: [references/evaluation-debugging.md](references/evaluation-debugging.md).

---

## Using Predictions Downstream

Once `Source.predictions = gnn.predictions(...)` runs, predictions are bound to the source concept and accessible via `Source.predictions.<attribute>` throughout the **same `Model`**. Other reasoners (rules, prescriptive, graph) consume them by deriving new properties from those attributes.

### Same-model pattern (default)

Keep training, prediction, and downstream reasoning in one `Model`. This is the idiomatic RAI flow for predict-then-optimize and predict-then-rules chains:

```python
# 1. Train and bind predictions
Item.predictions = gnn.predictions(domain=Test)

# 2. Derive a regular property from the prediction
Item.predicted_value = model.Property(f"{Item} has {Float:predicted_value}")
model.define(Item.predicted_value(Item.predictions.predicted_value))

# 3a. Predictive -> Rules: boolean flag
Item.is_high = model.Relationship(f"{Item} is high")
model.where(Item.predicted_value > threshold).define(Item.is_high())

# 3b. Predictive -> Prescriptive: Item.predicted_value can appear in
# Problem(model, Float) constraint / objective expressions.
```

### Cross-session pattern (explicit persistence)

If training and downstream reasoning run in separate processes, persist predictions to Snowflake and reload them as a fresh `Concept`:

```python
# Training session: save predictions DataFrame
df = select(Source.source_id, Source.predictions.predicted_value) \
     .where(Source.predictions).to_df()
# Then write_pandas(conn, df, "MY_PREDICTIONS", auto_create_table=True, overwrite=True)
# Grant SELECT on MY_PREDICTIONS to APPLICATION RELATIONALAI.

# Downstream session: load as a Concept in a new Model
Prediction = Concept("Prediction", identify_by={"source_id": Integer})
model.define(Prediction.new(Table("DB.SCHEMA.MY_PREDICTIONS").to_schema()))
# Derive properties from Prediction, apply rules, run a solver, etc.
```

`database=` and `schema=` on `GNN(...)` are optional and omitted throughout this skill. For durable persistence, use the explicit `write_pandas` path above.

### Aggregation and bridge concepts

When the downstream reasoner's scope differs from the GNN source -- e.g. per-source predictions feeding a per-target optimizer -- aggregate predictions via `aggregates.<agg>(...).per(Target).where(join)` and attach the result to a **bridge concept** representing the downstream scope:

```python
# GNN source predicts a value per Source (e.g. per-event regression);
# downstream scope is OptTarget, one row per coarser entity.
OptTarget = Concept("OptTarget", identify_by={"opt_target_id": Integer})
OptTarget.total_predicted_value = model.Property(f"{OptTarget} has {Float:total_predicted_value}")

agg = aggregates.sum(Source.predictions.predicted_value).per(OptTarget).where(
    Interaction.target_id == OptTarget.opt_target_id,
    Interaction.source_id == Source.source_id,
)
model.define(OptTarget.total_predicted_value(agg))
```

The bridge concept (`OptTarget`) separates *what the GNN predicted at Source scope* from *what the downstream reasoner consumes at Target scope*. Skipping the bridge and trying to use `Source.predictions.predicted_value` directly in a Target-scoped constraint forces ad-hoc joins inside each rule or objective expression. For classification or link-prediction predictions, swap `sum`/`predicted_value` for `avg`/`probs` or `count`/`scores` per the rule below.

**Choose the aggregation function by target shape.** Use `sum` for additive or count-like predictions (per-event regression values rolled up to an entity total), `avg` for proportional or probability-like predictions (mean predicted score across related source entities), `count` for link-prediction hits. Mixing them produces values that look numerically fine but don't mean what downstream expects.

**Non-additive blending of multiple signals** (e.g. combining several GNN outputs, or a GNN probability with a rule-derived flag) is also a derived-property step, not a built-in `aggregates.<fn>`. Express it as ordinary arithmetic in the property definition: a multiplicative composite (`predicted_a * (1 - w * avg_b) * (1 + w * avg_c)`) for risk-uplift-style logic, or a weighted interpolation (`alpha * rule_signal + (1 - alpha) * gnn_probs`) for hybrid scoring. Keep the bridge concept distinct from the GNN source so the blend is a regular Property the downstream reasoner can consume.

**Denormalize if the target was pre-scaled at training.** If the training target was normalized (e.g. to `[0, 1]`, or z-scored), raw predictions carry that scale too. Record the denormalization factor alongside the derived property and apply it before feeding into constraints or objectives that expect real-world units -- otherwise the downstream reasoner sees tiny numbers where it expected the real-world quantity.

For a full predict-then-optimize example chaining multiple GNNs into optimizers with bridge + aggregation, see the `retail_planning` template in the templates repo.

## Evaluation & Debugging

After `gnn.fit()`, inspect what data the engine received:

```python
# Visual schema with data types — inline (Jupyter) or saved to file
gnn.display_dataset_diagram(show_dtypes=True)
gnn.save_dataset_diagram("dataset_schema.svg", show_dtypes=True)

# Full metadata dict (debugging feature types) and data-config printout
config = gnn.dataset.metadata_dict
gnn.dataset.print_data_config()
```

If results are poor, see [references/evaluation-debugging.md](references/evaluation-debugging.md) § Tuning Poor Results for the ordered checklist (dataset inspection → text-feature reduction → hyperparameter tuning) plus regression-specific sanity checks, multi-metric framing, and leakage diagnostics.

---

## Model Management

### Register a Model

After `gnn.fit()` completes:

```python
gnn.register_model(
    model_database="DB",
    model_schema="MODEL_REGISTRY",
    model_name="my_predictor",
    version_name="v1",
    comment="Initial training run",  # optional
)
```

### Load by Registry Key

```python
gnn = GNN(
    exp_database="DB", exp_schema="EXPERIMENTS",
    graph=gnn_graph, property_transformer=pt,
    source_concept=User,
    task_type="binary_classification",
    has_time_column=True,
    model_database="DB", model_schema="MODEL_REGISTRY",
    model_name="my_predictor", version_name="v1",
)
gnn.load()
User.predictions = gnn.predictions(domain=Test)
```

### Load by Run ID

Same as above, replacing the registry key params with `model_run_id="<run_id>"`.

### What to Include vs. Omit When Loading

| Include | Omit |
|---------|------|
| `exp_database`, `exp_schema` | `database`, `schema` (now optional) |
| `source_concept` (required) | `train`, `validation` |
| `task_type` (required) | `eval_metric` |
| `has_time_column=True` (if model was trained with time column) | hyperparameters (`device`, `n_epochs`, etc.) |
| `target_concept` (required for link prediction only) | |
| model identifier (registry key or run ID) | |
| `graph`, `property_transformer` (optional — defaults to the training graph and auto-inferred transformer; pass them to rebuild the GNN tables, e.g. when scoring a different test domain) | |

### Train-Register-Load Workflow

**Session 1: Train and Register**

```python
gnn = GNN(
    exp_database="DB", exp_schema="EXPERIMENTS",
    graph=gnn_graph, property_transformer=pt,
    train=Train, validation=Val,
    task_type="binary_classification", eval_metric="roc_auc",
    has_time_column=True, device="cuda", n_epochs=5, seed=42,
)
gnn.fit()
gnn.register_model(
    model_database="DB", model_schema="MODEL_REGISTRY",
    model_name="my_predictor", version_name="v1",
)
```

**Session 2: Load and Predict**

```python
# Rebuild graph and property_transformer (same structure as training)
gnn_graph = Graph(model, directed=True, weighted=False)
# ... define edges ...
pt = PropertyTransformer(...)

gnn = GNN(
    exp_database="DB", exp_schema="EXPERIMENTS",
    graph=gnn_graph, property_transformer=pt,
    source_concept=User,
    task_type="binary_classification",
    has_time_column=True,
    model_database="DB", model_schema="MODEL_REGISTRY",
    model_name="my_predictor", version_name="v1",
)
gnn.load()
User.predictions = gnn.predictions(domain=Test)
```

## Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Missing `has_time_column=True` | Templates with the "at" keyword require the flag so the trainer finds the time column | Set `has_time_column=True` when templates contain "at" |
| Using `.predicted_Item` (uppercase) | Target-attribute names are always lowercased from the Target concept name | Use `.predicted_item` |
| Invalid `task_type`/`eval_metric` combination | Not every metric applies to every task type | Check [references/task-types-and-metrics.md](references/task-types-and-metrics.md) for valid pairs |
| `register_model()` before `fit()` | Registration requires a trained model | Always call `gnn.fit()` before `gnn.register_model()` |
| `model_name` or `version_name` with spaces or special characters (e.g. `"my model"`, `"v1.0!"`) | Snowflake rejects non-identifier strings as model names, but validation only happens after full training completes | Use plain alphanumeric names with underscores only (e.g. `"my_model"`, `"V1"`) |
| Calling `register_model()` with a `(model_name, version_name)` pair that already exists in the registry | The registry enforces uniqueness — duplicate versions raise `ModelManagerError` | Use a new `version_name` (e.g. `"V2"`) or delete the existing version first |
| Calling `register_model()` on a GNN instance created in load mode | Load-mode GNN instances cannot re-register — only fit-mode instances can register models | Call `register_model()` on the `fit_gnn` instance after `fit()`, not on the `gnn` instance after `load()` |
| Omitting `graph`/`property_transformer` when loading | Load reconstructs against the same schema used during training | Provide the same `graph` and `property_transformer` used during training |
| Passing training-only params when loading | Load ignores training-time params | Omit `train`, `validation`, and hyperparameters when loading |
| Omitting `source_concept` when loading | Required to bind the loaded model to the source concept for prediction | Add `source_concept=<YourConcept>` to the load constructor |
| Omitting `task_type` when loading | Not persisted in the registry | Add `task_type="<your_task_type>"` to the load constructor |
| Omitting `target_concept` for link-prediction load | Required to resolve the prediction target concept | Add `target_concept=<YourTargetConcept>` for link prediction |
| Omitting `has_time_column` when loading a temporal model | Not persisted in the registry | Re-supply `has_time_column=True` at load time |
| Calling `fit()` on a GNN instance created in load mode | Load-mode GNN instances do not support training | Create a separate fit-mode GNN instance (with `train=`, `validation=`) and call `fit()` on that |
| Calling `load()` on a GNN instance created in fit mode (with `train=`, `validation=`) | Fit-mode GNN instances do not support `load()` | Create a separate load-mode GNN instance (with `source_concept=`, `model_name=`, `version_name=`) and call `load()` on that |
| `has_time_column=True` fails with "no time column defined in data tables" | Temporal setup is incomplete. The relationship signature must use `at {Type:<slot>}`, the time column must be bound in the corresponding `define(Train(...))` call, and the column must be a true `DATE`/`TIMESTAMP*` type | Confirm all three conditions above. If correct and the error persists, fall back to `has_time_column=False` with non-temporal Relationships as a workaround |
| `SnowflakeTableObjectsException: Failed to pull data into index: transaction was aborted (runtime error)` | Opaque client wrapper that hides the actual server-side error (commonly a stale compiled-relation signature after schema drift, but other causes possible) | Pull `problems.json` via `RELATIONALAI.API.GET_TRANSACTION_ARTIFACTS('<txn_id>')` (presigned URL) and read the `report` field for the real error. For the schema-drift case specifically, see § Known Limitations |
| `gnn.fit()` raises `PermissionError` with *"Database does not exist or the GNN RelationalAI Native App lacks permissions"* (or *"Schema does not exist or ..."*) — from `relationalai_gnns.core.diagnostics.PermissionDiagnostic` | RAI app missing one or more of the four required grants on the experiment database/schema | Apply all four grants per `rai-predictive-modeling` § Prerequisites: `USAGE` on the database, `USAGE` on the schema, `CREATE EXPERIMENT` on the schema, `CREATE MODEL` on the schema |
