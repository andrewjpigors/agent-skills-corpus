# WF1: Issue Creation Workflow (v1.0)

<role>
You are the WF1 orchestrator implementing a 9-step issue creation workflow. You guide the user from raw intent through brainstorming, multi-agent critique, ambiguity resolution, user review, and GitHub issue creation. You enforce quality gates at each step and NEVER auto-transition to WF2 (Feature Implementation).
</role>

<constants>
MAX_LOOPBACK_ITERATIONS = 2
VOLUME_THRESHOLDS:
  Critical: 5
  High: 5
  Medium: 10
  Low: 10
TEMPLATE_DIR = ".github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE"
</constants>

<config-loading>
Before executing any workflow steps, load the project configuration:

1. Determine the active project using this fallback chain:
   **Level 1 -- Conversation context:** If a previous `/rawgentic:switch` in this session set the active project, use that.
   **Level 2 -- Session registry:** Read `claude_docs/session_registry.jsonl`. Grep for your session_id. If found, use the project from the most recent matching line.
   **Level 3 -- Workspace default:** Read `.rawgentic_workspace.json` from the Claude root directory. If exactly one project has `active == true`, use it. If multiple projects are active, STOP and tell user: "Multiple active projects. Run `/rawgentic:switch <name>` to bind this session."

   At any level:
   - `.rawgentic_workspace.json` missing -> STOP. Tell user: "No rawgentic workspace found. Run /rawgentic:new-project."
   - `.rawgentic_workspace.json` malformed -> STOP. Tell user: "Workspace file is corrupted. Run /rawgentic:new-project to regenerate, or fix manually."
   - No active project found at any level -> STOP. Tell user: "No active project. Run /rawgentic:new-project to set one up, or /rawgentic:switch to bind this session."
   - **Path resolution:** The `activeProject.path` may be relative (e.g., `./projects/my-app`). Resolve it against the Claude root directory (the directory containing `.rawgentic_workspace.json`) to get the absolute path for file operations.

1b. **Disabled skill check:** After resolving the active project, read `.rawgentic_workspace.json` (if not already read in step 1) and find the active project's entry.
   - If the project entry has a `disabledSkills` array and this skill's bare name appears in it: **STOP.**
     - If the skill is one of {implement-feature, fix-bug, create-tests, update-docs}, tell user:
       "You chose [mapped BMAD alternative] for [skill] in [project]. To change, re-run `/rawgentic:setup` or edit `disabledSkills` in `.rawgentic_workspace.json`."
       Mapping: implement-feature -> bmad-dev-story, fix-bug -> bmad-dev-story, create-tests -> bmad-tea agent / bmad-testarch-* workflows, update-docs -> BMAD tech-writer.
     - Otherwise, tell user:
       "Skill [name] is disabled in [project]. Remove it from `disabledSkills` in `.rawgentic_workspace.json` to re-enable."
   - If workspace `bmadDetected` is true but the project entry has **no** `disabledSkills` field: **STOP.** Tell user:
     "BMAD detected but no skill preferences configured for [project]. Run `/rawgentic:switch` or `/rawgentic:setup` to configure."
   - Otherwise: proceed to step 2.

2. Load the config and derive capabilities with the helper CLI (one tested
   source of truth — never hand-derive the `capabilities` object, so all 11
   workflow skills and the docs table cannot drift apart):
   ```bash
   python3 hooks/capabilities_lib.py derive \
     --config <activeProject.path>/.rawgentic.json
   ```
   - **Non-zero exit** -> the config is missing, corrupt, or invalid. **STOP** and relay the printed message (it directs the user to `/rawgentic:setup`). A `config.version` mismatch is only a stderr warning and does NOT stop the workflow.
   - **Exit 0** -> stdout is `{"config": {...}, "capabilities": {...}}`. Use the parsed `config` object and the derived `capabilities` object for all subsequent steps. The `capabilities` fields are: `has_tests`, `test_commands`, `has_ci`, `has_deploy`, `deploy_method`, `has_database`, `has_docker`, `project_type`, `repo`, `default_branch`, `migration_dir`. Carry these values as literals into later commands (each step is its own Bash call, so shell variables do not persist across them).

All subsequent steps use `config` and `capabilities` — never probe the filesystem for information that should be in the config.
</config-loading>

<environment-setup>
Constants are populated at workflow start (Step 1) from the config loaded in `<config-loading>`:
- `capabilities.repo`: from config.repo.fullName
- `capabilities.default_branch`: from config.repo.defaultBranch

If config loading fails, STOP and follow the error instructions in `<config-loading>`. Do not assume values.
</environment-setup>

<termination-rule>
WF1 ALWAYS terminates after issue creation. WF2 (Feature Implementation) requires explicit, separate invocation. There is NO auto-transition from WF1 to WF2 under ANY circumstance. Do not suggest "shall I implement this?" or "would you like to start WF2?" WF1 terminates ONLY after the completion-gate passes. All steps must have markers in session notes.
</termination-rule>

<context-compaction>
Per CLAUDE.md shared invariant #9: before context compaction, document in `claude_docs/session_notes.md`: current step number, loop-back iteration count, circuit breaker state (clear/blocked), issue type (feature/bug), and critique findings summary if past Step 3.
</context-compaction>

<ambiguity-circuit-breaker>
Per CLAUDE.md shared invariant #1: STOP and ask the user when critique findings are ambiguous, conflicting, or require judgment calls not covered by the original description. This circuit breaker fires in Step 4 but the principle applies throughout the workflow — if ANY step encounters ambiguity that could lead to a wrong outcome, STOP and ask rather than guess.
</ambiguity-circuit-breaker>

<step-tracking>
At the end of each step, log a marker in `claude_docs/session_notes.md`:
`### WF1 Step X: <Name> — DONE (<key detail>)`
This enables workflow resumption if context is lost.
</step-tracking>

## Step 1: Receive User Intent

### Instructions

1. Acknowledge the user's request.
2. **Execute `<config-loading>`** to load project configuration and build capabilities. Log resolved values in session notes. If config loading fails, follow the error instructions in `<config-loading>`.
3. Classify the intent as "feature" or "bug" based on the description provided.
4. If classification is ambiguous, ask: "Is this a feature request (new functionality) or a bug report (existing behavior that is broken)?"
5. Check for sufficient information to generate meaningful acceptance criteria. If insufficient, ask targeted clarifying questions:
   - For features: "What is the desired behavior? Which part of the system is affected? What problem does this solve?"
   - For bugs: "What is the expected behavior? What is the actual behavior? Can you reproduce it? Which VM/container is affected?"
6. Run a deduplication check:
   ```bash
   gh issue list --repo ${capabilities.repo} --search "<keywords from description>" --limit 10
   ```
7. If potential duplicates found, present them to the user and ask: "Any of these existing issues cover your request?"
8. Update `claude_docs/session_notes.md` with: issue description, classification (feature/bug), initial scope hints, duplicate check results.
9. Confirm classification with the user before proceeding.

### Output Format

Present to user:

```
Issue Classification:
- Type: [feature / bug]
- Summary: [one-sentence summary of the intent]
- Scope hints: [components/systems mentioned]
- Existing issues found: [list or "none"]

Proceeding to brainstorm. Confirm or correct this classification.
```

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding to Step 2.

#### Failure Modes

- User provides insufficient information → ask targeted clarifying questions (expected behavior, actual behavior, affected system area). Do not proceed until intent is clear enough to generate meaningful acceptance criteria.
- Classification ambiguous (could be feature or bug) → ask explicitly: "Is this a feature request or a bug report?"
- Dedup check finds a matching issue → present to user and ask if it covers their request before proceeding

---

## Step 2: Brainstorm Feature/Bug Details

### Instructions

**Brainstorming approach:** For complex features (multi-component, architectural changes), invoke `superpowers:brainstorming` to run the full design pipeline (context exploration → clarifying questions → approach proposals → design validation). For simpler features or bug reports, proceed with inline brainstorming using the instructions below. The tooling audit recommends `superpowers:brainstorming` as the primary tool for Step 2.

1. Read the matching GitHub issue template:
   - Feature: `${activeProject.path}/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`
   - Bug: `${activeProject.path}/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`

2. Read codebase context:
   - config (architecture from config.services and config.techStack, quality standards from project conventions)
   - MEMORY.md (project memory, infrastructure context)
   - Relevant source files identified from scope hints

3. Use Serena MCP (`find_symbol`, `get_symbols_overview`) to verify that any components, files, or symbols referenced in the brainstorm actually exist in the codebase.

4. Generate a comprehensive draft issue specification that MUST conform to the template structure. Include:
   - **Title:** Conventional format (`feat(scope): description` or `fix(scope): description`)
   - **Description:** Detailed with context and motivation
   - **Acceptance criteria:** Numbered, testable, specific (minimum 3 criteria)
   - **Scope:** Explicit in-scope AND out-of-scope lists
   - **Affected components:** Verified against actual codebase (use Serena)
   - **Risk assessment:** Dependencies, blockers, security implications
   - **Complexity:** T-shirt size (S/M/L/XL) with justification
   - **Related issues:** Cross-reference from dedup search

   For bugs, additionally include:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - Environment details
   - Error logs (if available)

5. Optionally, if the feature is complex and would benefit from divergent thinking, use the sdd:create-ideas technique: generate 6 approaches (3 high-probability, 3 tail-of-distribution) before selecting the best approach for the specification.

6. If the feature involves a library or framework API, use Context7 MCP (`resolve-library-id` → `query-docs`) to fetch up-to-date documentation before finalizing the specification.

### Output

The draft specification is an internal working artifact. Do NOT present it to the user yet -- it goes directly to Step 3 for critique.

#### Failure Modes

- Brainstorm produces overly vague acceptance criteria → the critique step (Step 3) will catch this
- Brainstorm hallucinates non-existent components or files → the critique step verifies claims against actual codebase via Serena
- Brainstorm duplicates an existing issue → brainstorm should include a dedup check via `gh issue list --search`
- No issue template exists in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` → create the template first, then proceed with brainstorm

---

## Step 3: Full Critique of Brainstorm Output

### Instructions

**Critique method preference:** Before running the critique, check the active project entry's `critiqueMethod` field in `.rawgentic_workspace.json`. If set to `"bmad-party-mode"`, use bmad-party-mode instead of the 3-judge critique below. If missing or `"reflexion"`, proceed as normal.

1. Launch all three judges in a single message with three parallel Agent tool calls (subagent_type="general-purpose"), each operating independently:

   **Judge 1: Requirements Validator**
   - Evaluate: completeness of acceptance criteria, scope clarity, edge case coverage, template conformance
   - Verify: all referenced components/files exist (use Serena MCP via `find_symbol`)
   - Check: deduplication against existing issues

   **Judge 2: Solution Architect**
   - Evaluate: feasibility, complexity estimate accuracy, hidden dependencies
   - Check: consistency with existing architecture (from config.services, config.techStack)
   - Assess: risk assessment completeness

   **Judge 3: Code Quality Reviewer**
   - Evaluate: acceptance criteria testability, scope boundaries, wording clarity
   - Check: alignment with project security standards (from config.security)
   - Verify: no hallucinated claims about codebase capabilities

2. Each judge produces findings with the following structure per finding:

   ```
   Finding #N:
   - Severity: Critical | High | Medium | Low
   - Category: completeness | accuracy | feasibility | consistency | deduplication | template_conformance
   - Description: [what the issue is]
   - Recommendation: [specific action to take]
   - Ambiguity flag: clear | ambiguous
   - Ambiguity reason: [why, if ambiguous]
   ```

3. Synthesize findings across all three judges. Conduct a debate round if judges disagree on a finding. Unresolved disagreements are flagged as ambiguous.

4. **Volume threshold check** (independent per tier, not combined):
   - More than 5 Critical findings: TRIGGER LOOP-BACK
   - More than 5 High findings: TRIGGER LOOP-BACK
   - More than 10 Medium findings: TRIGGER LOOP-BACK
   - More than 10 Low findings: TRIGGER LOOP-BACK

5. **If loop-back triggered:**
   - Check `loop_iteration` counter.
   - If `loop_iteration < MAX_LOOPBACK_ITERATIONS` (i.e., < 2):
     - Increment `loop_iteration`.
     - Present ALL findings to the user as targeted clarifying questions.
     - Work through each finding to tighten requirements.
     - Return to Step 2 (re-brainstorm with improved requirements).
   - If `loop_iteration >= MAX_LOOPBACK_ITERATIONS`:
     - STOP looping. Escalate to user:
       ```
       After 2 requirement refinement iterations, the critique still produces findings
       above volume thresholds. Here is the full finding list:
       [all findings]
       Please review and decide how to proceed:
       (a) Continue with current findings (proceed to Step 4)
       (b) Abandon this issue and start over
       (c) Provide additional clarification and retry
       ```
     - Wait for user decision before proceeding.

6. **If volume thresholds pass:** Proceed to Step 4 with the full findings list.

### Output

Prioritized findings list with severity tiers and ambiguity flags. This is NOT presented to the user directly -- it feeds into Step 4.

#### Failure Modes

- Critique finds zero issues (suspicious) → verify the critique sub-agents actually read the codebase context and that debate rounds occurred
- Finding volume exceeds thresholds → loop back to Step 2 for requirements clarification (max 2 iterations)
- Critique sub-agents disagree fundamentally → unresolved disagreements are flagged as ambiguous for user attention in Step 4

---

## Step 4: Apply Critique Findings (with Ambiguity Circuit Breaker)

### Instructions

This step implements the circuit breaker logic. It is prompt-level logic, not a separate tool.

0. **Adversarial review sub-step (opt-in, cross-model — runs FIRST).** Before scanning findings, optionally augment the Step 3 critique with a cross-model (Codex) review of the **draft issue spec**. This is **DEFAULT-OFF** because WF1 already runs a full same-model 3-judge critique at Step 3; the cross-model pass is additive and opt-in. Gate it on project opt-in (check FIRST so a disabled project is a true no-op — no temp file, no subprocess):
   ```bash
   python3 hooks/adversarial_review_lib.py is-enabled \
     --workspace .rawgentic_workspace.json --project <name> --skill create-issue
   ```
   The command exits `0` when enabled for `create-issue` and non-zero otherwise. If non-zero, **skip silently** — behavior is byte-for-byte unchanged. When enabled, write the draft spec to a temp file under the project and invoke `/rawgentic:adversarial-review <spec-path> spec`. It is **report-only**; **merge** its findings into the Step 3 findings list, tagging each `source: adversarial` (reflexion findings are `source: reflexion`). The merged set then flows through the ambiguity scan and circuit breaker below (items 1–4) — so an ambiguous adversarial finding correctly triggers the breaker and is presented to the user alongside the rest.
   - **WF1 has NO `plan_lib` loop-back counter** (its only loop-back is `loop_iteration`, which lives in Step 3's volume-threshold check — already passed by the time we reach Step 4). Therefore the adversarial sub-step does **NOT** call `plan_lib.consume_loopback` and does **NOT** re-trigger Step 3's volume thresholds; adversarial findings are resolved purely through this step's circuit breaker / amendment flow.
   - **Codex failure is non-blocking** (the same-model critique already ran): on ANY non-success from the review — not installed, unauthenticated, timeout, error, parse error, including in headless mode — do NOT trigger the ERROR protocol and do NOT block issue creation; skip the adversarial layer, log loudly in session notes, and continue with the reflexion findings only. (Only the standalone `/rawgentic:adversarial-review` skill ERRORs on an unmet Codex prerequisite.)
   - Log a marker: `### WF1 Step 4 — Adversarial Review (invoked|skipped): <report path or skip reason>`.

1. **Scan all findings for ambiguity:**

   ```
   ambiguous_findings = [f for f in findings if f.ambiguity_flag == "ambiguous"]
   ```

2. **Check for pairwise conflicts:**
   For each pair of findings (finding_i, finding_j):
   - Do their recommendations contradict each other? (e.g., "narrow scope to X" vs. "add acceptance criteria for Y which is outside X")
   - If yes, add both to `conflicting_findings` list.

3. **Check for judgment-call findings:**
   For each finding:
   - Does applying it require information not present in the original user description or codebase context?
   - If yes, add to `judgment_findings` list.

4. **Circuit breaker evaluation:**

   **CLEAR PATH** (no ambiguity, no conflicts, no judgment calls):
   - Produce amendment list from ALL findings (Critical + High + Medium + Low).
   - Proceed directly to Step 5.
   - Brief notification to user: "Critique complete. N findings applied (X Critical, Y High, Z Medium, W Low). All clear -- no ambiguity detected."

   **BLOCKED PATH** (any ambiguity, conflict, or judgment call detected):
   - STOP the workflow.
   - Present the problematic findings to the user:

     ```
     CIRCUIT BREAKER TRIGGERED

     The following findings cannot be applied automatically:

     AMBIGUOUS FINDINGS:
     [list with ambiguity reasons]

     CONFLICTING FINDINGS:
     [list with conflict explanations]

     JUDGMENT-CALL FINDINGS:
     [list with explanations of what information is missing]

     Please resolve each item:
     - For ambiguous findings: clarify the intended interpretation
     - For conflicting findings: decide which finding takes priority
     - For judgment-call findings: provide the missing information

     You may also add your own amendments not raised by the critique.
     ```

   - Wait for user resolution.
   - If user rejects a Critical finding: warn that Critical findings address fundamental issues and ask for confirmation. User has final authority (P11).
   - After resolution: produce amendment list (all findings + user-added amendments).
   - Proceed to Step 5.

### Output

Amendment list with workflow_state ("clear" or "blocked_resolved").

#### Failure Modes

- User rejects a Critical finding → warn that Critical items address fundamental issues (wrong component references, security gaps) and ask for confirmation. User has final authority.
- Circuit breaker triggers on most runs → indicates the critique step is flagging too many ambiguous findings; tune ambiguity detection or improve brainstorm specificity
- User adds amendments that contradict original brainstorm intent → flag the contradiction and ask for clarification

---

## Step 5: Incorporate Amendments into Issue Specification

### Instructions

1. Take the original draft specification from Step 2 and the amendment list from Step 4.
2. For each amendment, apply the change:
   - `add_criterion`: Insert acceptance criterion in the appropriate section. Annotate: "[Added per critique finding #N]"
   - `fix_error`: Correct the error silently (wrong component name, wrong file path).
   - `adjust_scope`: Update both in-scope and out-of-scope sections.
   - `add_risk`: Append to risk assessment section.
   - `improve_wording`: Revise wording in the specified section.
   - `add_detail`: Add detail to the specified section.
3. After applying all amendments, verify:
   - No internal contradictions introduced (e.g., scope narrowed but new criteria added outside the narrowed scope).
   - Specification still conforms to the GitHub issue template structure.
   - Total length is reasonable (under 2000 words for a single issue). If over 2000 words, suggest splitting into multiple issues.
4. Produce the refined specification.

### Output

Refined issue specification (internal working artifact). Immediately proceeds to Steps 6 and 7 in parallel: Step 6 (memorization) runs as a background operation via the Agent tool with run_in_background=true, while Step 7 (user review) proceeds interactively in the foreground.

#### Failure Modes

- Amendment incorporation introduces internal contradictions (scope narrowed but new criteria added outside narrowed scope) → flag the contradiction to the user before proceeding
- Refined specification exceeds 2000 words → suggest splitting into multiple issues with cross-references

---

## Step 6: Conditional Memorization (runs in parallel with Step 7)

### Instructions

This step runs concurrently with Step 7 (User Review). It does NOT block Step 7.

1. Review the critique findings from Step 3. Identify findings that surface reusable insights -- patterns applicable beyond this specific issue:
   - Architecture constraints that future features must respect
   - Anti-patterns discovered during critique
   - Codebase conventions not yet documented
   - Recurring pitfalls that should be added to verification checklists

2. If memorizable insights exist:
   - Follow the reflexion:memorize workflow (ACE pattern):
     a. Extract the insight from critique context.
     b. Check against MEMORY.md and session notes.
     c. If novel, run /reflexion:memorize for reusable insights.
     d. If MEMORY.md is at capacity, suggest archiving stale entries or moving detailed content to topic-specific files.
   - Do NOT store in mem0 unless the insight is cross-project. If the insight IS cross-project (infrastructure, deployment, API quirks), store in mem0 via `search_memory` (check for duplicates) then `add_memory`.

3. If no memorizable insights exist: skip this step entirely. No output.

4. Periodically (suggested: every 10 `/create-issue` invocations), consider running `/reflexion:memorize` to consolidate insights. This is NOT a per-run action.

### Output

Updated memory (if insights memorized via /reflexion:memorize) or no output (if skipped). Does not affect Step 7.

#### Failure Modes

- Over-memorization: storing trivial or context-specific findings as general principles → the memorize command should filter for novelty and generalizability
- MEMORY.md at capacity → suggest archiving stale entries or moving detailed content to topic-specific files
- Duplicate memorization → the memorize command should deduplicate against existing content before appending

---

## Step 7: User Review & Refinement (runs in parallel with Step 6)

### Instructions

This step runs concurrently with Step 6 (Memorization). It does NOT wait for Step 6 to complete.

1. Present the refined specification to the user in a readable format:

   ```
   DRAFT ISSUE SPECIFICATION (Ready for Review)
   =============================================

   Title: [conventional format title]
   Type: [feature / bug]
   Labels: [label list]
   Complexity: [T-shirt size]

   --- DESCRIPTION ---
   [description text]

   --- ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA ---
   1. [criterion 1]
   2. [criterion 2]
   ...

   --- SCOPE ---
   In scope:
   - [item]
   Out of scope:
   - [item]

   --- AFFECTED COMPONENTS ---
   - [component]

   --- RISK ASSESSMENT ---
   - [risk]

   --- RELATED ISSUES ---
   - [issue ref]

   [Bug-only sections if applicable]

   =============================================
   Critique summary: N findings applied (X Critical, Y High, Z Medium, W Low)

   Review the specification above. Provide any changes, or type "approved" to proceed with issue creation.
   ```

2. If user provides feedback:
   - Incorporate the feedback into the specification.
   - Re-present the updated specification.
   - If user's feedback contradicts a critique finding from Step 3: flag the contradiction, explain which finding is affected, ask for confirmation. User has final authority.
   - Repeat until user approves.

3. If user types "approved" (or equivalent affirmation such as "looks good", "go ahead", "lgtm", "create it"):
   - Mark specification as approved.
   - Proceed to Step 8.

4. If user abandons (stops responding or says "cancel"):
   - The specification remains in draft state.
   - WF1 terminates without creating an issue.
   - Summary: "WF1 cancelled. No issue created. Draft specification is available in this conversation for future reference."

### Output

Approved specification (or cancellation). Step 8 only runs after explicit approval.

#### Failure Modes

- User requests changes that contradict critique findings from Step 3 → flag the contradiction, explain which critique finding is affected, and ask for confirmation. User has final authority.
- User abandons the review (stops responding or says "cancel") → workflow cannot proceed to Step 8 without approval; specification remains in draft state, WF1 terminates without creating an issue.

---

## Step 8: Create GitHub Issue

### Instructions

1. Render the approved specification into a markdown body string that conforms to the GitHub issue template structure.

2. Write the body to a temporary file to handle multi-line content and special characters:

   ```bash
   cat << 'ISSUE_BODY_EOF' > /tmp/wf1-issue-body.md
   [full markdown body]
   ISSUE_BODY_EOF
   ```

3. Determine labels:
   - Base label: `enhancement` for features, `bug` for bugs.
   - Scope labels: based on affected components (e.g., `engine`, `dashboard`, `ml`, `infrastructure`, `api`).
   - Only use labels that already exist in the repository. Check with:
     ```bash
     gh label list --repo ${capabilities.repo}
     ```
   - If a needed label does not exist, create it:
     ```bash
     gh label create "engine" --repo ${capabilities.repo} --description "Engine (Python backend)" --color "0E8A16"
     ```

4. Create the issue:

   ```bash
   gh issue create \
     --repo ${capabilities.repo} \
     --title "feat(engine): implement two-stage entry validation" \
     --body-file /tmp/wf1-issue-body.md \
     --label "enhancement" \
     --label "engine"
   ```

5. Capture the output URL (gh issue create prints the URL to stdout).

6. **Failure handling:**
   - Authentication failure: verify PAT with `gh auth status`. The fine-grained PAT has Issues (r/w) scope.
   - Network failure: retry once after 5 seconds. If still failing, save the specification to `${activeProject.path}/docs/plans/draft-issue-YYYY-MM-DD.md` and instruct the user to create manually.
   - Rate limiting: wait 60 seconds and retry.

7. Clean up temp file:
   ```bash
   rm -f /tmp/wf1-issue-body.md
   ```

### Output

GitHub issue URL (e.g., `https://github.com/${capabilities.repo}/issues/NNN`).

#### Failure Modes

- `gh` CLI authentication failure → verify PAT with `gh auth status`; the fine-grained PAT has Issues (r/w) scope
- Network failure → retry once after 5 seconds; if still failing, save the issue specification locally to `${activeProject.path}/docs/plans/draft-issue-YYYY-MM-DD.md` and instruct the user to create manually
- Rate limiting by GitHub API → wait 60 seconds and retry with exponential backoff

---

## Step 9: Workflow Completion Summary

### Instructions

1. Update `claude_docs/session_notes.md` with WF1 results: issue URL, type, critique findings summary, loop-back count, memorized insights.

2. Present a completion summary:

```
WF1 COMPLETE
=============

GitHub Issue: [URL] (Issue #NNN)
Type: [feature / bug]
Title: [title]

Critique Summary:
- Total findings: N
- Applied: N (X Critical, Y High, Z Medium, W Low)
- Ambiguity circuit breaker: [triggered / not triggered]
- Loop-backs: [0 / 1 / 2]
- Memorized insights: [N insights saved via /reflexion:memorize / none]

User Review: [N iterations / approved immediately]

WF1 complete. To implement this feature, invoke WF2 (Feature Implementation) separately, referencing issue #NNN.
```

Do NOT suggest auto-transitioning to WF2. Do NOT ask "shall I start implementing?" The workflow terminates here.

### Output

Completion summary message. WF1 terminates.

#### Failure Modes

- None — this is an informational step. If previous steps failed, this step reports the partial completion status.

---

<completion-gate>
Before declaring WF1 complete, verify ALL of the following. Print the checklist with pass/fail for each item:

1. [ ] Step markers logged for ALL executed steps in session notes
2. [ ] Final step output (completion summary) presented to user
3. [ ] Session notes updated with completion summary
4. [ ] Issue URL documented in session notes
5. [ ] Memorize step completed (insights saved or correctly skipped)
6. [ ] Issue body matches critique findings

If ANY item fails, go back and complete it before declaring "WF1 complete."
You may NOT output "WF1 complete" until all items pass.
</completion-gate>

---

## Workflow Resumption

If this skill is invoked mid-conversation, detect the current state:

0. All step markers present but completion-gate not printed? → Run completion-gate, then terminate.
1. Was a GitHub issue just created? → Step 9 (summary only)
