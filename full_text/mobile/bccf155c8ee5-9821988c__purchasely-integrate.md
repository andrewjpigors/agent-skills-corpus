# Purchasely SDK Integration Guide

You are guiding a developer through integrating the Purchasely SDK into their mobile app. You must write actual code into the user's project — not just explain what to do.

Reference documentation is available in the `../../references/` directory of this plugin. Before integrating, read `../../references/purchasely-architecture.md` to understand the end-to-end platform (SDK ↔ Purchasely Server ↔ stores ↔ your backend ↔ third-party tools) and the Full-mode purchase flow. If the app already sells subscriptions on the web (Stripe, another subscription platform, in-house billing), also read `../../references/cross-platform-subscriptions.md` — Purchasely accepts S2S Stripe receipts and the coexistence model has subtle defaults to know about.

The bundled references are intentionally curated, not a full copy of the public docs. If a required integration detail is missing, looks stale, or depends on an exact SDK signature / current Console behavior, verify it against the official Purchasely documentation at https://docs.purchasely.com/ before writing code.

**Universal SDK concepts** (apply to every platform — iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Cordova) are in `../../references/concepts/`. Load them as needed:

- `../../references/concepts/running-modes.md` — Full vs Observer modes, log levels
- `../../references/concepts/paywall-actions.md` — `PLYPresentationAction` enum, interceptor `proceed/processAction` rules
- `../../references/concepts/presentation-types.md` — presentation type guard (NORMAL / FALLBACK / DEACTIVATED / CLIENT)
- `../../references/concepts/presentation-cache.md` — App-side cache + **preload pattern** (fetch ahead, display instantly)
- `../../references/concepts/observer-mode-post-purchase.md` — `proceed/processAction → dismiss` ordering, chaining follow-up placements
- `../../references/concepts/programmatic-purchases.md` — Exact app-side purchase APIs by platform
- `../../references/concepts/user-attributes-targeting.md` — Audience targeting attributes
- `../../references/concepts/privacy-settings.md` — `revokeDataProcessingConsent`, essential/optional processing, GDPR/CMP choices
- `../../references/concepts/user-identity.md` — `userLogin` / `userLogout` timing + anonymous→logged-in merge
- `../../references/concepts/subscription-checks.md` — Gating premium content via `userSubscriptions`, restore purchases
- `../../references/concepts/subscription-management.md` — Opening the native Manage Subscription page (App Store / Play Store)
- `../../references/concepts/promotional-offers.md` — Offer types, Apple promotional offers, Google developer-determined offers, offer codes
- `../../references/concepts/campaigns.md` — No-code automations (trigger/placement-based), `allowDeeplink` / `allowCampaigns`, trigger/deeplink display readiness, use cases
- `../../references/concepts/lottie-animations.md` — Lottie animations in Screens (iOS / Android weak dependency bridge; cross-platform host projects)
- `../../references/concepts/analytics-integration.md` — Forwarding UI events to Firebase / Amplitude / AppsFlyer + recommended analytics wrapper pattern

**Platform-specific deep dives** (load the one(s) matching the project's platform — they hold the authoritative install snippets, init signatures, and platform-only patterns):

- `../../references/ios/initialization.md` — iOS install (CocoaPods / SPM / Carthage), `Purchasely.start(...)` signature, App Tracking Transparency hook order, StoreKit 2 setup
- `../../references/ios/api-reference.md` — full iOS API surface with signatures (init, fetch, present, attributes, login, sync, errors)
- `../../references/ios/common-patterns.md` — SwiftUI lifecycle, UIKit container embedding, `@MainActor` rules, presentation cache implementation
- `../../references/android/initialization.md` — Android install (Maven Central, store dependencies, ProGuard/R8 rules), `Purchasely.Builder` setup
- `../../references/android/api-reference.md` — full Android API surface with Kotlin/Java signatures
- `../../references/android/common-patterns.md` — Jetpack Compose embedding, Fragment vs View, lifecycle-aware patterns
- `../../references/react-native/integration.md` — RN-specific install, Metro setup, plugin alignment, store package
- `../../references/flutter/integration.md` — Flutter-specific install, MethodChannel/EventChannel bridge, plugin alignment
- `../../references/cordova/integration.md` — Cordova-specific install, plugin add, store plugin, JS callbacks

**Troubleshooting & ops** (load when needed):

- `../../references/testing/README.md` — Sandbox testing on iOS (Sandbox Apple ID) and Android (License Tester, internal track)
- `../../references/troubleshooting/debug-mode.md` — Enabling SDK debug logs + Purchasely Console-side Debug Mode (preview drafts on device)
- `../../references/troubleshooting/error-codes.md` — `PLYError` reference (iOS + Android), promotional-offer errors, Google Play Billing v8 hang
- `../../references/troubleshooting/screen-issue-report.md` — Template for escalating Screen Composer bugs to Purchasely Support

**Latest SDK versions** — always pin to the versions listed in `../../references/sdk-versions.md` (single source of truth). When this skill mentions installation, pin to exact versions from that doc, not floating versions.

## Expert checkpoint

Before writing integration code, run a Purchasely expert checkpoint. If the harness exposes the Claude Code subagent `purchasely:purchasely-sdk-expert`, invoke it and pass the detected platform, running mode, target store(s), SDK version, placement/display approach, purchase handling plan, privacy/consent requirements if any, and any uncertainty from the local project.

If that subagent is not available, do the checkpoint inline using the `purchasely-sdk-expert` guidance when available, or this fallback checklist:

- Confirm the SDK generation: React Native uses v6 (`6.0.0-rc.2`); native iOS / native Android / Flutter / Cordova use v6 (`6.0.0-rc.1`).
- Confirm versions are pinned from `../../references/sdk-versions.md` and no floating ranges are introduced.
- Confirm Full mode is explicit when Purchasely must process and validate purchases.
- Confirm the presentation path matches the platform generation and handles `DEACTIVATED` / `FALLBACK` where relevant.
- Confirm every interceptor branch resolves exactly once (`PLYInterceptResult`, `InterceptResult`, or `onProcessAction`).
- Confirm Observer-mode purchases call `synchronize()` and use the right dismissal API for the platform.
- Confirm user identity and audience attributes are set before audience-dependent presentation loading.
- Confirm any exact API signature was checked in the matching platform reference.

Incorporate corrections before editing files.

## Completion Build Gate

Before reporting the integration complete, build the user's app with the project's canonical command (prefer the existing CI/build script). If the build fails, fix the error, rerun the build, and run relevant tests again until the app builds successfully. Do not claim completion from code review or lint alone; include the exact build/test commands and outcomes in the final response.

Platform hints: Android `./gradlew assembleDebug`; iOS use `xcodebuild` with the workspace when one exists; React Native / Flutter / Cordova should build the affected native target(s), not just install packages.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` may contain an optional platform override (e.g., `ios`, `android`, `react-native`, `flutter`, `cordova`). If provided, skip platform detection and use the specified platform.

## Step 0: Detect the Platform

If no platform was specified in `$ARGUMENTS`, detect the platform by examining the project files:

| Signal | Platform |
|--------|----------|
| `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` with Kotlin/Android references | **Android** |
| `.xcodeproj`, `.xcworkspace`, or `Package.swift` with iOS targets | **iOS** |
| `package.json` containing `react-native` dependency | **React Native** |
| `pubspec.yaml` containing `purchasely_flutter` or Flutter SDK reference | **Flutter** |
| `config.xml` with `cordova` references | **Cordova** |

If multiple platforms are detected (e.g., a monorepo), ask the user which platform they want to integrate first. If no platform is detected, ask the user to specify.

## Step 1: Install the SDK

Run the appropriate installation commands and modify project files as needed.

**Versions to pin** (always read `../../references/sdk-versions.md` for the authoritative list):

| Platform | Latest stable version |
|----------|-----------------------|
| iOS (native) | **6.0.0-rc.1** |
| Android (native) | **6.0.0-rc.1** |
| Flutter | **6.0.0-rc.1** |
| React Native | **6.0.0-rc.2** |
| Cordova | **6.0.0-rc.1** |

Always pin to the **exact** version above, never floating (`5.+`, `6.+`, `^5.0.0`, `^6.0.0-rc.2`). Floating versions break reproducibility and silently pull regressions. Because these v6 versions are pre-releases, they must be pinned exactly on every layer (no caret / range).

**Before installing, ask the user these questions (adapt per platform):**

For **Android, React Native, Flutter, Cordova** — ask:
1. **Which store(s) do you target?** Google Play is the most common. Huawei AppGallery and Amazon Appstore are also supported (Android native only). The store dependency is REQUIRED and separate from the core SDK.
2. **Do you need video support in Screens?** If yes, an optional video player dependency is needed (not available on Cordova).

For **iOS** — no extra questions needed (App Store is the only store, video is included).

### iOS

Requirements: iOS 11.0+, Xcode 13.0+, Swift 5.0+ (Swift 6 strict concurrency supported)

**Option A — CocoaPods** (preferred if a `Podfile` exists):

Add to the app's `Podfile`:
```ruby
pod 'Purchasely', '6.0.0-rc.1'
```
Then run:
```bash
pod install --repo-update
```

**Option B — Swift Package Manager** (if the project uses SPM):

In Xcode: File > Add Packages, then enter the repository URL:
```
https://github.com/Purchasely/Purchasely-iOS
```
Select **Exact Version 6.0.0-rc.1** (Package.swift: `.package(url: "https://github.com/Purchasely/Purchasely-iOS", exact: "6.0.0-rc.1")`).

**Option C — Carthage**:

Add to `Cartfile`:
```
binary "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Purchasely/Purchasely-iOS/master/Purchasely.json" == 6.0.0-rc.1
```
Then run:
```bash
carthage update
```

> **Swift 6 strict concurrency.** When the host app builds with strict concurrency, add `@preconcurrency import Purchasely` at `@MainActor` call sites; test targets may relax to `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY = minimal`.

### Android

Requirements: minSdk 23, compileSdk 36, Kotlin 2.2.x, Gradle 9.x, JDK 17 (to build)

The Purchasely SDK is published on **Maven Central** — no custom repository needed. Just make sure `mavenCentral()` is present in your `settings.gradle.kts` (it is by default in modern projects).

**Add dependencies** in `app/build.gradle.kts` (pin to exact `6.0.0-rc.1` — see `../../references/sdk-versions.md`):
```kotlin
dependencies {
    // Core SDK — Required
    implementation("io.purchasely:core:6.0.0-rc.1")

    // Google Play Store — Required if publishing on Google Play
    implementation("io.purchasely:google-play:6.0.0-rc.1")

    // Video Player — Optional, for video support in Screens
    implementation("io.purchasely:player:6.0.0-rc.1")
}
```

**Alternative stores** (instead of or in addition to Google Play):
```kotlin
// Huawei AppGallery (also requires Huawei AGConnect plugin and repo)
implementation("io.purchasely:huawei-services:6.0.0-rc.1")

// Amazon Appstore
implementation("io.purchasely:amazon:6.0.0-rc.1")
```

For **Huawei**, also add to the project-level build.gradle:
```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://developer.huawei.com/repo/' }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.huawei.agconnect:agcp:1.6.0.300'
    }
}
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://developer.huawei.com/repo/' }
    }
}
```
And apply the plugin in `app/build.gradle`: `apply plugin: 'com.huawei.agconnect'`

Then sync Gradle.

### React Native

Requirements: iOS 13.4+, Android minSdkVersion 23, compileSdk 35 (align compileSdk/targetSdk on the existing app, 35+). Built and tested against React Native 0.86 / Node 22.

> **React Native is on the v6 API** (same generation as native iOS / Android / Flutter — no longer grouped with Cordova). `react-native-purchasely 6.0.0-rc.2` pulls the 6.0.0-rc.2 native SDKs (iOS pod `Purchasely`, Android `io.purchasely:core`) and exposes the v6 TypeScript surface: `Purchasely.builder('key')…start()`, `Purchasely.presentation.placement(id).build()` → a `PLYPresentationRequest` (`preload()` / `display(transition?)`), and the per-action `Purchasely.interceptAction(kind, handler)` returning `'success' | 'failed' | 'notHandled'` strings. `../../references/react-native/integration.md` documents the v6 API.

**1. Install the core SDK:**
```bash
npm install react-native-purchasely
```

**2. Install the store dependency (required for Android):**
```bash
# Google Play — required if targeting Google Play Store
npm install @purchasely/react-native-purchasely-google
```

**3. Optional — video player for Android (videos in Screens):**
```bash
npm install @purchasely/react-native-purchasely-android-player
```

**Alternative Android stores** (instead of or in addition to Google Play):
```bash
npm install @purchasely/react-native-purchasely-amazon
npm install @purchasely/react-native-purchasely-huawei
```

**4. iOS pods:**
```bash
cd ios && pod install
```

**5. Android setup** — Android uses autolinking; just make sure `mavenCentral()` is present (default in modern projects) and `minSdkVersion` is at least 23 in `android/build.gradle`:
```groovy
buildscript {
    ext {
        minSdkVersion = 23    // SDK minimum (v6)
        // align compileSdk/targetSdk on the existing app (35+)
    }
}
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

**CRITICAL: All Purchasely packages must be at the exact same version.** Pin to the **exact** `6.0.0-rc.2` — never a caret / range, because it is a pre-release (see `../../references/sdk-versions.md`):
```json
"dependencies": {
  "react-native-purchasely": "6.0.0-rc.2",
  "@purchasely/react-native-purchasely-google": "6.0.0-rc.2",
  "@purchasely/react-native-purchasely-android-player": "6.0.0-rc.2"
}
```

> **Native dependency.** `react-native-purchasely 6.0.0-rc.2` pins the 6.0.0-rc.2 native SDKs — Android `io.purchasely:core` / `google-play` / `player` on **Maven Central**, iOS `Purchasely` on the **CocoaPods trunk** — so the project builds from the public repositories.

### Flutter

Requirements: iOS 13.4+, Android minSdk 23, compileSdk 36, targetSdk 35

> **Flutter is on the v6 API** (same generation as native iOS / Android — no longer grouped with React Native / Cordova). `purchasely_flutter 6.0.0-rc.1` pulls the 6.0.0-rc.1 native SDKs (iOS `Purchasely`, Android `io.purchasely:core`) and exposes the v6 Dart surface: `PurchaselyBuilder.apiKey(...).start()`, `PresentationBuilder` → `PresentationRequest` (`preload()` / `display([Transition])`), and the per-action `Purchasely.interceptAction(kind, handler)` returning an `InterceptResult`. `../../references/flutter/integration.md` and `../../references/flutter/migration-v6.md` document the v6 API.

**1. Install the core SDK:**
```bash
flutter pub add purchasely_flutter:6.0.0-rc.1
```

**2. Install the store dependency (required for Android):**
```bash
# Google Play — required if targeting Google Play Store
flutter pub add purchasely_google:6.0.0-rc.1
```

**3. Optional — video player for Android:**
```bash
flutter pub add purchasely_android_player:6.0.0-rc.1
```

**4. iOS pods:**
```bash
cd ios && pod install
```

**5. Android setup** — edit `android/build.gradle`:
```groovy
buildscript {
    ext {
        minSdkVersion = 23
        compileSdkVersion = 36
        targetSdkVersion = 35
    }
}
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

**CRITICAL: All Purchasely packages must be at the exact same version.** Pin to `6.0.0-rc.1` (see `../../references/sdk-versions.md`):
```yaml
dependencies:
  purchasely_flutter: 6.0.0-rc.1
  purchasely_google: 6.0.0-rc.1
  purchasely_android_player: 6.0.0-rc.1
```

> **Native dependency.** `purchasely_flutter 6.0.0-rc.1` pins the 6.0.0-rc.1 native SDKs — Android `io.purchasely:core` / `google-play` / `player` on **Maven Central**, iOS `Purchasely` on the **CocoaPods trunk** — so the project builds from the public repositories with no `mavenLocal()` and no development pod.

### Cordova

Requirements: iOS 13.4+, Android minSdk 23, compileSdk 36, targetSdk 35

> **Cordova is on the v6 API too** (same generation as native iOS / Android / Flutter / React Native). Unlike the builder-based v6 plugins, the **Cordova JavaScript surface stays method-based**: the native bridges were rewired to the 6.0 native SDKs behind the same `cordova.exec` actions. Most methods keep their v5 names and signatures (`fetchPresentation` / `presentPresentation[ForPlacement]`, `closePresentation()`, `userLogin` / `userLogout`, every `setUserAttributeWith*`), but there are **three breaking surfaces**: `Purchasely.start(options, success, error)` now takes a **single options object** (the v5 positional list is gone); the action interceptor is **per-action** `interceptAction(kind, handler)` returning a `Purchasely.InterceptResult` (`setPaywallActionInterceptor` + `onProcessAction` were removed; `PaywallAction` renamed `PresentationAction`); and the `isFullscreen` boolean became a **display mode** (`TransitionType`). Other v6 changes: default running mode is now **Observer** (set `runningMode: Purchasely.RunningMode.full` for purchase handling), deeplinks renamed `allowDeeplink` / `handleDeeplink` (+ new `allowCampaigns`), dismiss handler renamed `setDefaultPresentationDismissHandler`, `synchronize(success, error)` now reports completion, and `presentSubscriptions()` / `presentProductWithIdentifier()` / `presentPlanWithIdentifier()` / `showPresentation()` / `hidePresentation()` were **removed**. `../../references/cordova/integration.md` and `../../references/cordova/migration-v6.md` document the v6 API.

**1. Install the core plugin:**
```bash
cordova plugin add @purchasely/cordova-plugin-purchasely@6.0.0-rc.1
```

**2. Install the store dependency (required for Android):**
```bash
# Google Play — required if targeting Google Play Store
cordova plugin add @purchasely/cordova-plugin-purchasely-google@6.0.0-rc.1
```

**3. Android setup** — edit `android/build.gradle`:
```groovy
buildscript {
    ext {
        minSdkVersion = 23
        compileSdkVersion = 36
        targetSdkVersion = 35
    }
}
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

**CRITICAL: All Purchasely packages must be at the exact same version.** Pin to `6.0.0-rc.1` (see `../../references/sdk-versions.md`):
```json
"dependencies": {
  "@purchasely/cordova-plugin-purchasely": "6.0.0-rc.1",
  "@purchasely/cordova-plugin-purchasely-google": "6.0.0-rc.1"
}
```

**Action:** Actually edit the project files and run the install commands. Do not just show the commands — write the dependency into the appropriate file and execute the install. Ask the user about store choice and video support BEFORE installing.

---

## Step 2: Initialize the SDK

Add SDK initialization code to the app's entry point. The API key must come from the **Purchasely Console > App Settings**. Tell the user to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with their actual key.

Key configuration options to explain to the user:
- **Running mode**: `Full` (Purchasely handles the purchase flow end-to-end) or `Observer` (the app handles purchases, Purchasely only observes). ⚠️ **In SDK v6 the default running mode changed from Full to Observer on BOTH native iOS and Android.** The change is **silent** — existing code keeps compiling, but the SDK stops validating/processing purchases unless you set Full explicitly. If your app relies on Purchasely to process and validate purchases, you MUST call `.runningMode(.full)` (iOS) / `runningMode(PLYRunningMode.Full)` (Android). In Observer mode, presentations also no longer auto-close after purchase/restore.
- **StoreKit version** (iOS only): StoreKit 2 is recommended for new apps
- **Log level**: Use `DEBUG` during development, switch to `ERROR` for production
- **Android stores**: `GoogleStore` (default), `HuaweiStore`, `AmazonStore` — include only the stores relevant to the app

### iOS (Swift, SDK v6)

v6 replaces the single `Purchasely.start(withAPIKey:...)` call with a fluent builder. The recommended form is `async`:

```swift
import Purchasely

// In an async context reached from App.init() / didFinishLaunchingWithOptions
do {
    try await Purchasely
        .apiKey("YOUR_API_KEY")
        .runningMode(.full)            // ⚠️ REQUIRED for purchase handling — default is .observer in v6
        .storekitSettings(.storeKit2)  // StoreKit 2 recommended for new apps
        .logLevel(.debug)
        .start()
    print("Purchasely started")
} catch {
    print("Purchasely start error: \(error)")  // e.g. PLYError.configuration if the API key is empty
}
```

Completion-handler form (also Objective-C-compatible), when you cannot `await`:

```swift
Purchasely
    .apiKey("YOUR_API_KEY")
    .runningMode(.full)
    .start { error in
        if let error = error { print("Purchasely start error: \(error)") }
    }
```

Other chain modifiers: `.appUserId(_)`, `.environment(_)`, `.themeMode(_)`, `.allowDeeplink(_)`, `.allowCampaigns(_)`, `.handleDeeplink(_)` (cold-start deeplink). The old pre-`start` class funcs (`setEnvironment`, `setThemeMode`, `setShowPromotedInAppPurchasePaywall`, …) are deprecated in favor of these modifiers.

### Android (Kotlin, SDK v6)

```kotlin
import io.purchasely.ext.PLYRunningMode
import io.purchasely.ext.Purchasely
import io.purchasely.ext.LogLevel
import io.purchasely.google.GoogleStore

// In Application.onCreate()
Purchasely {
    context(applicationContext)
    apiKey("YOUR_API_KEY")
    logLevel(LogLevel.DEBUG)
    stores(listOf(GoogleStore()))  // Add HuaweiStore() or AmazonStore() if needed
    runningMode(PLYRunningMode.Full)
    allowDeeplink(true)
    allowCampaigns(true)
    onInitialized { error ->
        if (error == null) Log.d("PLY", "Started")
        else Log.e("PLY", "Start error", error)
    }
}
```

Only include the stores matching the dependencies added in Step 1. For example, if using Huawei: `listOf(GoogleStore(), HuaweiStore())`.

### React Native (TypeScript, SDK v6)

v6 replaces the single `Purchasely.start({...})` object call with a fluent builder that takes **string** options (not enums):

```typescript
import Purchasely from 'react-native-purchasely';

// In your app initialization (e.g., App.tsx useEffect or top-level async)
const started = await Purchasely.builder('YOUR_API_KEY')
  .appUserId('USER_ID')          // optional, defaults to anonymous
  .runningMode('full')           // ⚠️ REQUIRED for purchase handling — default is 'observer' in v6
  .logLevel('debug')             // 'debug' | 'info' | 'warn' | 'error'
  .stores(['google'])            // Android: 'google' | 'huawei' | 'amazon'
  .storekitVersion('storeKit2')  // iOS: 'storeKit2' (recommended) | 'storeKit1'
  .allowDeeplink(true)           // allow the SDK to open deeplinks (default false on RN)
  .allowCampaigns(true)          // optional campaign display gate (default true)
  .start();                      // Promise<boolean>
console.log('Purchasely started:', started);
```

`Purchasely.builder(...).start()` returns a `Promise<boolean>`; check it before using the SDK. ⚠️ The `runningMode` now defaults to `'observer'` in v6 (was Full) — you MUST pass `.runningMode('full')` for Purchasely to process and validate purchases. All options are plain strings: `runningMode` `'observer' | 'full'`, `logLevel` `'debug' | 'info' | 'warn' | 'error'`, `stores` `['google' | 'huawei' | 'amazon']`, `storekitVersion` `'storeKit1' | 'storeKit2'`.

### Flutter (Dart, SDK v6)

v6 replaces `Purchasely.start(...)` with a fluent `PurchaselyBuilder`:

```dart
import 'package:purchasely_flutter/purchasely_flutter.dart';

// In main() or initState()
final started = await PurchaselyBuilder.apiKey('YOUR_API_KEY')
    .appUserId('USER_ID')                        // optional, defaults to anonymous
    .runningMode(RunningMode.full)               // ⚠️ REQUIRED for purchase handling — default is RunningMode.observer in v6
    .logLevel(LogLevel.debug)                    // debug | info | warn | error
    .stores([PLYStore.google])                   // Android: PLYStore.google | huawei | amazon
    .storekitVersion(StorekitVersion.storeKit2)  // iOS: storeKit2 (recommended) | storeKit1
    .allowDeeplink(true)                         // allow the SDK to open deeplinks
    .allowCampaigns(true)                        // optional campaign display gate
    .start();
print('Purchasely started: $started');
```

`PurchaselyBuilder...start()` returns a `Future<bool>`; check it before using the SDK. ⚠️ The `runningMode` now defaults to `RunningMode.observer` in v6 (was Full) — you MUST pass `.runningMode(RunningMode.full)` for Purchasely to process and validate purchases. Enums: `RunningMode{observer, full}`, `LogLevel{debug, info, warn, error}`, `StorekitVersion{storeKit1, storeKit2}`.

### Cordova (JavaScript)

`Purchasely.start(...)` takes a **single options object** in v6 (the v5 positional argument list was removed), followed by `success` / `error` callbacks. Only `apiKey` is required. The v6 default running mode is now **Observer** — set `runningMode: Purchasely.RunningMode.full` for Purchasely to process and validate purchases.

```javascript
Purchasely.start(
  {
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    stores: [Purchasely.Store.google],        // Store.google | Store.huawei | Store.amazon
    storeKit1: false,                         // iOS only: false = StoreKit 2
    appUserId: null,                          // null for anonymous
    logLevel: Purchasely.LogLevel.DEBUG,
    runningMode: Purchasely.RunningMode.full, // v6 default is observer
    allowDeeplink: true,                      // optional
    allowCampaigns: true,                     // optional
  },
  (isConfigured) => console.log('Purchasely started', isConfigured),
  (error) => console.error('Purchasely start error:', error)
);
```

**Action:** Find the app's entry point file and write the initialization code into it. Add the necessary import statements at the top of the file.

---

## Step 3: Display a Presentation / Screen

Purchasely uses a **placement-based** approach. Placements are configured in the Purchasely Console and identified by a `placementId` (e.g., `"onboarding"`, `"settings"`, `"home_banner"`). Each placement can be associated with different Screens, audiences, and A/B tests — all managed remotely.

Native iOS, Android, Flutter and React Native are on the v6 builder API. iOS uses `PLYPresentationBuilder` (`.forPlacementId(_)` / `.forScreenId(_)`) → `.build().preload()`. Android uses the `PLYPresentation { ... }.preload()` builder. Flutter uses `PresentationBuilder` (`.placement(id)` / `.screen(id)` / `.defaultSource()`) → `.build()` to get a `PresentationRequest`, then `preload()` / `display([Transition])`. React Native uses `Purchasely.presentation.placement(id)` / `.screen(id)` / `.defaultSource()` (alias `.default()`) → `.build()` to get a `PLYPresentationRequest`, then `preload()` / `display(transition?)`. The legacy `fetchPresentation(...)` / `presentationView(...)` / VC-returning methods are removed in v6 native, Flutter v6 and React Native v6 — do **NOT** use them on these platforms.

> 💡 **Cordova v6 keeps a method-based presentation API:** use `fetchPresentation()` / `fetchPresentationForPlacement()` to inspect the returned `type`, then `presentPresentation(presentation, displayMode, ...)` (or `presentPresentationForPlacement`) with an explicit display mode. The v5 `isFullscreen` boolean argument became a display mode: `Purchasely.TransitionType.fullScreen`, `.modal`, `.drawer`, `.popin`, or a transition object. Keep the pre-fetch path for production so the app can skip `DEACTIVATED` / handle `CLIENT` before display.

The fetch returns a presentation with a `type` property. Handle each type:
- **NORMAL**: Display the paywall to the user
- **FALLBACK**: Display the paywall but log a warning (the primary paywall failed to load and this is a fallback)
- **DEACTIVATED**: Do NOT display anything — the placement has been deactivated in the Console
- **CLIENT**: The Console is requesting you show your own custom paywall (use the returned `presentationId` to decide which one)

### iOS (Swift, SDK v6)

```swift
// Build + preload, then display. preload() returns the loaded presentation
// (no extra network call on display).
let presentation = try await PLYPresentationBuilder
    .forPlacementId("PLACEMENT_ID")
    .build()
    .preload()

switch presentation.type {
case .normal, .fallback:
    // display(from:) handles Flows, transitions, and full-screen presentation automatically.
    presentation.display(from: self)
case .deactivated:
    // Placement is deactivated — do nothing or show your own UI
    break
case .client:
    // Show your own custom paywall
    break
@unknown default:
    break
}
```

Convenience shorthand when you don't need to inspect the type: `try await Purchasely.display(for: "PLACEMENT_ID", transition: nil)` (use `transition: .modal` for a modal). To dismiss programmatically later, call `Purchasely.closeAllScreens()`. The dismissal result is a `PLYPresentationOutcome` (`purchaseResult`, `plan`, `closeReason`); attach `.onDismissed { outcome in }` on the builder before `build()` if you need it.

### Android (Kotlin, SDK v6)

```kotlin
val presentation = PLYPresentation {
    placementId("PLACEMENT_ID")
    // Optional direct Console Screen lookup. Android keeps this name public.
    // screenId("SCREEN_ID")
    onPresented { loaded, error -> }
    onCloseRequested { }
}.preload()

when (presentation.type) {
    PLYPresentationType.NORMAL,
    PLYPresentationType.FALLBACK -> {
        presentation.display(activity) { outcome ->
            // Final dismissal result.
        }
    }
    PLYPresentationType.DEACTIVATED -> Unit
    PLYPresentationType.CLIENT -> {
        val screenId = presentation.screenId
        showYourOwnScreen(screenId)
    }
}
```

### React Native (TypeScript, SDK v6)

Build a `PLYPresentationRequest` with `Purchasely.presentation.placement(id).build()`, `preload()` it to inspect the `type`, then `display(transition?)` — which resolves at **dismiss** with a 5-field `PLYPresentationOutcome` (`presentation`, `purchaseResult`, `plan`, `closeReason`, `error`). The legacy `fetchPresentation` / `presentPresentation[ForPlacement]` methods are removed in React Native v6:

```typescript
import Purchasely, { PLYPresentationType } from 'react-native-purchasely';

const request = Purchasely.presentation.placement('PLACEMENT_ID').build();

const loaded = await request.preload(); // PLYLoadedPresentation

switch (loaded.type) {
  case PLYPresentationType.NORMAL:
  case PLYPresentationType.FALLBACK:
    const outcome = await request.display();
    if (outcome.purchaseResult === 'purchased' || outcome.purchaseResult === 'restored') {
      console.log('User purchased', outcome.plan?.name);
    } else {
      console.log('Dismissed without purchase:', outcome.closeReason);
    }
    break;
  case PLYPresentationType.DEACTIVATED:
    // Placement is deactivated — do nothing
    break;
  case PLYPresentationType.CLIENT:
    // Show your own custom paywall (use loaded.screenId / plan summaries)
    break;
}
```

`purchaseResult` is a string (`'purchased' | 'cancelled' | 'restored' | null`); `closeReason` is `'button' | 'backSystem' | 'programmatic' | null`. If you don't need to inspect the type first, you can build and display in one chain: `await Purchasely.presentation.placement('PLACEMENT_ID').build().display()`. `display(transition?)` takes an optional `PLYTransition` object (`{ type: 'fullScreen' | 'push' | 'modal' | 'drawer' | 'popin' | 'inlinePaywall', width?, height?, dismissible?, backgroundColors? }` where `width` / `height` are `{ type: 'pixel' | 'percentage', value }` dimensions — the v5 `heightPercentage` was removed). To dismiss programmatically later, hold the `PLYPresentationRequest` and call `request.close()` (also `.display()` / `.back()`).

### Flutter (Dart, SDK v6)

Build a `PresentationRequest` with `PresentationBuilder.placement(id).build()`, `preload()` it to inspect the `type`, then `display([Transition])` — which resolves at **dismiss** with a 5-field `PresentationOutcome` (`presentation`, `purchaseResult`, `plan`, `closeReason`, `error`). The legacy `fetchPresentation` / `presentPresentation[ForPlacement]` methods are removed in Flutter v6:

```dart
final request = PresentationBuilder.placement('PLACEMENT_ID').build();

final presentation = await request.preload();

switch (presentation.type) {
  case PresentationType.normal:
  case PresentationType.fallback:
    final outcome = await request.display(const Transition.fullScreen());
    if (outcome.purchaseResult == PurchaseResult.purchased ||
        outcome.purchaseResult == PurchaseResult.restored) {
      print('User purchased ${outcome.plan}');
    } else {
      print('Dismissed without purchase: ${outcome.closeReason}');
    }
    break;
  case PresentationType.deactivated:
    // Placement is deactivated — do nothing
    break;
  case PresentationType.client:
    // Show your own custom paywall (BYOS) — plan summaries are in presentation.plans
    break;
}
```

`purchaseResult` is the `PurchaseResult` enum (`purchased` / `restored` / `cancelled`). If you don't need to inspect the type first, you can build and display in one chain: `await PresentationBuilder.placement('PLACEMENT_ID').build().display(const Transition.fullScreen())`. To dismiss programmatically later, hold the loaded `Presentation` and call `presentation.close()` (also `.display()` / `.back()`).

### Cordova (JavaScript)

```javascript
Purchasely.fetchPresentationForPlacement(
  'PLACEMENT_ID',
  null, // contentId (optional)
  (presentation) => {
    switch (presentation.type) {
      case 'NORMAL':
      case 'FALLBACK':
        Purchasely.presentPresentation(
          presentation,
          Purchasely.TransitionType.fullScreen,
          null, // backgroundColor
          (result) => console.log('Presentation dismissed', result),
          (error) => console.error(error)
        );
        break;
      case 'DEACTIVATED':
        // Do nothing
        break;
      case 'CLIENT':
        // Show your own custom paywall
        break;
    }
  },
  (error) => console.error(error)
);
```

**Action:** Find the appropriate screen/view/component where the Presentation should be displayed (e.g., a premium button, settings screen, or onboarding flow) and add the display code. Ask the user which placement ID to use, or use `"onboarding"` as a sensible default.

### Advanced: Inline / Embedded Paywall (iOS & Android)

> **Only use this approach if the user explicitly needs to embed a paywall inside an existing container view** (e.g., an inline screen, a tab, or a custom layout). For standard full-screen and Flow presentations, `display()` above is the correct approach.

#### iOS — embed in a UIKit container view

```swift
// After build().preload(), for .normal or .fallback types only:
guard let paywallVC = presentation.controller else { return }

addChild(paywallVC)
paywallVC.view.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
containerView.addSubview(paywallVC.view)
NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
    paywallVC.view.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: containerView.topAnchor),
    paywallVC.view.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: containerView.bottomAnchor),
    paywallVC.view.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: containerView.leadingAnchor),
    paywallVC.view.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: containerView.trailingAnchor),
])
paywallVC.didMove(toParent: self)
```

#### iOS — embed in SwiftUI

In v6, read `presentation.swiftUIView` (renamed from the v5 `controller.PresentationView`; the name disambiguates from `UIKit.UIView`). It is `nil` for `.deactivated` presentations.

```swift
// `presentation` is the loaded PLYPresentation (.normal / .fallback)
if let view = presentation.swiftUIView {
    view
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
}
```

#### Android — option A: embed as a View

```kotlin
val presentationView = presentation.buildView(this) { outcome ->
    // Handle embedded Presentation result.
}
containerViewGroup.addView(presentationView)
```

#### Android — option B: embed as a Fragment

```kotlin
val fragment = presentation.getFragment { outcome ->
    // Handle embedded Presentation result.
}
supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()
    .replace(R.id.your_container, fragment)
    .commitAllowingStateLoss()
```

#### Android — option C: embed in Compose

There is no Compose-specific artifact or composable in v6. Wrap the Android View returned by `buildView(...)` with `AndroidView`:

```kotlin
AndroidView(
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
    factory = { context ->
        presentation.buildView(context) { outcome ->
            // Handle embedded Presentation result.
        }
    }
)
```

> Note: Use embedded APIs only for inline use cases where the app owns the UI hierarchy.

---

## Step 4: Handle Paywall Actions with the Action Interceptor

The **Paywall Actions Interceptor** lets you intercept user actions on the paywall before they are processed. This is essential for:
- **LOGIN**: Prompt the user to log in when they tap a login-required button on the paywall
- **NAVIGATE**: Handle custom navigation actions (e.g., deep links to terms of service)
- **PURCHASE**: Add custom logic before/after a purchase (in Full mode, the SDK handles the purchase itself)
- **RESTORE**: Add custom logic around restoration
- **CLOSE**: Control what happens when the user dismisses the paywall

**On native iOS, Android, Flutter, React Native and Cordova (v6)**, the interceptor is **per-action**: register one handler per action and return a result — `.success` / `success` / `'success'` (you handled it, the SDK chains the next action), `.failed` / `failed` / `'failed'` (you tried and failed, remaining actions are skipped), or `.notHandled` / `notHandled` / `'notHandled'` (the SDK executes the action itself). On native iOS/Android the result type is `PLYInterceptResult`; on Flutter it is `InterceptResult`; on React Native the handler returns the **string** `'success' | 'failed' | 'notHandled'`; on Cordova it returns — or resolves to — a `Purchasely.InterceptResult`. There is no `proceed`/`processAction` callback in the v6 interceptors. The v5 `setPaywallActionInterceptor` / `setPaywallActionInterceptorCallback` + `onProcessAction(...)` APIs are removed on all v6 platforms.

### iOS (Swift, SDK v6)

```swift
// async form
Purchasely.interceptAction(.login) { info, params in
    let loggedIn = await self.presentLogin()
    if loggedIn { Purchasely.userLogin(with: "USER_ID") }
    return loggedIn ? .success : .notHandled
}

Purchasely.interceptAction(.navigate) { info, params in
    if let urlString = params?.url, let url = URL(string: urlString) {
        await UIApplication.shared.open(url)
    }
    return .success
}

// In Full mode, let Purchasely run the purchase itself:
Purchasely.interceptAction(.purchase) { info, params in
    return .notHandled
}
```

A completion-based form is also available for Objective-C / non-async call sites:

```swift
Purchasely.interceptAction(.login) { info, params, completion in
    self.presentLogin { loggedIn in
        completion(loggedIn ? .success : .notHandled)
    }
}
```

`info` is a `PLYInterceptorInfo` (renamed from v5 `PLYPresentationInfo`): `info.presentation?.id`, `?.placementId`, `?.audienceId`, `?.abTestId`, `info.contentId`, `info.controller`.

### Android (Kotlin, SDK v6)

```kotlin
Purchasely.interceptAction<PLYPresentationAction.Login> { _, _ ->
    showLoginScreen()
    PLYInterceptResult.SUCCESS
}

Purchasely.interceptAction<PLYPresentationAction.Navigate> { _, navigate ->
    startActivity(Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, navigate.url))
    PLYInterceptResult.SUCCESS
}

Purchasely.interceptAction<PLYPresentationAction.Purchase> { _, _ ->
    PLYInterceptResult.NOT_HANDLED // let Purchasely handle it in Full mode
}
```

The reified `interceptAction<T> { … }` lambda is `suspend` and **returns** the `PLYInterceptResult`.
When your call site is not a coroutine, use the `Class`-based overload (`::class.java`) and return
the result later via the `result` lambda:

```kotlin
Purchasely.interceptAction(PLYPresentationAction.Purchase::class.java) { _, action, result ->
    val purchase = action as PLYPresentationAction.Purchase   // cast yourself
    result(PLYInterceptResult.NOT_HANDLED)   // call exactly once, may be deferred
}
```

Android v6 returns `PLYInterceptResult.SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, or `NOT_HANDLED`; there is no `processAction` callback in the new native Android interceptor.

### Android (Java, SDK v6)

Java cannot use the reified `interceptAction<T>` — use the `Class`-based overload, cast the action,
and resolve via `result.invoke(...)`:

```java
Purchasely.interceptAction(PLYPresentationAction.Login.class, (info, action, result) ->
    result.invoke(PLYInterceptResult.NOT_HANDLED));

Purchasely.interceptAction(PLYPresentationAction.Purchase.class, (info, action, result) -> {
    PLYPresentationAction.Purchase purchase = (PLYPresentationAction.Purchase) action;
    // ... optionally async; call result exactly once:
    result.invoke(PLYInterceptResult.NOT_HANDLED);
});
```

### React Native (TypeScript, SDK v6)

Register **one handler per action kind** with `Purchasely.interceptAction(kind, handler)`. The async handler receives `(info, payload)` and returns the **string** `'success' | 'failed' | 'notHandled'` — there is no `onProcessAction`. Use `Purchasely.removeActionInterceptor(kind)` / `Purchasely.removeAllActionInterceptors()` to tear them down.

```typescript
import { Linking } from 'react-native';

Purchasely.interceptAction('login', async (info, payload) => {
  // Navigate to your login screen, then:
  Purchasely.userLogin('USER_ID');
  return 'success';
});

Purchasely.interceptAction('navigate', async (info, payload) => {
  if (payload?.kind === 'navigate' && payload.url) {
    Linking.openURL(payload.url);
    return 'success';
  }
  return 'notHandled';
});

// In Full mode, let Purchasely run the purchase itself:
Purchasely.interceptAction('purchase', async (info, payload) => 'notHandled');
```

Action kinds: `'close'`, `'closeAll'`, `'login'`, `'navigate'`, `'purchase'`, `'restore'`, `'openPresentation'`, `'openPlacement'`, `'promoCode'`, `'webCheckout'`. Each kind carries a typed payload (`payload.kind === 'navigate'` exposes `url`, `'purchase'` exposes `plan`, …); payload-less kinds (`'login'`, `'restore'`, `'promoCode'`) carry no extra fields.

### Flutter (Dart, SDK v6)

Register **one handler per action kind** with `Purchasely.interceptAction(PresentationActionKind.kind, handler)`. The async handler receives a typed payload and returns an `InterceptResult` (`success` / `failed` / `notHandled`) — there is no `onProcessAction`. Use `removeInterceptor(kind)` / `removeAllInterceptors()` to tear them down.

```dart
await Purchasely.interceptAction(
  PresentationActionKind.login,
  (info, payload) async {
    // Navigate to your login screen, then:
    Purchasely.userLogin('USER_ID');
    return InterceptResult.success;
  },
);

await Purchasely.interceptAction(
  PresentationActionKind.navigate,
  (info, payload) async {
    if (payload is NavigatePayload && payload.url != null) {
      launchUrl(Uri.parse(payload.url!));
      return InterceptResult.success;
    }
    return InterceptResult.notHandled;
  },
);

// In Full mode, let Purchasely run the purchase itself:
await Purchasely.interceptAction(
  PresentationActionKind.purchase,
  (info, payload) async => InterceptResult.notHandled,
);
```

Action kinds (`PresentationActionKind`): `close`, `closeAll`, `login`, `navigate`, `purchase`, `restore`, `openPresentation`, `openPlacement`, `promoCode`, `webCheckout`. Each kind has a typed payload (`NavigatePayload`, `PurchasePayload`, `OpenPresentationPayload`, `OpenPlacementPayload`, `WebCheckoutPayload`, …); payload-less kinds (`login`, `restore`, `promoCode`) carry no extra fields. `PurchasePayload` exposes real Dart objects: `plan` is a `PLYPlan`, `subscriptionOffer` is a nullable `PLYSubscriptionOffer`, and `offer` is a nullable `PLYPromoOffer`.

### Cordova (JavaScript)

Cordova v6 intercepts actions **per kind** with `interceptAction(kind, handler)` (the v5 single `setPaywallActionInterceptor` + `onProcessAction` were removed). The handler receives `(info, parameters)` and returns — or resolves to — a `Purchasely.InterceptResult` (`success` / `failed` / `notHandled`). Action kinds are on `Purchasely.PresentationAction` (the `PaywallAction` constant was renamed).

```javascript
Purchasely.interceptAction(Purchasely.PresentationAction.login, function(info, parameters) {
  return new Promise(function(resolve) {
    showLogin(function(userId) {
      Purchasely.userLogin(userId, function() {});
      resolve(Purchasely.InterceptResult.success);
    }, function() {
      resolve(Purchasely.InterceptResult.notHandled);
    });
  });
});

Purchasely.interceptAction(Purchasely.PresentationAction.navigate, function(info, parameters) {
  if (parameters && parameters.url) {
    window.open(parameters.url, '_system');
    return Purchasely.InterceptResult.success;
  }
  return Purchasely.InterceptResult.notHandled;
});

// In Full mode, let Purchasely run the purchase itself:
Purchasely.interceptAction(Purchasely.PresentationAction.purchase, function(info, parameters) {
  return Purchasely.InterceptResult.notHandled;
});
```

Action kinds (`Purchasely.PresentationAction`): `close`, `close_all`, `login`, `navigate`, `purchase`, `restore`, `open_presentation`, `open_placement`, `promo_code`, `web_checkout`.

**Action:** Register action interceptors right after SDK initialization. At minimum, handle the `login` action if the paywall can request authentication; register a handler only for the kinds you need. Handlers may return a `Promise` for async work.

---

## Step 5: User Management

After the user authenticates in the app, call `userLogin` so Purchasely can associate purchases with the user. On sign out, call `userLogout`.

> **Ordering matters.** Call `userLogin` **before** any subscription gating or `fetchPresentation` call that depends on audience targeting — otherwise the SDK evaluates audience rules against the anonymous user. Also call `synchronize()` on foreground (`applicationDidBecomeActive` / `onResume` / `AppState 'active'`) to refresh state when renewals or cancellations happened in the background. Full per-platform guidance in `../../references/concepts/user-identity.md` (anonymous→logged-in merge, sign-out caveats, code samples).

### iOS
```swift
Purchasely.userLogin(with: "USER_ID")
Purchasely.userLogout()
```

### Android
```kotlin
Purchasely.userLogin("USER_ID")
Purchasely.userLogout()
```

### React Native
```typescript
Purchasely.userLogin('USER_ID');
Purchasely.userLogout();
```

### Flutter
```dart
Purchasely.userLogin('USER_ID');
Purchasely.userLogout();
```

### Cordova
```javascript
Purchasely.userLogin('USER_ID');
Purchasely.userLogout();
```

Optionally, set **user attributes** for audience segmentation:
```
Purchasely.setUserAttribute("age", 28)
Purchasely.setUserAttribute("gender", "male")
```

**Action:** Find the app's authentication flow (login/signup success handler and logout handler) and add the `userLogin`/`userLogout` calls. If no auth flow exists, add a TODO comment where it should go.

---

## Step 5b: Restore Purchases

A user can lose access to their subscription on a new device, after a reinstall, or after switching account on the store. Apple **requires** a "Restore Purchases" entry point for App Store review (Guideline 3.1.1) — Google does not require but strongly recommends one.

> ⚠️ **Check the Purchasely paywall first.** Most Purchasely Screens built with the Screen Composer already include a "Restore" button — the Console operator can toggle it on. If it's already there on every relevant paywall, **do not add a duplicate** in app code; clarify the situation with the customer / Console operator and surface the existing button. Only add an app-side restore button when (a) the Purchasely Screen does **not** have one, **and** (b) you need a Restore action outside the paywall (e.g. in app Settings — recommended for Apple review).

If you do add it, wire it to `Purchasely.restoreAllProducts(...)`. See `../../references/concepts/subscription-checks.md` for the full per-platform code samples and the Observer-mode variant (intercept the `RESTORE` paywall action, run your own restore, call `Purchasely.synchronize()` + `proceed(true)`).

**Action:** Search the project for a Settings screen / Account screen. If one exists and the Purchasely paywalls don't already provide restore, add a "Restore Purchases" button there with the SDK call. If the Purchasely paywalls do provide restore, leave the in-paywall button as the canonical entry point and tell the user.

---

## Step 5c: Manage Subscription Entry Point

App Store and Play Store both require an in-app entry point to **manage the subscription** (cancel, upgrade, downgrade). This is a native OS page — your app only opens the right deeplink. See `../../references/concepts/subscription-management.md` for the per-platform helpers:

- iOS 15+: `AppStore.showManageSubscriptions(in: scene)` (in-app sheet)
- iOS legacy / fallback: open `https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions`
- Android: open `https://play.google.com/store/account/subscriptions?sku=<sku>&package=<pkg>` (per-product) or the general subscriptions URL

**Action:** Add a "Manage subscription" link in the Settings / Account screen, visible only to active subscribers (gate on `userSubscriptions`).

---

## Step 6: Verify the Integration

After completing the integration, verify it works:

1. **Run the Completion Build Gate above** — prove there are no compilation errors from the SDK import before moving on
2. **Run the app when a device/simulator is available** — confirm it launches after the build
3. **Check the logs** — look for `"Purchasely SDK initialized"` or similar success message in the debug console
4. **Display a test paywall** — trigger the paywall display and confirm the presentation loads from the Purchasely Console
5. **Verify the action interceptor** — tap buttons on the paywall and confirm your interceptor logs fire
6. **Check the Purchasely Console** — go to Live > Events to see if the SDK is sending events from the device

**Action:** Build the app, fix any build errors, rerun the build and relevant tests, then run the app when possible. Read the console output to confirm successful initialization before reporting success to the user.

---

## Step 7: Architecture Choice (Ask the User)

Before finishing, ask the user:

> **How would you like to organize the SDK integration?**
>
> **A) Direct integration** — Call Purchasely SDK methods directly from your app code. Simpler to set up, fine for small projects.
>
> **B) Wrapper pattern (recommended for larger projects)** — Route all Purchasely SDK calls through a single dedicated class. Better for testability and SDK isolation. The class name is up to you (`PurchaselyWrapper`, `PurchaselyService`, `IAPManager`, … any name works). See `../../references/architecture-patterns.md`.

If the user chooses **B**, help them:
1. Create a single class (e.g. `PurchaselyWrapper`) that owns every call into `Purchasely.*`
2. Move init, interceptor, and events into that class
3. Define type-safe result types (`FetchResult`, `DisplayResult`)
4. If Observer mode: decouple the native billing service with reactive patterns (SharedFlow / Combine) so it has zero SDK imports

If the user chooses **A**, the integration from Steps 1-6 is already complete. Do NOT add a wrapper.

See `../../references/architecture-patterns.md` for detailed architecture diagrams and implementation guidance.

---

## Important Notes

- In **Full mode**, the SDK handles the entire purchase flow. You do not need to call StoreKit/Play Billing APIs yourself.
- In **Observer mode**, you handle purchases yourself and must call `Purchasely.synchronize()` after each successful purchase so Purchasely can track it.
- Always test with a sandbox/test account before going to production.
- Switch `logLevel` to `ERROR` (or remove the parameter) before releasing to production.
- The SDK supports multiple stores on Android (Google, Huawei, Amazon). Only include the stores your app actually publishes on.

---

## Step 8: Observer Mode — Post-Purchase Flow (All Platforms)

> **Universal pattern.** Applies to iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Cordova. The full cross-platform reference is `../../references/concepts/observer-mode-post-purchase.md` — load it when you need the per-language code samples. The summary below covers the rules and the two native idioms.

**Only relevant if you initialized in `Observer` / `.observer` / `PAYWALL_OBSERVER` mode.** In Full mode, the SDK handles dismissal automatically (it appends an implicit `close_all` after a lone purchase/restore). **Observer mode does NOT auto-close** after a purchase/restore — your app dismisses the paywall itself.

When the interceptor receives a `PURCHASE` action in Observer mode, you run the native billing flow yourself. After it succeeds:

- **Native iOS/Android (v6):** intercept the `.purchase` action, run your billing flow, call **`Purchasely.synchronize()`** to upload the receipt, then **return `PLYInterceptResult.SUCCESS`** (`.success` on iOS) from the interceptor. (There is no `proceed`/`processAction` callback in the v6 native interceptor; returning `.success` is the v6 equivalent of the old `processAction(false)`.) Because Observer mode does not auto-close, **dismiss the paywall yourself with `Purchasely.closeAllScreens()` after the interceptor has resolved** (from your billing-result handler) — unless you wire a `close` / `close_all` action on the button in the Console. Do **not** call `closeAllScreens()` inside the interceptor closure before returning the result — that races the SDK.
- **Flutter (v6):** intercept the `.purchase` action with `Purchasely.interceptAction(PresentationActionKind.purchase, ...)`, run your billing flow, `await Purchasely.synchronize()` to upload the receipt, then **return `InterceptResult.success`** from the handler. There is no `onProcessAction`; returning `.success` is the v6 equivalent of `processAction(false)`. Observer mode does not auto-close, so dismiss the paywall yourself with `presentation.close()` on the loaded `Presentation` **after** the handler resolves.
- **React Native (v6):** intercept the `'purchase'` action with `Purchasely.interceptAction('purchase', ...)`, run your billing flow, `await Purchasely.synchronize()` to upload the receipt, then **return `'success'`** from the handler. There is no `onProcessAction`; returning `'success'` is the v6 equivalent of `processAction(false)`. Observer mode does not auto-close, so dismiss the paywall yourself with `request.close()` on the held `PresentationRequest` **after** the handler resolves.
- **Cordova (v6):** intercept the `purchase` action with `Purchasely.interceptAction(Purchasely.PresentationAction.purchase, handler)`, run your billing flow, call `Purchasely.synchronize(success, error)` to upload the receipt, then **return (or resolve to) `Purchasely.InterceptResult.success`** from the handler. There is no `onProcessAction`; returning `.success` tells the SDK you handled the action. Observer mode does not auto-close, so dismiss with `Purchasely.closePresentation()` after the handler resolves.

**The order matters:** the SDK must learn the action was handled BEFORE the paywall tears down; reversing it leaves the paywall in an inconsistent state. On native v6, return the result first, then dismiss with `closeAllScreens()` from your billing-result handler — don't call it inside the interceptor closure.

### SDK version requirements for dismissal

| Platform | Minimum version |
|----------|-----------------|
| iOS (native) | **6.0.0-rc.1** — return `.success`, then call `Purchasely.closeAllScreens()` after the interceptor resolves (Observer mode does not auto-close; or wire a Console `close` action). It is `@MainActor`-isolated. Wrap in `Task { @MainActor in Purchasely.closeAllScreens() }` when called from a non-isolated synchronous context. |
| Android (native) | **6.0.0-rc.1** — return `PLYInterceptResult.SUCCESS`, then call `Purchasely.closeAllScreens()` after the interceptor resolves (Observer mode does not auto-close; or wire a Console `close` action). No threading constraint. |
| Flutter | **6.0.0-rc.1** — return `InterceptResult.success`, then dismiss with `presentation.close()` on the loaded `Presentation` after the handler resolves (Observer mode does not auto-close; or wire a Console `close` action). There is no `closePresentation()` in Flutter v6. |
| React Native | **6.0.0-rc.2** — return `'success'`, then dismiss with `request.close()` on the held `PresentationRequest` after the handler resolves (Observer mode does not auto-close; or wire a Console `close` action). There is no `closePresentation()` / `closeAllScreens()` in React Native v6. |
| Cordova | **6.0.0-rc.1** — return `Purchasely.InterceptResult.success`, then dismiss with `Purchasely.closePresentation()` in the public JS bridge after the handler resolves (method-based; no `closeAllScreens()` on the JS side). |

Full version list: `../../references/sdk-versions.md`.

> On native iOS/Android in Observer mode, dismiss the presentation yourself with `closeAllScreens()` (not `closeDisplayedPresentation()`) after resolving the interceptor — the SDK only auto-appends `close_all` in Full mode. `closeAllScreens()` correctly tears down Flow paywalls with multiple steps. On Flutter v6, dismiss with `presentation.close()` on the loaded `Presentation` after the handler resolves. On React Native v6, dismiss with `request.close()` on the held `PresentationRequest` after the handler resolves (there is no `closePresentation()` / `closeAllScreens()` in React Native v6). On Cordova v6, use the public bridge `closePresentation()` after resolving the handler.

### iOS Observer-mode post-purchase (v6)

In v6 the `.purchase` interceptor returns a `PLYInterceptResult`. Run your billing flow, `synchronize()`, then return `.success`. Observer mode does not auto-close, so dismiss the paywall with `Purchasely.closeAllScreens()` **after** the interceptor returns — or wire a `close` action in the Console:

```swift
Purchasely.interceptAction(.purchase) { info, params in
    let bought = await self.runMyBillingFlow()
    guard bought else { return .failed }
    await self.synchronizeReceipt()       // upload receipt; await if you chain a follow-up placement
    // Observer mode does not auto-close. Schedule the dismissal to run AFTER this interceptor
    // closure has returned its result — calling closeAllScreens() inline (before the return)
    // races the SDK. Skip this entirely if a `close` action is configured on the button in the Console.
    Task { @MainActor in Purchasely.closeAllScreens() }
    return .success                        // v6 equivalent of processAction(false)
}

@MainActor
private func synchronizeReceipt() async {
    await withCheckedContinuation { (cont: CheckedContinuation<Void, Never>) in
        Purchasely.synchronize(
            success: { cont.resume() },
            failure: { _ in cont.resume() }
        )
    }
}
```

### Android Observer-mode post-purchase (v6)

```kotlin
Purchasely.interceptAction<PLYPresentationAction.Purchase> { _, purchase ->
    val bought = runMyBillingFlow(purchase.plan)
    if (!bought) return@interceptAction PLYInterceptResult.FAILED
    // synchronize() refreshes the subscriptions cache. Observer mode does not auto-close, so
    // dismiss from onSuccess — which runs after this interceptor has resolved. Skip closeAllScreens()
    // if a `close` action is configured on the button in the Console.
    Purchasely.synchronize(
        onSuccess = { Purchasely.closeAllScreens() },
        onError = { /* surface failure */ }
    )
    PLYInterceptResult.SUCCESS       // v6 equivalent of processAction(false); resolve, then dismiss above
}
```

> On Android, `Purchasely.synchronize(onSuccess = { plan -> }, onError = { error -> })` accepts optional callbacks and refreshes the subscriptions cache before `onSuccess`. To bridge a blocking billing flow inside a suspend interceptor, use `suspendCancellableCoroutine { ... }`.

### Flutter Observer-mode post-purchase (v6)

In v6 the `.purchase` interceptor returns an `InterceptResult`. Handle the `purchase` action with `Purchasely.interceptAction(...)`, run your own billing flow, `await Purchasely.synchronize()` (now awaitable — it resolves on completion and throws a `PlatformException` on failure), return `InterceptResult.success`, then dismiss the loaded `Presentation` with `presentation.close()` after the handler resolves (Observer mode does not auto-close):

```dart
await Purchasely.interceptAction(
  PresentationActionKind.purchase,
  (info, payload) async {
    if (payload is! PurchasePayload) return InterceptResult.notHandled;
    final ok = await MyPurchaseSystem.purchase(payload.plan.vendorId);
    if (!ok) return InterceptResult.failed;
    try {
      await Purchasely.synchronize();  // upload the receipt to Purchasely
    } on PlatformException {
      // surface failure
      return InterceptResult.failed;
    }
    return InterceptResult.success;    // v6 equivalent of processAction(false)
  },
);

// Called after the interceptor has resolved (Observer mode does not auto-close).
// Skip this if a `close` action is configured on the button in the Console.
Future<void> onPurchaseSuccess(Presentation presentation) async {
  await presentation.close();
}
```

### React Native Observer-mode post-purchase (v6)

In v6 the `'purchase'` interceptor returns a **string** result. Handle the `'purchase'` action with `Purchasely.interceptAction(...)`, run your own billing flow, `await Purchasely.synchronize()` (now awaitable — it resolves on completion and rejects on failure), return `'success'`, then dismiss the held `PresentationRequest` with `request.close()` after the handler resolves (Observer mode does not auto-close):

```ts
Purchasely.interceptAction('purchase', async (info, payload) => {
  if (payload?.kind !== 'purchase') return 'notHandled';
  const ok = await MyPurchaseSystem.purchase(payload.plan.productId);
  if (!ok) return 'failed';
  try {
    await Purchasely.synchronize();  // upload the receipt to Purchasely
  } catch (e) {
    // surface failure
    return 'failed';
  }
  return 'success';                  // v6 equivalent of processAction(false)
});

// Called after the interceptor has resolved (Observer mode does not auto-close).
// `request` is the held PresentationRequest. Skip this if a `close` action is
// configured on the button in the Console.
async function onPurchaseSuccess(request) {
  await request.close();
}
```

### Cordova Observer-mode post-purchase (v6)

In v6 the Cordova `purchase` interceptor returns a `Purchasely.InterceptResult`. Run your billing flow, call `synchronize(success, error)`, resolve with `Purchasely.InterceptResult.success`, then close the presentation after the handler has resolved. There is no `onProcessAction` in Cordova v6.

**Cordova (JavaScript)**

```js
Purchasely.interceptAction(Purchasely.PresentationAction.purchase, function(info, parameters) {
  return MyPurchaseSystem.purchase(parameters.plan).then(function(ok) {
    if (!ok) return Purchasely.InterceptResult.failed;

    return new Promise(function(resolve) {
      Purchasely.synchronize(
        function() { resolve(Purchasely.InterceptResult.success); },
        function() { resolve(Purchasely.InterceptResult.failed); }
      );
    });
  });
});

function onPurchaseSuccess() {
  Purchasely.closePresentation(); // after the interceptor resolved
}
```

For chained follow-up placements on cross-platform SDKs, see `../../references/concepts/observer-mode-post-purchase.md`.

### Optional: Chain a Follow-up Placement After Purchase

Some apps display a follow-up paywall after a successful purchase — a thank-you screen, a premium feature tour, a one-tap upsell. This is **not part of the SDK contract**: it's just another presentation built for whatever placement ID you've configured on the Console (pick your own, e.g. `"post_purchase"`, `"thank_you"`, `"premium_welcome"`).

If the chained placement's audience targets subscribers, **`synchronize()` must complete first** — otherwise the build resolves against stale state and may return a deactivated/fallback presentation. On iOS, that's why the `synchronizeReceipt()` await above matters; on Android, fire-and-forget `synchronize()` is usually fast enough.

```swift
// iOS — after closeAllScreens() above
@MainActor
private func showPostPurchaseScreen() async {
    guard let presentation = try? await PLYPresentationBuilder
        .forPlacementId("YOUR_POST_PURCHASE_PLACEMENT_ID")
        .build()
        .preload(),
        presentation.type == .normal || presentation.type == .fallback,
        let topVC = UIApplication.shared.topViewController()
    else { return }
    presentation.display(from: topVC)
}
```

```kotlin
// Android — after closeAllScreens() above
private fun showPostPurchaseScreen(activity: Activity) {
    PLYPresentation {
        placementId("YOUR_POST_PURCHASE_PLACEMENT_ID")
    }.preload { loaded, error ->
        if (error != null || loaded == null) return@preload
        when (loaded.type) {
            PLYPresentationType.NORMAL,
            PLYPresentationType.FALLBACK -> loaded.display(activity)
            else -> {}
        }
    }
}
```

**Naming gotcha:** the placement ID string must match the Console exactly — a typo silently returns a deactivated presentation.

## Step 9: Beyond the Basics — Recommended Next Steps

Once Steps 1-8 are in place and verified, walk the user through the **optional but high-value** add-ons. Each is documented in a dedicated concept reference so you can load only what's relevant.

| Feature | When to suggest | Reference |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Preload paywalls** — call `fetchPresentation` ahead of the display (e.g. on app launch, on screen mount) and keep the result for instant display. Avoids the FlowsManager step accumulation on every re-fetch. | Any production integration — significant perceived-perf win | `../../references/concepts/presentation-cache.md` |
| **Campaigns** — schedule paywalls (Black Friday, anniversary), centralise display rules across placements, trigger paywalls on events. Requires SDK ≥ 5.1.0 and `allowDeeplink(true)` (v6 name on native, Flutter, React Native, and Cordova; default is `true` on native / Flutter / Cordova v6 but `false` on React Native, and Android auto-intercepts deeplinks with zero code). | Any team running marketing operations | `../../references/concepts/campaigns.md` |
| **Promotional offers & promo codes** — retain / win back subscribers with Apple promotional offers, Google developer-determined offers, App Store / Play Store offer codes. Requires SDK ≥ 4.0.0. | Apps with churn, seasonal promos, win-back funnels | `../../references/concepts/promotional-offers.md` |
| **Analytics integration** — forward Purchasely UI events to Firebase / Amplitude / AppsFlyer (client-side) and subscription lifecycle events via 3rd-party integrations / webhooks (server-side, recommended). | Any team with an analytics stack — recommend a single analytics wrapper / manager to centralise the routing | `../../references/concepts/analytics-integration.md` |
| **Subscription gating + restore** — gate premium content via `userSubscriptions`, restore purchases from Settings | Any app with premium features | `../../references/concepts/subscription-checks.md` |
| **Audience attributes + GDPR consent** — target users with `setUserAttribute`, gate event flow on consent | Apps with marketing audiences or EU users | `../../references/concepts/user-attributes-targeting.md` |
| **Bring Your Own Screen (BYOS)** — embed a native screen (login, custom form, legacy paywall A/B variant) inside a Purchasely Flow with its own connections / `executeConnection(...)` chaining. **iOS + Android only, SDK ≥ 5.6.0.** | Teams that need a native login step in a Flow, or want to A/B their existing paywall against a Composer version | `../../references/concepts/byos.md` |
| **Lottie animations** — render Composer Lottie blocks by adding Airbnb Lottie plus the Purchasely bridge/interface in native host projects. | Any Screen uses Lottie JSON animations, including React Native / Flutter / Cordova apps through their iOS/Android hosts | `../../references/concepts/lottie-animations.md` |
| **Chain multiple actions on a single button** — configure `purchase + open_screen` / `purchase + open_placement` / `purchase + deeplink` in the Screen Composer. Without a second action, the default is *close in Full mode, stay open in Observer mode*. | Any team wiring post-purchase upsells, thank-you screens, or onboarding completion | `../../references/concepts/paywall-actions.md` § Chaining multiple actions |

Pick the ones the user's roadmap actually needs — don't push all six on day one.

## Step 10: Diagnostic Markers

Add app-side log markers around the key Purchasely decision points — they make every future bug 10× faster to diagnose. The SDK already emits `[Purchasely]` lines; add an app-side prefix (e.g. `[YourApp]`) at:

- After `synchronize()` completes (success or failure)
- Before each platform dismiss call (`closeAllScreens()` on native iOS/Android v6, `presentation.close()` on Flutter v6, `request.close()` on React Native v6, `closePresentation()` on Cordova v6)
- When a presentation finishes loading (native + Flutter + React Native v6: in the builder `onPresented` / `onLoaded` / `.preload()` result — placement, type, error; Cordova v6: in the `fetchPresentation` completion)
- When chaining a follow-up placement (and what it resolves to)

Mirror the SDK's analytics events via `PLYEventDelegate` (iOS) / `EventListener` (Android) with the full property bag — that way, a single `grep -E "\[Purchasely\]|\[YourApp\]"` over the failing run reveals exactly what the SDK did and why. See `../../references/troubleshooting/common-issues.md` §0 for the full event taxonomy and annotated traces.
