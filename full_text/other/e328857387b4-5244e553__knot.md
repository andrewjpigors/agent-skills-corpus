name: knot
description: Use when working in a knot-tracked project, signaled by `.knot.edn` or `.tickets/` at any ancestor of cwd, ids matching `<prefix>-01<base32>`, or intent like "what's next?", "what's blocked?", "list tickets", "show the backlog", "any pending bugs?", "what's open?", "what's tagged <x>?", "my tickets", "show me <id>", "track this", "open a ticket", "start <id>", "close this", "ship it", "add a note", or an autonomous agent told to pick up unblocked work. Do NOT use for hosted trackers (GitHub Issues, Linear, Jira, Basecamp, Asana, Trello) or for ids prefixed with hosted-tracker shortcodes (`GH-1234`, `ENG-1234`, `LIN-1234`, `JIRA-PROJ-1234`) — those have their own tools.

# knot — file-based CLI ticket tracker

knot stores each ticket as a markdown file with YAML frontmatter under `.tickets/`. Closed tickets auto-move to
`.tickets/archive/`. Configuration lives in `.knot.edn` at the repo root (or any ancestor — knot walks up). Verify cwd
is inside the project root before running commands; running from a parent directory may quietly pick up a different knot
project.

If `.knot.edn` and `.tickets/` are both absent and the user wants to start tracking work with knot, run `knot init`.
Don't init without an explicit signal — the user may already use a different tracker.

## The one rule: use the CLI

**Read tickets only via** `knot show` / `knot list` / `knot ready` / `knot blocked` / `knot closed` / `knot prime`.

**Write tickets only via** `knot create` / `knot start` / `knot status` / `knot close` / `knot reopen` / `knot delete` / `knot add-note` / `knot edit` / `knot update` / `knot dep` / `knot link`.

**Validate project integrity via** `knot check` (cycles, dangling refs, schema, archive placement).

Never `cat .tickets/<id>--*.md`, `grep -r ... .tickets/`, `vim .tickets/...`, write a new file under `.tickets/` by hand, or `mv` files between `.tickets/` and `.tickets/archive/`.

Why this matters:

- `knot` keeps `:updated` and the computed graph consistent on every write. A hand-edit silently drifts.
- `knot` resolves partial IDs across both live and archive. File globs miss archived tickets entirely.
- `knot close` routes the file from `.tickets/` to `.tickets/archive/`. A hand-edit that flips `status: closed` leaves the file in the wrong directory and breaks future queries.

If a `knot` command behaves unexpectedly, surface the bug to the user. Don't reach for `vim`, `sed`, `cat`, or `mv`.
**The CLI is the contract** — `.tickets/` is an implementation detail. If knot's surface area can't express what you
need, that's a knot bug; file it, don't work around it.

### Red flags — STOP

| Rationalization                                                       | Reality                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "I'll just cat the file once to verify the close worked."             | `knot show <id>` works on archived tickets too.                                                                                                           |
| "I'll `knot create` then `knot show <new-id>` to verify what landed." | `knot create --json` already returns the full post-mutation ticket under `.data` — no chain needed. Same for every write command. See *JSON for parsing*. |
| "I just need to peek at `.knot.edn` for the allowed statuses."        | `knot prime --json` exposes the schema.                                                                                                                   |
| "knot show failed, let me read the markdown directly."                | Surface the bug. The file is not the contract.                                                                                                            |
| "I want to see all tickets at once, `ls .tickets/` is faster."        | `knot list --json` is stable and sees archive. `ls` doesn't.                                                                                              |
| "The user's in a hurry, I'll grep once and move on."                  | Greppable now, broken later. `knot list --json | jq` instead.                                                                                             |
| "I'll list everything and scan the TYPE column for bugs."             | `knot list --type bug`. Filters exist on every read command — use them.                                                                                   |

### Tool mapping — what to reach for

The rule is easier to internalize at the tool-call level. Before invoking one of these against `.tickets/`, switch to the knot equivalent:

| Tempted to use… on `.tickets/`   | Use this instead                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Read` / `cat` / `head` / `tail` | `knot show <id>`                                                                                                                                         |
| `Grep` / `grep` / `rg`           | `knot list --json \| jq '.data[] \| …'`                                                                                                                  |
| `ls`                             | `knot list` (or `knot list --json`)                                                                                                                      |
| `Write` (new file)               | `knot create "<title>" -d "..."`                                                                                                                         |
| `Edit` (modify file)             | `knot add-note <id> "..."` (additive), `knot update <id> --title ... --description ...` (non-interactive set/replace), or `knot edit <id>` (interactive) |
| `Bash` + `mv` to `archive/`      | `knot close <id> --summary "..."`                                                                                                                        |
| `Bash` + `mv` from `archive/`    | `knot reopen <id>`                                                                                                                                       |
| `Bash` + `rm` on a ticket file   | `knot delete <id>` (refuses when other tickets reference the target — drop the refs first, or use `--cascade` to rewrite them)                           |
| `sed -i` to flip `status:`       | `knot status <id> <new>`                                                                                                                                 |

### Already primed?

If a `<system-reminder>` from `SessionStart` already injected `knot prime` output (look for it near the top of the
conversation), don't re-run `knot prime`. The state there is current as of session start; for fresher state run `knot
list`, `knot ready`, or `knot show <id>` directly.

### Filter, don't eyeball

When the user's question targets a *subset* — a type, mode, tag, status, assignee, parent, or priority — pass the
matching filter rather than running bare `list` / `ready` / `blocked` / `closed` / `prime` and scanning the columns. All
five listing commands accept the same filter set (each repeatable):

```
--type <type>      --mode <afk|hitl>    --tag <tag>
--status <status>  --assignee <user>    --priority <0-4>
--limit <n>
```

Three graph filters narrow by relationship instead of attribute:

- `--parent <id>` — direct children (1 hop).
- `--closure <id>[,<id>…]` (with optional `--via parent,deps,links`) — undirected transitive closure over the whole corpus; "everything related."
- `--component <id>` — the seed's live-induced connected component (the action-companion of the `CC` column).

The listing tables also carry computed columns: `CC` (connected component), `CHLD` (umbrella progress), `LEV`
(leverage), `CPL` (coupling), `AC` (acceptance progress), `AGE`. Full layout: `CC ID STATUS PRI MODE TYPE ASSIGNEE AGE
[AC] [CHLD] [LEV] [CPL] TITLE`.

The graph filters and columns each have precise edge-case semantics (live-induced vs corpus-wide scope, fail-fast rules,
`--json` field shapes). **Before composing a graph query or interpreting a column, read
[`references/listing-filters-and-columns.md`](references/listing-filters-and-columns.md).**

On `prime`, filters apply across **all** sections (in_progress + ready + recently_closed) — `knot prime --assignee me`
shows only your tickets everywhere. Visual filtering is error-prone (titles wrap, columns shift, archived tickets are
absent) and harder for the user to verify. Reach for bare `list` only when the user actually wants the full picture.

When the user gives a partial id (`01kqa9`), pass it through verbatim — knot resolves it across live + archive. If it's
ambiguous, knot prints candidates; relay them, don't guess.

## Writing tickets

### Create

`knot create "<title>" [flags]` is the only way to create a ticket. Run
`knot create --help` for the full flag list. Most-used flags:

- `-t / --type` (default `task`)
- `-p / --priority` 0 (highest) … 4 (default 2)
- `-a / --assignee`
- `--mode afk` / `--mode hitl` (default `hitl`)
- `--tags`, `--parent`, `--external-ref`
- `-d / --description`, `--design` for body sections
- `--acceptance "<title>"` (repeatable) appends a structured acceptance criterion to frontmatter. Each entry is stored
  as `{title, done: false}`; `knot show` synthesizes a `## Acceptance Criteria` checklist from these at display time.
  There is no body section to author by hand.
- `--dep <id>` / `--link <id>` (both repeatable, one id per
  occurrence) wire the new ticket into the graph at create time.
  Asymmetry on missing targets:
  - `--dep` is **lenient** — an unresolved id is kept verbatim as a
    forward ref (matches `knot dep`'s tolerant-target contract).
  - `--link` is **strict** — every target must resolve uniquely, or
    the command fails before any file is written. Plain text reports
    `knot create: ...`; `--json` returns a `not_found` /
    `ambiguous_id` error envelope.
  Both flags accept partial ids, dedupe equivalents that resolve to
  the same ticket (preserving first-occurrence order), and may name
  archived targets — a reciprocal `--link` write does not unarchive
  the target. `--dep X --link X` records both. If multiple strict
  inputs are bad, the first failure in left-to-right CLI order wins.

Always pass `--description` when there's any context worth saving — a title-only ticket forces the next reader to
reconstruct intent from scratch. Default `--mode afk` when the work is well-specified and an agent could run end-to-end
without a human; otherwise leave the `hitl` default.

To verify what landed in a single invocation, pass `--json`. The envelope's `.data` carries the full post-mutation
ticket (id, frontmatter, body) — same shape as `knot show --json` minus the four computed inverse arrays
(`blockers`/`blocking`/`children`/`linked`). **Don't chain `knot show <id>` after a write to read back what you just
wrote** — the data is already in the write envelope. This applies to every mutating command: `create`, `update`,
`add-note`, `status`/`start`/`close`/`reopen`, `dep`/`undep`, `link`/`unlink`. See *JSON for parsing* for per-command
payload details.

For multi-line prose flags, use a quoted-delimiter heredoc so `$vars`, backticks, and quotes pass through literally:

```sh
knot create "Title" -t bug -p 1 --description "$(cat <<'EOF'
body with `code`, $vars, and "quotes" — all literal
EOF
)"
```

`knot add-note <id>` reads stdin natively — pipe directly:

```sh
knot add-note <id> <<'EOF'
note body
EOF
```

### Lifecycle

```sh
knot start <id>                                # → in_progress
knot status <id> <new-status>                  # generic transition
knot close <id> --summary "shipped in #482"
knot reopen <id>                               # restore from archive
knot delete <id>                               # remove the file (leaf-only)
knot delete <id> --cascade                     # also rewrite every referrer
```

Always pass `--summary` to `knot close`. The summary becomes a timestamped note and is the most useful artifact for
"what did we ship recently?" later. Skipping it loses information for free.

`knot delete <id>` is the destructive twin of `close` — useful for typo'd `create`s, AI-generated duplicates, and
pruning archive noise. Leaf-only by default: it **refuses** (exit 1) when any other ticket — live or archived —
references the target via `:parent`, `:deps`, or `:links`. The refusal enumerates each referrer + the field. The bare
command doubles as the dry-run for `--cascade` (same scan, same referrer list).

`knot delete <id> --cascade` opts into the rewrite: every referrer (live + archive) has the target dropped from
`:deps`/`:links` and its `:parent` dissoc'd (mirrors `undep` / `unlink`, including the empty-key prune). Re-running is
idempotent; `--cascade` on a leaf is a silent no-op.

There is no undo — `.tickets/` is git-tracked; `git checkout` is the documented recovery path. `--json` returns
`{ok:true, data:{deleted:{id,path}, cleaned:[{id,fields:[...]}]}}` on success and the `has_incoming_refs` error envelope
on refusal.

For projects with custom `:statuses` (e.g. adding `"review"` between `in_progress` and `closed`), prefer explicit `knot
status <id> <new>` over `knot start` / `knot close` so you don't accidentally skip a non-terminal stage.

#### Acceptance gate on terminal transitions

`knot close`, `knot status <id> <terminal>`, and `knot update <id> --status <terminal>` all enforce the v0.3 acceptance
gate: when the ticket is in `:active-status` (default `in_progress`) and any frontmatter `:acceptance` entry has `done:
false`, the transition is blocked (JSON `error.code = "acceptance_incomplete"`, exit 1).

The gate skips on:

- Empty / nil `:acceptance`.
- Intake → terminal transitions (no work was started).
- Terminal → terminal reclassifications (e.g. `closed → wontfix`).

Two ways to clear it:

1. Mark the AC done — `knot update <id> --ac "<title>" --done`. Composes with `--status` in one call: `knot update <id> --ac "last AC" --done --status closed` checks then closes.
2. `--force --summary "<reason>"`. Required pair: `--force` without a non-blank `--summary` exits `invalid_argument`. The summary is appended as a Notes entry and serves as the override record.

#### Open-children gate on start and close transitions

The open-children gate fires on two transitions:

- **Close** (`active → terminal`): `knot close`, `knot status <id> <terminal>`, `knot update <id> --status <terminal>`.
- **Start** (`* → active`): `knot start`, `knot status <id> <active>`, `knot update <id> --status <active>`.

The gate fires when the ticket has at least one child (any ticket whose `:parent` is this id) whose status is
non-terminal (JSON `error.code = "open_children"`, exit 1 — same envelope shape for both transitions).

The gate skips on:

- Tickets with no children.
- Parents whose children are all in a terminal status.
- `active → active` no-op transitions and intake → terminal transitions (no meaningful start or close).
- Terminal → terminal reclassifications.

Override is `--force`, with asymmetric `--summary` semantics:

- **Close**: `--force --summary "<reason>"` is the required pair — `--force` without a non-blank `--summary` exits
  `invalid_argument`. The summary is appended as a Notes entry and serves as the override record. When both AC and
  open-children gates would fire on the same close, a single `--force` bypasses both and stderr emits one warning per
  gate.
- **Start**: `--force` alone is enough (no `--summary` required, and passing `--summary` to a non-terminal target is
  rejected up front). Start is provisional — you can `update --status` back to intake at zero cost — so the bypass
  leaves only the stderr enumeration as a trace, not a Notes entry.

### Notes and editing

```sh
knot add-note <id> "raced GC under load"      # one-shot, append-only
knot add-note <id>                            # opens $EDITOR
knot edit <id>                                # opens whole file in $EDITOR
knot update <id> --priority 0 --tags p0,auth  # non-interactive set/replace
knot update <id> --description "New desc."    # replace ## Description in place
knot update <id> --body "Plain body."         # destructive whole-body replace
```

Prefer `knot add-note` for capturing observations mid-task. For **non-interactive** revisions (autonomous agents,
scripts), use `knot update <id> [flags...]` — it sets/replaces frontmatter and named body sections in one shot, returns
the post-mutation ticket via `--json`, and never opens an editor. Reach for `knot edit` only in interactive sessions to
free-form a file in `$EDITOR`; in an autonomous run with no terminal, `knot edit` will fail.

Flag set on `knot update`:

- Frontmatter: `--title`, `--type`, `--priority`, `--mode`, `--assignee`, `--parent`, `--tags` (comma-list),
  `--external-ref` (repeatable). Pass `""` (or no values for `--external-ref`) on optional fields to clear them; `--tags
  ""` clears all tags.
- Tag deltas: `--add-tag <t>` / `--remove-tag <t>` apply per-tag changes without round-tripping the full list
  (repeatable; mutually exclusive with `--tags`). Idempotent per tag; existing order is preserved, removes drop in
  place, adds append at the end. An empty resulting set clears `:tags`.
- Body sections (replace in place; create if missing): `--description`, `--design`.
- Acceptance flip: `--ac "<title>" --done` (or `--undone`) toggles the `:done` state of one frontmatter `acceptance`
  entry. The title must match exactly. `--done` and `--undone` are mutually exclusive; `--ac` requires one of them.
- Acceptance deltas: `--add-ac "<title>"` / `--remove-ac "<title>"` add or remove AC entries (repeatable; idempotent on
  exact-match title). Adds append with `done: false`; removes drop in place; emptying the list clears the `:acceptance`
  key. Composes with `--ac --done/--undone` in a single call — apply order is **add → flip → remove**, so a flip can
  target a just-added title. The same title in both directions exits 1 `invalid_argument`.
- Whole body: `--body <text>` — destructive, mutually exclusive with the sectional flags. There is **no `--force`** for
  `--body`; git is the documented undo path. The `## Acceptance Criteria` section in the body is **display-only on
  write** — `--body` does not sync the section back to frontmatter; use `--add-ac` / `--remove-ac` / `--ac` to mutate
  criteria.
- Status transition: `--status <new>`. AC mutations apply *before* the acceptance gate, so `knot update <id> --ac "last
  AC" --done --status closed` checks then closes in one call. `--summary` is required on terminal targets when
  overriding the gate; see *Acceptance gate on terminal transitions* above.
- `--force` (with `--summary`) bypasses the acceptance gate on a terminal `--status` transition. Silent no-op when the
  gate would not fire.
- `--json` returns the v0.3 envelope wrapping the post-mutation
  ticket (no `:meta` slot — `update` never archives).

`update` is purely set/replace. To **append** to a body, use `add-note` instead — that's its job.

### Graph operations

```sh
knot dep <from> <to>            # <from> waits on <to>; cycle-checked on add
knot dep tree <id>              # ASCII tree; --full to expand dups
knot undep <from> <to>

knot link <a> <b> [<c>...]      # symmetric peer link across every pair
knot unlink <from> <to>
```

`deps` are directional ("blocks") and honored by `knot ready`. `links` are symmetric ("see also"). Use `dep` when one
ticket has to wait on another; use `link` for "here's context". `knot dep` rejects cycle-creating edges at write time;
to scan an already-corrupted graph (e.g. after a hand-edit) use `knot check --code dep_cycle`.

## Project integrity

```sh
knot check                      # validate every ticket + config; exit 0/1/2
knot check <id>...              # narrow per-ticket checks; globals still run
knot check --code dep_cycle     # filter by issue code (repeatable)
knot check --severity error     # filter by severity (closed enum)
knot check --json               # envelope; data.issues sorted, data.scanned counts
```

`knot check` walks every ticket (live + archive) and the config and emits issues for: dep cycles, dangling
`:deps`/`:links`/`:parent` ids, invalid status/type/mode/priority, terminal-vs-archive placement, missing required
fields, frontmatter parse errors, and an invalid-`:active-status` config. Filters apply *before* the exit-code decision
(grep semantics). Exit `2` means unable to scan (no project root or invalid `.knot.edn`) — different from `1` (errors
found in the filtered view).

## AFK vs HITL: agent-runnable work

`mode` is a peer dimension to status and priority:

- `afk` = an agent can run this alone, no human in the loop
- `hitl` = needs a human (default for new tickets)

`knot ready --mode afk` is the canonical "what can an agent grab?" query. When **you** are the agent and the user has
handed you autonomy, run the checklist:

- [ ] `knot prime --mode afk` (skip if prime is already in the session)
- [ ] `knot ready --mode afk --json` to enumerate candidates
- [ ] `knot show <id>` to confirm scope
- [ ] `knot start <id>` to claim
- [ ] `knot add-note <id> "<progress>"` after non-trivial milestones
- [ ] `knot update <id> --priority …` / `--tags …` for non-interactive frontmatter or section revisions (never `knot edit` — it opens `$EDITOR` and will fail without a TTY)
- [ ] `knot close <id> --summary "<what landed>"` when shipped

Don't autonomously pick up `hitl` tickets unless the user explicitly authorizes that ticket. The mode is the contract.

## JSON for parsing

Every read AND mutating command accepts `--json` and emits a tagged envelope on stdout with snake_case keys. Warnings
and errors go to stderr. The canonical contract lives in [`references/json-protocol.md`](references/json-protocol.md) —
per-command `data` shapes, the full error-code catalogue, the `knot check` issue-code catalogue, and the partial-id
contract are pinned there (and in the knot repo, exercised by `test/knot/json_contract_test.clj`).

```json
{"schema_version": 1, "ok": true, "data": <payload>}
```

The payload sits at `.data`: an array for list-shaped commands (`list`, `ready`, `blocked`, `closed`), an object
otherwise (`show`, `dep tree`, `prime`, `check`). On errors the envelope flips to `{ok: false, error: {code, message,
...}}` with no `data` slot — except `knot check`, which may emit `{ok: false, data: {...}}` because its `ok` mirrors a
health verdict, not a request outcome.

**Mutating commands put the touched ticket under `.data`, eliminating the read-after-write round-trip — don't chain
`knot show <id>` after a write.** `close --json` (and any terminal `status`) additionally carries `meta.archived_to`
(POSIX-normalized path). Vector-default keys (`tags`, `deps`, `links`, `external_refs`) are always arrays in `--json`,
so `jq -r '.data[].tags[]'` is safe even on tickets that declare no tags.

Per-command `data` shapes, the full error-code catalogue, the partial-id contract, and `prime`'s `stale` /
`ready_to_close` fields are all pinned in [`references/json-protocol.md`](references/json-protocol.md).

```sh
knot list --json           | jq '.data[] | select(.priority <= 1)'
knot show <id> --json      | jq -r '.data.title'
knot check --json          | jq '.data.issues'   # integrity issues, if any

# Pick the highest-priority unblocked afk ticket, id only:
knot ready --json --mode afk | jq -r '.data | sort_by(.priority) | .[0].id'

# Mutate then read the post-state in one shot:
knot close <id> --json       | jq -r '.meta.archived_to'
knot create "T" --json       | jq -r '.data.id'
knot update <id> --priority 0 --tags p0 --json | jq -r '.data.priority'
```

For any decision logic, prefer `--json | jq` over parsing tables. Don't pipe table output through `awk`/`grep` — column
widths shift and titles can contain whitespace. `--json` is stable.

## Partial ID resolution

Ids are 12-char ULID suffixes (`01` + 10 base32 chars) prefixed with the project shortcode (`kno-`, `app-`, etc.). The
first 6–8 chars of the suffix are usually unique — `01kqa9sh` resolves day-to-day. knot resolves across live + archive.
On ambiguity, knot prints candidates; relay them to the user instead of guessing.

## Project setup

```sh
knot init
```

Run `knot init --help` for prefix / tickets-dir / force overrides. `.knot.edn` is plain EDN — `knot prime --json`
exposes the project's allowed `:statuses`, `:types`, and `:modes` if you need them; reading `.knot.edn` directly with
the Read tool is also fine when the CLI doesn't cover what you need.

## When this skill DOESN'T apply

GitHub Issues, Linear, Jira, Basecamp, Asana, Trello — different tools, different skills. Knot tickets live in the
working tree as markdown; hosted trackers do not. If the user names one of those (or references a remote id like
`GH-482`, `ENG-1234`), use the tool they named.

Most commands return `0` on success and `1` on error. `knot check` adds `2` for unable-to-scan (no project root or
invalid `.knot.edn`). Every read command supports `--json` and the filter flags `--type`, `--mode`, `--tag`, `--status`,
`--assignee` (each repeatable). Every mutating command (`create`, `start`, `status`, `close`, `reopen`, `delete`, `dep`,
`undep`, `link`, `unlink`, `add-note`, `update`) also supports `--json` — the envelope's `data` is the touched ticket(s)
(or `{deleted, cleaned}` for `delete`); `close --json` and terminal `status --json` add `meta.archived_to`. `knot check`
uses its own filters: `--severity` (error|warning, closed enum) and `--code` (open enum), both repeatable; OR within a
flag, AND across flags.

Every command rejects unknown flags: `knot <cmd> --bogus` exits 1 with `Unknown option: :bogus` on stderr rather than
silently absorbing the typo. If a flag you expect to work errors this way, consult `knot <cmd> --help` for the canonical
name (e.g. `--tag` vs `--tags` differs by command).
