# ViewBridge skill

**TL;DR.** Every Pulp plugin format adapter (VST3, AU v2, AU v3, CLAP,
AAX, Standalone) opens its editor through
`pulp::format::ViewBridge`. You only touch the bridge when you override
`Processor::create_view()` or write a new adapter. This skill captures
the invariants the API enforces and the pitfalls that bit us enough
times to be worth remembering.

## When to use ViewBridge

| Task | Touch ViewBridge? |
|---|---|
| Add a knob to the auto-generated editor | No — just `define_parameters` |
| Return a hand-built `view::View` tree from a processor | Yes — override `Processor::create_view()` |
| React when the host actually shows / resizes / closes the editor | Yes — override `on_view_opened / on_view_closed / on_view_resized` |
| Add a new format adapter | Yes — construct a `ViewBridge` and follow the lifecycle protocol |
| Hand the built view to an external container (TabPanel, WindowHost) | Yes — call `ViewBridge::release_view()` |
| Ship a paint-only overlay (inspector) | No — but `attach_secondary_view(…, ViewRole::Inspector)` is the primitive you'll eventually use |

`Processor`'s editor hooks (`create_view`, `view_size`, `on_view_*`) are
part of the node ABI surface. When adding a new view lifecycle hook, append
the virtual at the tail of `Processor`; never insert, remove, reorder, or
re-signature existing virtuals. `tools/scripts/node_abi_gate.py --mode=report`
is the fast check before pushing. The same rule applies to non-view Processor
virtuals: additive callbacks such as `process_f64(...)` belong after the
existing f32 process surface, and descriptor fields added for new capabilities
should be appended when positional aggregate initializer compatibility matters.

## Lifecycle protocol — adapter author side

```
bridge.open(&err)                 // builds the view; does NOT fire on_view_opened
  |
  +-- host.attach_to_parent(window)  // platform-specific
  |
bridge.notify_attached()          // fires Processor::on_view_opened
  |
bridge.resize(w, h)               // on each host resize; fires on_view_resized
  |
bridge.close()                    // fires Processor::on_view_closed iff attached
```

**Do not** fire `on_view_opened` before the host has actually attached
the view to a native parent. If attach fails after `open()`, a naive
implementation would fire
`on_view_opened` then destroy without a matching `on_view_closed` and
the plugin would leak host-window-dependent resources. `ViewBridge`
guarantees balance **only when the adapter honors the two-step
protocol** (`open()` then `notify_attached()`).

### Per-format attach point

| Format | `open()` is called here | `notify_attached()` is called here |
|---|---|---|
| VST3 | `CPluginView::attached()` before `attach_to_parent` | After `CPluginView::attached` returns `kResultTrue` |
| CLAP | `gui_create` | Inside `gui_set_parent` on the matched window API |
| AU v2 | `uiViewForAudioUnit` — after fetching context via `kPulpEditorContextProperty` | After `PluginViewHost::create` succeeds |
| AU v3 | `viewDidLoad` | After `PluginViewHost::attach_to_parent` in `viewDidLoad` |
| AAX | `AAX_CEffectGUI::CreateViewContainer()` — not `CreateViewContents()`, which runs before any window exists | After `try_attach_to_parent` succeeds |
| Standalone | Before `WindowHost::create` | After `WindowHost::create` succeeds |

AAX is the one adapter whose editor runs on its **own** `Processor`. AAX keeps
the host-side data model and the real-time algorithm apart, and the algorithm's
`Processor` lives in a private data block the model cannot reach, so
`EffectParameters` builds a second one for `create_view()` and mirrors its store
against the AAX parameter manager (the value authority). Do not "fix" that into
a shared instance by analogy with AU v2 — there, a second `Processor` was a real
bug; here it is the format's structure. See the `aax` skill.

## `release_view()` — for containers that own the view

`TabPanel::add_tab` and similar widgets take `std::unique_ptr<view::View>`.
Call `bridge.release_view()` to hand ownership over. The bridge keeps a
raw pointer so `notify_attached`, `resize`, and `close` continue to
dispatch `Processor::on_view_*` on the same view instance.

**Contract:** the caller must keep the released view alive until
`bridge.close()` runs (or the bridge is destroyed). The standalone
adapter handles this by calling `bridge.close()` explicitly after
`run_event_loop()` returns, before the `TabPanel` falls out of scope.

Standalone also has an editor-only path now: set
`StandaloneConfig::show_settings_tab = false` and `run_with_editor()`
will host the released editor root directly in `WindowHost` instead of
wrapping it in the outer `Editor/Settings` `TabPanel`. The same
ownership rule still applies: close the bridge before the released
root view is destroyed.

`run_with_editor()` also opts the host into the platform's native
file-dialog backend by calling `platform::FileDialog::install_native_backend()`
once the processor's editor is confirmed. This is a no-op on macOS (a
native impl is compiled in) and on platforms with no built-in backend
(iOS/Windows/Android), but on Linux it installs the xdg-desktop-portal
FileChooser bridge (`core/platform/.../file_dialog_portal_linux.cpp`,
talking to the portal over the runtime-dlopen `pulp::platform::DBus`
client) so editor file pickers work natively. We install here — not via a
static initializer — because raising a portal dialog blocks, so the
default "no backend → no selection" contract must hold for headless/test
callers until a host explicitly opts in.

Standalone now also keeps the bridge's size in sync with the real host
content area. `run_with_editor()` reads `WindowHost::get_content_size()`
immediately after `notify_attached()`, subtracts any standalone chrome
height, dispatches `ViewBridge::resize(...)`, and re-dispatches on each
`WindowHost::set_resize_callback(...)` event. If you embed a native child
or rely on `Processor::on_view_resized(...)`, do not assume
`editor_size()` is the last word after attach.

Standalone resizes the host window per active settings-chrome tab. The
Audio/MIDI `SettingsPanel` needs far more height than a fixed-size editor
(query `SettingsPanel::preferred_height()` — header + inner Audio/MIDI tab
bar + every Audio-tab row at full size), so a 372px-tall editor window
squishes the device dropdowns to slivers. `run_with_editor()` wires the
outer card-stack `TabPanel::on_tab_change` to drive the SAME design-viewport
path the keyboard resize uses — `set_design_viewport` /
`set_fixed_aspect_ratio` / `request_content_size` to `(editor_w, editor_h)`
on the Editor tab and `(editor_w, SettingsPanel::preferred_height())` on the
Settings tab. The editor tab keeps its exact declared size (no letterbox);
the Settings tab reflows to fill its taller window. Guarded on
`chrome.tab_panel()` so the editor-only chrome (no settings tab) is untouched.

Standalone headless/test launches must not show or activate a native
window. `StandaloneConfig::headless`, `PULP_HEADLESS`, `PULP_TEST_MODE`,
`CI`, or `PULP_SCREENSHOT` route `run_with_editor()` through
`WindowOptions::initially_hidden`; screenshot mode captures
`WindowHost::capture_back_buffer_png()`, not compositor-visible
`capture_png()`. If a CI/test run is headless but has no screenshot path,
`run_with_editor()` fails before creating the host so tests cannot park a
hidden live window forever.

The audio dumps (`audio_probe_json_path`, `audio_scope_json_path`,
`audio_capture_wav_path`, `audio_capture_rolling_path`; gated by
`PULP_ENABLE_AUDIO_PROBES`) are a SECOND headless one-shot family that reuses
the same `screenshot_frame_delay` counter (`detail::DelayedAction`): after the
delay the mode's writer runs — probe-json writes `output_probe().latest()` via
the pure `audio::audio_probe_snapshot_to_json()` helper — then the host closes.
No fake PNG bytes or cleared screenshot path are involved; a dump has no image
to validate, so the plain `DelayedAction` drives it with the write as its side
effect. A headless run without a screenshot path is valid as long as ANY of the
four is set (`standalone_headless_requires_screenshot` accepts all four) — don't
tighten the "headless requires screenshot" guard to reject them.

**The two arming paths do not compose alike, and only one of them is plural.**
With a screenshot, every dump writer is called from the screenshot `capture_fn`
(same frame, before the window closes) and each no-ops on an empty path — so any
combination of dumps works. Without a screenshot, the modes are a table in
`run_with_editor()` and the loop `break`s after arming the FIRST non-empty entry;
the rest are dropped silently, no error. Table order (probe-json, scope-json,
capture-wav, capture-rolling) IS the precedence. Two consequences:

- A headless run asking for two dumps at once yields one file. Pass a screenshot
  path too if you need both.
- **A new dump mode is a new row in that table, not a branch beside it.** Each
  arming wraps `pre_screenshot_idle` — not whatever callback is currently
  installed — and hands the result to `WindowHost::set_idle_callback`, which
  holds ONE callback. A second arming therefore overwrites the first one's
  one-shot rather than chaining after it, and the earlier dump never writes.
  The `break` is what keeps that unreachable.

## AU v3 controller lifecycle — runs on XPC queue, NOT main (Phase 3.5)

The host invokes `-[PulpAUMacViewController createAudioUnitWithComponentDescription:error:]`
(macOS) and `-[PulpAUViewController ...]` (iOS) on
`com.apple.NSXPCConnection.user.endpoint` — the XPC connection's
serial queue, not the main thread. Any AppKit / UIKit call from there
(`setPreferredContentSize:`, `self.view`, the `PluginViewHost`
attach) throws `NSInternalInconsistencyException` and kills the
.appex process. Host reports "Failed to load Audio Unit"; auval
silently passes because it doesn't exercise the controller path.

`au_view_controller_mac.mm` + `au_view_controller_ios.mm` apply a
HARD GUARD at the top of `rebuildEditorIfReady` that bounces the body
to `dispatch_get_main_queue()` if invoked off-main. **Don't guard
only at `setAudioUnit:`** — the compiler can inline the property
setter when `createAudioUnit` assigns to `self.audioUnit`, bypassing
the check. The guard must live in `rebuildEditorIfReady`.

Full recipe (macOS framework + stub .appex + container .app, signing,
notarization, PlugInKit diagnostics) is in
`.agents/skills/auv3/SKILL.md → "macOS AU v3 packaging"`.

### AU v3 teardown must ALSO run on the main thread

The same off-main hazard applies to `-dealloc`. A GPU-backed
`PluginViewHost` owns a `CVDisplayLink` whose idle pump
(`make_scripted_idle_pump`) is `dispatch_async`'d to the **main queue**
and dereferences the `ViewBridge`. If the last controller release lands
on the XPC connection queue (it can — `createAudioUnit…` and the rebuild
bounce arrive off-main), destroying the host + bridge off-main races a
main-queue idle block already past its `alive` liveness check → the pump
touches a freed bridge (SIGSEGV in `display_link_callback`). This is the
same use-after-free the AU v2 Cocoa view fixed by serializing teardown.
Both AU v3 `dealloc`s (`au_view_controller_mac.mm`,
`au_view_controller_ios.mm`) reset `_viewHost` on the main thread first
(`[NSThread isMainThread] ? reset : dispatch_sync(main, reset)`) — that
flips the host's liveness token and stops the display link before any
freeing — then let the remaining ivars destroy in the documented
reverse-declaration order. **Don't** remove the main-thread reset, and
**don't** instead try to clear `idle_callback_` from the off-main
`dealloc`: writing the `std::function` while the main-queue block is
calling it is just a different data race. Only main-thread serialization
closes it. The GPU host's `display_link_callback` block additionally
copies the idle callback locally and **re-checks `alive` after** running
idle (a scripted `poll()` can reentrantly close the editor and free
`self`) — parity with the CPU host's `render_link_callback`.

### macOS AU v3: editor attach is now DEFERRED until a settled host size

`rebuildEditorIfReady` no longer creates the `PluginViewHost` (or calls
`ViewBridge::notify_attached()`) inline. Logic hosts AU v3 out-of-process and
does **not** deliver its restored window size to the extension's view on initial
open, so a `PluginViewHost` built then would paint its first frame at the design
size inside Logic's smaller window (clipped). Instead `rebuildEditorIfReady`
opens the bridge, sets `preferredContentSize`, wires a `setFrameSize:` hook on a
custom `PulpAUMacRootView` (which fills its superview the **frame-based** way —
`autoresizingMask`, NOT Auto Layout: constraint pinning crashed Ableton Live, see
the auv3 SKILL), and marks the host
**pending**; `-createViewHostIfReady` then builds the host **at the view's real
bounds** — and only there fires `notify_attached()`. **Consequence for adapter
authors:** on macOS AU v3, `Processor::on_view_opened` (via `notify_attached`)
fires slightly later — after the host's first real layout, not at controller
build — and `_pendingRoot`/`_viewHostPending` gate the one-shot creation. Don't
move `notify_attached()` back inline; it reintroduces the first-paint clip.
Rationale + the view-config/first-paint root cause are in
`.agents/skills/auv3/SKILL.md → "Logic OOP first-paint clip"`. The same controller also calls `set_design_viewport_top_align(true)` so the AU design anchors to the TOP of a taller host pane (REAPER FX-chain) like CLAP/VST3 instead of centering between bands — see the auv3 SKILL.

**iOS editor sizing differs from macOS — it FILLS the pane.**
`au_view_controller_ios.mm` deliberately does NOT pin a design viewport: it
lays the root out at the actual pane bounds (via `resizeEditorToViewBounds` →
`set_size` + `ViewBridge::resize`) so a responsive flex scene fills edge-to-edge.
Aspect-locked design-viewport scaling letterboxed the pane (dark bars on the
sides) and pushed header text to the edge. The `notify_attached` → `resize`
protocol is unchanged; only the viewport policy differs. A genuinely
fixed-aspect iOS editor that wants letterboxing can call `set_design_viewport`
itself. See the `ios` skill for the responsive-scene + `syncCanvasSize` contract.

## AU v2 dual-Processor gotcha (fixed)

Pre-ViewBridge, the AU v2 Cocoa view factory called
`format::registered_factory()` and built a **second** `Processor` +
`StateStore` for the UI, syncing parameters one-shot at construction.
Any parameter change on the audio thread drifted from the UI.

Post-fix: `au_v2_adapter.{hpp,cpp}` exposes the host `Processor*` +
`StateStore*` via a private AU property `kPulpEditorContextProperty`
(`'PuEd'`). The view factory fetches it with `AudioUnitGetProperty`
and drives a `ViewBridge` against the host's single Processor.

AU v3 does the same thing via the ObjC accessors
`-[PulpAudioUnit pulpProcessor]` and `-[PulpAudioUnit pulpStore]`.

**If you add another AU-like adapter, expose the same pair.** Never
spin up a second Processor for the UI.

AU v3 render automation also attaches its block-local
`ParameterEventQueue` to the existing audio `Processor` immediately
before `process()` via `set_param_events(...)`. Treat that pointer like
the MIDI/MPE sidecars: it is valid only during the current process call
and must not be captured by editor/view code.

**Trigger / momentary params and the shared StateStore.** An editor that
raises a *trigger* parameter (`ParamInfo::is_trigger`, or a
`ParamDesignation::Reset` "reset/panic" control) on the shared store is
writing a one-shot: the adapter's render path calls
`StateStore::reset_triggers_rt()` after each `Processor::process` block,
which returns the parameter to its default. Editor/view code therefore
must not assume a trigger it set stays raised across frames — it is
observed for one block and then auto-settles. Read it back from the
store if you need to reflect the resting state in the UI.

## Secondary views

```cpp
view::View* ViewBridge::attach_secondary_view(std::unique_ptr<view::View>, ViewRole);
bool        ViewBridge::detach_secondary_view(view::View*);
size_t      ViewBridge::view_count()                const;
view::View* ViewBridge::view_at(size_t index);
ViewRole    ViewBridge::role_at(size_t index)       const;  // Editor, Inspector, Remote
```

Roles are opaque — the bridge only uses them for introspection.
Parameter bindings propagate automatically because every attached view
polls the same `StateStore`; there is no explicit broadcast step.

Remote views attach through `ViewBridge::attach_remote_channel(channel, label)`
as `ViewRole::Remote` secondaries. The bridge does not own URL parsing or socket
creation; callers connect a `MessageChannel` first and hand it to the bridge.

## Parameter type-in round-trips through `ParamInfo` (shared with the editor)

The same `StateStore` every attached view polls (see *Secondary views*) is
also the source of truth for the host's parameter **display strings** and its
**generic type-in field**. As of G5 all four format adapters route the
host-facing text↔value conversion through the *same* `ParamInfo::to_string` /
`from_string` your editor draws from:

| Format | Host callback that now honors `ParamInfo` |
|---|---|
| VST3 | `getParamStringByValue` / `getParamValueByString` |
| AU v2 | `kAudioUnitProperty_ParameterStringFromValue` / `...ValueFromString` (+ `kAudioUnitParameterFlag_ValuesHaveStrings` when a `to_string` exists) |
| CLAP | `params_value_to_text` / `params_text_to_value` |

The CLAP `params_text_to_value` change is the one that lands on the shared
`clap_entry.hpp` (hence this skill is dual-mapped with `clap`): it now tries
`ParamInfo::from_string` **before** the generic locale-independent `strtod`, so
a fully custom rendering ("quality=0.75", an enum label, "12 o'clock")
round-trips instead of being rejected by a bare numeric parse. CLAP values are
plain (`min..max`) — the exact domain `from_string` returns — so no
normalization step is needed; VST3 converts to/from the host's normalized
domain around the same call.

**Editor consequence.** A parameter's on-screen value string (drawn by your
view) and the host's generic type-in field now agree, because both derive from
the same `ParamInfo` converters on the shared store. Two rules for editor
authors:

- **Don't add a parallel text parser in the editor.** Type-in a user enters in
  your own field should call the SAME `ParamInfo::from_string` (or bind through
  the store) so your field and the host's stay consistent.
- **Decline by returning a non-finite value.** A `from_string` that yields
  NaN/±inf is rejected: CLAP falls through to the numeric parse, VST3/AU decline
  to the base class. So a parameter with no meaningful string form should return
  NaN rather than a garbage value.

Tests: `test/test_clap_entry.cpp`, `test/test_vst3_param_display.cpp`,
`test/test_au_v2_param_display.mm`.

## Trackpad / Scroll-Wheel Zoom Event Path

**Searchable keywords**: trackpad zoom, scroll-wheel zoom, mouse wheel, "1.00x zoom" stuck, deltaY missing, deltaY=0, wheel event not firing, FilterBank zoom, Spectr zoom, onWheel, addEventListener('wheel'), registerWheel never called, wheel bubble, ancestor not receiving wheel, canvas-child captures wheel, wheel handler short-circuits.

**Symptom**: in Spectr (and likely any @pulp/react consumer that uses a
canvas child inside a wheel-handling wrap-div), scroll-wheel or
trackpad scroll over the canvas does NOT trigger the wrap-div's zoom
handler. The zoom indicator stays "1.00x" no matter how many wheel
events fire.

**Three independent bugs stacked**, all needed fixing to make zoom work:

### Bug A: `on(id, 'wheel', fn)` never invoked `registerWheel(id)`
The `on()` JS function in `kJSPreamble` mapped event names to native
registrars (click → `registerClick`, pointer events → `registerPointer`,
gesture events → `registerGesture`), but had **no case for `'wheel'`**.
Spectr's editor.js bound a wheel handler via `addEventListener('wheel',
fn)` which routes through `on(id, 'wheel', fn)`. The callback was
stored in `__callbacks__[id + ':wheel']` but the native side was never
told this view wanted wheel events. Result: `registerWheel` ran for 0
views, wheel events had no JS receivers.

**Fix**: add a `wheel` case to `on()` + a `wheel` group to
`__ensureNativeRegistered__()` so `on(id, 'wheel', fn)` calls
`registerWheel(id)` to wire the native dispatch. (`core/view/src/widget_bridge.cpp` `kJSPreamble`.)

### Bug B: bubble loop short-circuited on the wrong handler
`window_host_mac.mm::scrollWheel:` walked from the hit-tested deepest
view up to find the first ancestor with `on_pointer_event` set, then
delivered the wheel event there and returned. But the deepest hit
(typically a Canvas2D child) had `on_pointer_event` registered via
`registerPointer` (for pointerdown/up/move/cancel) — that lambda
short-circuits on `is_wheel` (it's the pointer-only handler). The
bubble therefore delivered the wheel event to a no-op handler and
returned, never reaching the wrap-div ancestor that had registered the
ZOOM handler via `registerWheel`.

**Fix**: change `scrollWheel:` to deliver to EVERY ancestor with
`on_pointer_event` set (not stop at the first). Each handler self-
filters on `me.is_wheel`: `registerPointer`'s lambda short-circuits
when `is_wheel == true`, `registerWheel`'s short-circuits when `false`.
So a view that registered both gets both halves; a view that registered
only one ignores the other. ScrollView ancestor still takes precedence
and stops the walk. (`core/view/platform/mac/window_host_mac.mm`.)

### Bug C: wheel-event payload must include `clientX/clientY/deltaY`
The bridge emits
`{deltaX, deltaY, clientX, clientY}` as an object (not positional args)
so the `@pulp/react` synthetic-event shim's `isPlainObject(rawArgs[0])`
branch can lift the fields. Without this, even after Bugs A+B were
fixed, `e.deltaY` would be undefined and `e.clientX - rect.left` would
read 0.

### How to diagnose if zoom is broken again

1. `fprintf(stderr, ...)` in `scrollWheel:` to confirm the NSView even
   receives the event — if not, accessibility / focus issue.
2. Confirm `registerWheel('<view_id>')` is being called after the
   view's editor.js mounts. If never called, Bug A is back.
3. Confirm the bubble walk reaches the wrap-div, not stopping at the
   canvas child. Print the chain `target → parent → … → root` and
   note which have `on_pointer_event` set.
4. Confirm `__dispatch__(view_id, 'wheel', {deltaX, deltaY, clientX,
   clientY})` is called with non-zero deltas. If `clientX/clientY` are
   0, `me.window_position` was not set in `scrollWheel:`.
5. In Spectr's `native-react/dist/editor.js` bundle, `grep deltaY` —
   expect ≥3 mentions. If 1 or 0, the bundle was built against an old
   `@pulp/react` without the synthetic-event delta fields and the
   bundle needs `npm run build:port`.

### Tooling: drive wheel events programmatically

`cliclick` has no wheel command (`w:N` is WAIT, not WHEEL). Compile a
tiny tool:

```c
// /tmp/scroll-event.c
#include <ApplicationServices/ApplicationServices.h>
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    int count = argc > 1 ? atoi(argv[1]) : 10;
    int delta = argc > 2 ? atoi(argv[2]) : 5;
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        CGEventRef ev = CGEventCreateScrollWheelEvent(NULL, kCGScrollEventUnitLine, 1, delta);
        CGEventPost(kCGHIDEventTap, ev);
        CFRelease(ev);
        usleep(50000);
    }
}
```

Build: `clang -framework ApplicationServices -o /tmp/scroll-event /tmp/scroll-event.c`. Posts real CGEvent scroll-wheel events that reach `NSView::scrollWheel:`. Use `/tmp/scroll-event 30 5` to inject 30 scroll-up events.

## Stale-Header ABI Mismatch

**Searchable keywords**: silent crash, "Standalone: editor window open"
then exit, segfault inside `WidgetBridge::register_api()::$_NNN`,
`byte read Translation fault` at `x9=0` during Promise reaction, JS
`__dispatch__` from `pump_message_loop`, Spectr exits after CoreAudio
init, `pointer_registered_`, `wheel_registered_`, link-swap, install
prefix, `/tmp/pulp-sdk-gpu-latest`, `pulp upgrade --install`.

**The trap**: any PR that adds/removes/reorders **member variables**
on `WidgetBridge` (or any other class whose layout consumers compile
against) changes the C++ struct layout. If the **installed SDK
header** under the consumer's `Pulp_DIR` is OLDER than the
**installed SDK static library**, the consumer's translation units
compute member offsets from the old (smaller) layout while the lib's
own translation units (lambdas registered in `register_api()`) use the
new (larger) layout. Member access from a lambda points into the
wrong byte — typically NULL or garbage — and the first access
SIGSEGVs.

This presents as a "silent crash" because:
- macOS shows the editor window briefly
- The first paint frame logs `[gpu-host] first frame: …`
- Then a Promise reaction (React's commit phase) fires a registered
  C++ callback that does a member load → segfault → process dies
- The standalone parent (zsh / shell) reports nothing useful

The macOS crash report tells you everything: open
`~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/<App>-<date>.ips`, look at thread 0's
faulting frame. If it's `WidgetBridge::register_api()::$_NNN + <offset>`
with `Exception Subtype: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x…` and `x9=0` (or
some other register pointing into the bridge struct), you have an ABI
mismatch.

**Fix**:
```bash
# Re-install the header to the SDK consumer's install prefix
cp core/view/include/pulp/view/widget_bridge.hpp \
   "$PULP_SDK_INSTALL/include/pulp/view/widget_bridge.hpp"

# Wipe the consumer's stale .o files (they were compiled with old offsets)
rm -rf "$CONSUMER/build/CMakeFiles/<your-target>.dir"

# Rebuild the consumer from clean
tools/ci/governed-build.sh cmake --build "$CONSUMER/build" --target <your-target>
```

When you `pulp upgrade --install` this is automatic because the SDK
release lays down headers + libs together from one build. The trap
only fires when you **link-swap a fresh `libpulp-view.a` into an SDK
install whose header is stale**, which is the failure mode for local
SDK-side iteration outside the `pulp upgrade` flow.

**Belt-and-suspenders mitigation** (TODO followup): consider adding a
build-time assertion in widget_bridge.hpp using `_Static_assert(sizeof(WidgetBridge) == EXPECTED, …)`,
where `EXPECTED` is generated at SDK release time from the actual
library build. A stale header would then fail to compile against the
fresh lib instead of segfaulting at first paint.

## Common pitfalls

1. **Forgetting `notify_attached()` after a successful attach.** The
   host will show the view but `Processor::on_view_opened` never fires,
   so any lifecycle-tied setup (listener registration, meter startup)
   silently skips.
2. **Calling `close()` after destroying the released view.** Lifecycle
   dispatch then runs on a dangling pointer. Always close the bridge
   first, then let the caller-owned view destruct.
3. **Creating a second Processor in the editor path.** Fetch the host
   Processor via the format-specific accessor (AU v2 property, AU v3
   ObjC selector, CLAP / VST3 constructor param).
4. **Hard-coding `editor_size()` when you actually want resize
   bounds.** Prefer `pulp_add_plugin(... DESIGN_WIDTH N DESIGN_HEIGHT N)`
   over a per-plugin `view_size()` override for imported-design plugins;
   the macros flow into the default
   `Processor::view_size()` via `format::view_size_from_design(...)`,
   which derives `min = preferred * 2/3` and `max = 2 * preferred`. The
   derived `min > 0` is what makes CLAP's `gui_can_resize` engage.
   Override `view_size()` directly only when the dimensions are computed
   at runtime (rare).
5. **Forgetting that adapters must read `bridge.size_hints().min_*`
   when building the host's `WindowOptions`.** The bridge caches
   `Processor::view_size()` in `size_hints_`, but each adapter is
   responsible for forwarding `min_width`/`min_height` (and
   `preferred_*`) into its window/host options. The standalone
   adapter centralizes this in `detail::make_standalone_window_options`
   so the chrome-height shift is applied consistently. Other
   adapters wiring an OS window (e.g. host apps registering a
   `WindowHost::Factory`) need the same propagation; reading only
   `preferred_*` leaves the OS host with a zero minimum and lets
   plugins shrink below their declared floor.
6. **Idle-pump must drain timers + frames + async results — not just
   frames.** The platform host idle entry point (Mac CVDisplayLink,
   iOS CADisplayLink, Android AChoreographer) is the only thing that
   drives `WidgetBridge` per vsync when no input event fires. There
   are TWO bridge methods that drain different queues:
   - `poll_async_results()`: async-shell results (`execAsync` callbacks)
     + rAF callbacks (`__flushFrames__`). Does NOT pump message loop
     or drain timers.
   - `service_frame_callbacks()`: pumps engine message loop + drains
     native-tracked `setTimeout` / `setInterval` (`__flushTimers__`)
     + rAF callbacks. Does NOT drain async-shell results.

   Host idle paths must call BOTH (`poll_async_results()` first, then
   `service_frame_callbacks()`). Calling only the first drops timer
   callbacks on the floor — `setTimeout(fn, 100)` queues forever and
   only fires when an unrelated event happens to pump the message loop.
   `ScriptedUiSession::poll()` does this pair on Mac/iOS standalone;
   `core/render/platform/android/gpu_surface_android.cpp::android_render_frame()`
   does the same pair on Android. Tests live under `[issue-1412]` in
   `test/test_widget_bridge.cpp`.
7. **Design-viewport pointTransform block holds raw `this` — clear it
   in the host dtor.** Both `MacPluginViewHost::~` and
   `MacGpuPluginViewHost::~` MUST run `view_.pointTransform = nil` /
   `metal_view_.pointTransform = nil` inside an `@autoreleasepool`
   BEFORE the C++ host frees itself. DAWs routinely retain the
   returned NSView after disposal (attach_to_parent hands it to the
   DAW's view hierarchy); a later `mouseDown:` would otherwise invoke
   the block on freed memory. This is the same ownership shape as the
   deferred-click teardown token. Test: `pulp-test-plugin-view-host-design-viewport`
   has the dtor-clears-pointTransform regression case.
8. **`paint_overlays` MUST run inside the design-viewport transform.**
   ComboBox dropdowns, claimed overlays, and the inspector layer all
   draw in root-view coordinates, and mouse input inverse-maps
   window→root through `pointTransform` before `hit_test`. Painting
   overlays outside the transform puts them at root coords in window
   space → visually misaligned + non-clickable at any host size that
   isn't exactly the design size. Mac plugin host paint paths (CPU
   `drawRect:` and GPU `paint_scene`) call `View::paint_overlays`
   INSIDE the save/translate/scale block, matching the standalone
   `MacGpuWindowHost::paint_scene` overlay-inside-transform rule.
9. **A GPU display-link idle pump can outlive its `ViewBridge` — guard on
   `ViewBridge::alive_token()`, not the host's own `alive_`.** The GPU
   scripted-idle pump (`gpu_host_select.hpp::make_scripted_idle_pump`) is
   dispatched to the main queue by `CVDisplayLink` and captures the bridge by
   raw pointer. Two ways it runs after the bridge is gone: (a) a host reloading
   the embedded view REPLACES the bridge (`_bridge = make_unique<…>`) while the
   host + its idle callback survive, and (b) `CVDisplayLinkStop` does NOT join
   an in-flight callback during teardown. The host's `alive_` token guards the
   HOST, not the bridge, so it does not cover case (a). Fix: `ViewBridge` owns
   its own `std::shared_ptr<std::atomic<bool>> alive_` (`alive_token()`), flipped
   false FIRST in `~ViewBridge` before `close()`; the pump captures a COPY of
   that token and no-ops when it reads false. This crashed the PulpTempoSampler
   AU embedded in Ableton Live 12 (EXC_BAD_ACCESS in `store()`/`scripted_ui()`
   on a freed bridge, v1.6.1). The token makes the no-op DECISION safe — it does
   NOT make a cross-thread deref of the raw bridge pointer safe, so teardown must
   stay on the main thread. General rule: any display-link/cross-thread callback
   capturing a raw pointer to a REPLACEABLE owned object needs a liveness token
   on THAT object, not just its host. Test: `[idle-pump][crash]` in
   `test_view_bridge.cpp` builds the pump, destroys the bridge, calls the pump →
   no-op instead of use-after-free.
10. **In a multi-plugin bundle, editor/metadata callbacks must resolve
    PER-INSTANCE state — never a process global.** A CLAP/AU/VST3 bundle exposes
    N plugins from one binary, so a single shared descriptor global would hand
    every plugin's editor the *first* plugin's metadata. The CLAP adapter caches
    a per-instance `PulpClapPlugin::descriptor_snapshot` at `create_plugin()`
    time; the audio/note-port and descriptor callbacks read
    `self->processor ? processor->descriptor() : descriptor_snapshot`, never a
    file-scope global. When wiring a new editor-facing callback (bus layout,
    channel names, editor size, feature flags) in a bundle-capable adapter, pull
    the answer from the instance's own processor/descriptor snapshot, or from the
    keyed registry entry looked up by the instance's id — a global read silently
    returns another plugin's data only once a second plugin ships, so it passes
    every single-plugin test. Registry lookup is `find_plugin(id)`; the id is the
    plugin's `bundle_id`.

## Tests

`test/test_view_bridge.cpp` is the canonical reference:
- `"ViewBridge falls back to AutoUi when create_view returns nullptr"`
- `"ViewBridge honors custom create_view()"`
- `"ViewBridge supports secondary views"`
- `"ViewBridge defers on_view_opened until notify_attached"`
- `"ViewBridge close without attach does not fire on_view_closed"`
- `"ViewBridge destructor closes view"`
- `"ViewBridge cross-format lifecycle invariants"` (VST3 / CLAP / AU v2 /
  AU v3 / Standalone / failed-attach replay)
- `"scripted idle pump no-ops after the ViewBridge is destroyed"`
  (`[idle-pump][crash]`) — the GPU display-link pump liveness-token guard
  (pitfall 9); build the pump, `reset()` the bridge, call the pump → no UAF.

Run with `ctest --test-dir build -R ViewBridge --output-on-failure`.

## Remote views

`ViewBridge::attach_remote_channel(channel, label)` registers a
`RemoteViewSession` driving a `MessageChannel` (WebSocket or in-process
loopback) as a `ViewRole::Remote` secondary. The session speaks the
protocol in `docs/reference/remote-view-protocol.md`:

- `view.hello` + `view.metadata` handshake
- `view.param_set` / `view.param_changed` wire through `StateStore`
- `view.param_get` request/response
- `view.input` (notification)
- `view.close` (either side)

Tests: `test/test_remote_view.cpp` covers handshake, metadata escaping,
parameter sync, input forwarding, close handling, null-channel rejection, and
stale-session detach behavior via MemoryMessageChannel loopback.

### Attaching from an MCP server

An MCP server that runs alongside a Pulp plugin host can open a
`RemoteViewSession` to drive the plugin's view from Claude Code:

1. MCP server can declare a tool (e.g. `view_attach`, `view_param_set`,
   `view_param_get`) backed by `pulp::runtime::WebSocketChannel::connect(...)`.
2. Tool handler calls `bridge->attach_remote_channel(std::move(ws), "mcp")`
   where `bridge` is the host's ViewBridge (same process) — or opens
   the socket *to* a separate Pulp host process that listens via
   `WebSocketChannel::accept`.
3. Subsequent MCP tool calls drive `RemoteViewSession::set_parameter`
   / `get_parameter` / `send_input`.

This is the pattern. A concrete MCP-tool wrapper bundled with Pulp is
a small follow-up on top of `tools/mcp/pulp_mcp.cpp`.

### Paint-op streaming

Not yet wired. Current MVP: the remote renderer is expected to mirror
its own view hierarchy informed by `view.metadata`. Canvas-command
streaming is the next increment — see the "Not yet wired" section of
the protocol doc.

### AU editor `dealloc` ordering — never call `bridge->close()` explicitly

When a `ViewBridge` and a `PluginViewHost` are owned by the same C++
scope (a struct, an Obj-C class's ivars), C++ destroys members in
REVERSE declaration order. AU's editor wrappers
(`PulpAUEditorOwnership` for AU v2 Cocoa view, `PulpAUViewController`
for AUv3 iOS) declare the bridge first and the host second so the
host (which holds `View& root_`) is torn down BEFORE the bridge that
owns the View. The host's destructor can then safely call
`root_.set_plugin_view_host(nullptr)` to clear the back-pointer; then
`~ViewBridge` fires `Processor::on_view_closed` and resets the View.

Calling `bridge->close()` explicitly inside dealloc reverses that
order — the View dies first, the host's `~PluginViewHost` then
dereferences a dangling `root_` reference, and AU editor close
crashes the host process. Do not reintroduce an explicit close in the
AU dealloc path. The full rationale lives in the `auv2`, `auv3`, and
`ios` skills since those files are dual-/triple-mapped.

### Standalone editor lane DOES need explicit `bridge->close()` before `stop()`

The "never call close() explicitly" rule above applies to AU dealloc
because the bridge and host are RAII-owned and destroyed in reverse
declaration order. The standalone app lane in
`core/format/src/standalone.cpp` is different: `run_with_editor()`
exits when `window->run_event_loop()` returns, and that can happen via
two paths:

1. **Window-close callback path** — the close handler already called
   `bridge->close()` while processor and view were both alive.
2. **Application-quit path** — the event loop returns without ever
   firing the window-close callback, so the bridge never saw `close()`.

If path 2 falls through to `stop()` without an explicit close, the
processor is torn down with a still-attached bridge and the view's
`on_view_closed` either never fires or fires against a freed
processor. The fix is to call `bridge->close()` unconditionally after
the event loop returns and before `stop()` — `close()` is idempotent,
so path 1 stays correct.

When you add a new host lane (CLI, embedded runner, foreign host), do
the same audit: is the bridge owned by an RAII path that guarantees
ordering (AU pattern, no explicit close), or does the lane have a
return path that bypasses the window-close callback (standalone
pattern, explicit close before processor teardown)?

## EditorBridge — JSON message dispatch over the editor lifecycle

`pulp::format::ViewBridge` (this skill) handles **when** the editor
exists. `pulp::view::EditorBridge` handles **what messages flow
between it and the processor** while it does. Use both:

```cpp
class MyEditor : public pulp::view::View {
    void wire(pulp::view::WebViewPanel& panel) {
        bridge_.add_handler("set_value", [this](const auto& payload) {
            const auto v = pulp::view::EditorBridge::get_float(payload, "value", 0.0f);
            // ... apply to processor ...
            return pulp::view::EditorBridge::ok_response();
        });
        bridge_.attach_webview(panel);          // routes WebView postMessage → handlers
    }
    void unwire(pulp::view::WebViewPanel& panel) {
        bridge_.detach_webview(panel);          // clears the installed callback before teardown
    }
private:
    pulp::view::EditorBridge bridge_;
};
```

Key invariants:

- **Renderer-agnostic.** `attach_webview(WebViewPanel&)` today;
  `attach_native_runtime(JsRuntime&, "<handler_name>")` for the
  native-JS-runtime import lane. Same handler registrations.
- **Explicit WebView teardown.** `detach_webview(WebViewPanel&)`
  clears the callback installed by `attach_webview`. Use it when the
  bridge and `WebViewPanel` are side-by-side members and you want to
  sever queued WebView messages before native detach or panel destruction.
- **noexcept dispatch.** `dispatch_json(...)` and `dispatch(...)` are
  `noexcept` and always return a well-formed JSON response envelope —
  handler exceptions become `{"ok":false,"error":"internal error"}`.
- **Standard envelope error vocabulary** (substring-compatible with
  Spectr's existing test suite — that compatibility is load-bearing
  for the Spectr cutover acceptance criterion):
  - `malformed_json` — JSON parse failed / root not object
  - `unknown_type` — no handler registered
  - `missing_field` — envelope missing/empty/non-string `type`
  - `wrong_type` — handler-emitted via `err_response("...")`
  - `internal_error` — handler threw
- **Plugin-specific drag/edit state stays in the handler closure** —
  the framework explicitly does NOT carry `EditorBridgeState`-style
  per-session state. Capture it on `[this]` instead.

When you change `core/view/src/editor_bridge.cpp` or its header, the
skill-sync gate requires updates to either *this* skill or the
`import-design` skill (or both). The path map maps both to the file.

## Event-bridge dispatch payload contract — the @pulp/react surface

WidgetBridge talks to JS by calling `__dispatch__(id, eventName, ...rawArgs)`.
The `@pulp/react` synthetic-event shim (`packages/pulp-react/src/synthetic-event.ts`)
inflates those raw args into a React-DOM-compatible event. **Both sides
of this contract must move together or JSX handlers silently break.**

The shim's `makeSyntheticEvent` only lifts fields off the first arg when
`isPlainObject(rawArgs[0])` is true. Positional args (e.g. `wheel(dx, dy)`)
fall through to the empty default object and `e.deltaY` is `undefined`.
That class of regression is what cost us multiple PRs on the Spectr
band-drawing / trackpad-zoom / Escape-modal fixes.

### Required payload shapes

| Event family | Raw shape (object literal) | Why each field |
|---|---|---|
| `pointerdown` / `pointerup` / `pointercancel` | `{clientX, clientY, offsetX, offsetY, pointerId, pointerType, isPrimary, pressure, altitudeAngle, azimuthAngle, button (W3C: 0=left, 1=middle, 2=right), ctrlKey, shiftKey, altKey, metaKey}` | JSX reads `e.clientX - rect.left`, hit-tests by `e.button`, and gates UI on modifier booleans |
| `pointermove` | `{clientX, clientY, offsetX, offsetY, pointerId, pointerType, isPrimary}` | dragged from `on_drag(local pos)`; `clientX/Y` MUST be window-relative — walk parent-chain `bounds()` to compute |
| `wheel` | `{deltaX, deltaY, clientX, clientY}` **as an object, not positional args** | The synthetic-event shim's plain-object branch is the only one that lifts wheel deltas |
| `keydown` / `keyup` | `{key (W3C UIEvent.key string: 'Escape', 'ArrowLeft', 'F1', 'a', ' ', etc.), keyCode (raw int), ctrlKey, shiftKey, altKey, metaKey, mods}` | JSX compares `e.key === 'Escape'`; the raw int alone is unusable |
| `gesturestart` / `gesturechange` / `gestureend` | `{scale, rotation, clientX, clientY}` | matches Safari GestureEvent |
| `change` / `input` (text) | `rawArgs[0]` is the string value, not an object | the synthetic-event shim treats `typeof === 'string'` as a change event |

### Required JS preamble shape

In `widget_bridge.cpp` the `kJSPreamble` and `kWindowListenerShim`
strings MUST guarantee:

- `__dispatch__(id, eventName, ...args)` wraps every callback in
  `try/catch` and surfaces failures via `__dispatchError__` if defined.
  Otherwise a single throwing handler kills the rAF self-rescheduling
  loop and the whole animation pipeline dies until the next event
  restarts it.
- When `id === '__global__'`, fan the dispatch out to
  `window._listeners[eventName]` so `window.addEventListener('keydown',
  fn)` works without the full web-compat bundle.
- `window` exposes `addEventListener` / `removeEventListener` /
  `dispatchEvent` and `_listeners` via the minimal shim — install AFTER
  all preludes so `var window = {...}` in `web-compat-document.js` does
  not clobber the shim.

### Native-side registrars MUST be idempotent

`registerPointer(id)` / `registerWheel(id)` (and any future
`registerX(id)`) wrap the previous `on_pointer_event` lambda. If a React
re-render re-issues the registration, each call stacks a new wrapper —
N renders → N firings per event. Always gate the registration with a
per-id set (e.g. `pointer_registered_`, `wheel_registered_`) and
early-return on duplicates.

### macOS host-side bubbling

`core/view/platform/mac/window_host_mac.mm` is the dispatch source for
mouse / pointer / wheel on macOS. Every dispatcher MUST:

- Set `me.window_position = pt` for wheel events (clientX/Y derives from
  this). Without it JSX `e.clientX - rect.left` for anchor-frequency
  zoom gives the wrong anchor.
- Bubble `on_pointer_event` up the parent chain (W3C bubbling) so a
  wrap-div with `registerPointer` subscribed gets events from canvas
  children that win `hit_test`. The Spectr FilterBank band-drawer is
  this exact pattern.
- Leave `on_mouse_down` / `on_mouse_drag` / `on_mouse_up` deepest-wins
  (those are the JUCE-style click channel, not the W3C bubbling channel).

### registerShortcut focus-guard

`WidgetBridge::forward_key_event` checks `registerShortcut` entries
before falling through to the W3C `__global__` keydown dispatch. To
prevent global bare-key shortcuts (`?` for cheatsheet, etc.) from
firing while the user types into a text input, the loop suppresses any
registered shortcut whose modifier mask has no
`kModCtrl|kModAlt|kModMeta|kModCmd` bit set, IF a text-accepting
widget currently has focus. Shift alone counts as bare (Shift only
picks the upper-case glyph). Modifier chords (`Cmd+S`, `Cmd+,`) always
fire — they are always-global by design and must work even when an
editor has focus.

The focus signal is `View::focused_input_` (the same static slot the
macOS PulpView already maintains for text-input dispatch)
**narrowed** by `View::accepts_text_input()`. The slot is populated
for ANY focusable widget — Knob, Button, ListBox, TextEditor — via the
window-host focus path, so checking just `focused_input_ != nullptr`
would wrongly kill bare-key shortcuts after clicking a knob. The virtual `accepts_text_input()` returns false by
default; only `TextEditor` (and any future text-input widget) overrides
to true.

Prereq for the default-shortcuts pass (`planning/2026-05-16-default-
keyboard-shortcuts.md`), which adds a bare-`?` cheatsheet binding to
imported designs.

### Tests that pin the contract

`test/test_widget_bridge.cpp` — `[contract]` tag:

- "Event contract: W3C MouseEvent.button maps left=0, middle=1, right=2"
- "Event contract: forward_key_event emits W3C UIEvent.key strings + modifier booleans"
- "Event contract: window.addEventListener('keydown', fn) receives __global__ keydown"
- "WidgetBridge focus-guard: bare-key shortcuts suppressed while text input focused"
- "Event contract: __dispatch__ try/catch keeps listeners alive after a handler throws"
- "Event contract: wheel dispatch is an object {deltaX,deltaY,clientX,clientY}"
- "Event contract: registerPointer/registerWheel are idempotent (no lambda-stack growth)"

Run with: `./build/test/pulp-test-widget-bridge "[contract]"`

When adding any new event family or fields, add a corresponding
`[contract]` case AND a row to the payload-shape table above.

### Test and validator runs must not open native editor hosts

Adapter editor creation is guarded by `PULP_DISABLE_PLUGIN_EDITOR`,
`PULP_HEADLESS`, `PULP_TEST_MODE`, and `CI`. Validator and agent-driven
test paths must set the explicit `PULP_*` variables so VST3 returns no
editor view, CLAP hides `CLAP_EXT_GUI`, AU v2 returns no Cocoa view, and
AUv3 avoids constructing `PluginViewHost`. Do not replace this with
post-hoc window cleanup; the contract is that no native editor host is
created in the first place.

## Keyboard-focus host etiquette — never hold the host's first responder when idle

A plugin editor embeds an `NSView` in the DAW's window. If that view returns
`acceptsFirstResponder = YES` unconditionally (or the plugin sets a *focusable
root* via `set_focusable(true)`), then **clicking any control makes the plugin
view the host window's first responder, and every keystroke routes into the
plugin** — stealing the host's keyboard. In Logic this silences **Musical
Typing** on software-instrument tracks the instant you touch a plugin control,
which masquerades perfectly as an audio failure ("adjusting the plugin kills the
instrument until I reopen it" — reopening just refocuses a host view). No crash,
no log; unaffected by any audio/parameter fix; happens only on instrument
tracks (audio tracks don't need keystrokes) and only via the plugin's own GUI
(the host's generic control view never moves focus out of the host). Cost ~2
days to find — see the `au-xpc-shared-process-crash` debug note.

Contract (`core/view/platform/mac/plugin_view_host_mac.mm`, both the CPU
`PulpPluginView` and GPU `PulpGpuPluginView` classes — shared by AU/VST3/CLAP):

- `acceptsFirstResponder` returns true **only while** `View::focused_input_`
  is set (a widget is in active text input), not unconditionally.
- After every `mouseDown:`/`mouseUp:`/`keyDown:`, call `syncKeyFocus`:
  `makeFirstResponder:self` when a widget wants keys; the instant it doesn't,
  **restore the host's PRIOR first responder** (saved at claim time), not
  nil — handing nil leaves Logic's key routing dead (Musical Typing stays
  silent after a type-in commit until the user resets the track). The saved
  pointer is never dereferenced: it is re-found *by identity* in the window's
  live view tree (`pulp_plugin_live_prior_responder`), so a freed responder
  degrades to nil instead of a dangling send (the file builds without ARC).
- **The host's grab wins**: `resignFirstResponder` must end the focused
  widget's text input (`pulp_plugin_end_text_input`: clear the slot, then
  `on_focus_changed(false)` so the widget commits/closes its type-in).
  Otherwise a type-in left open when the user clicks a host control keeps
  `acceptsFirstResponder` true and re-steals the keyboard on the next event.
  Widgets with type-in UIs should override `on_focus_changed(false)` to
  commit, exactly like a click-away inside the plugin.
- **Scope every focus decision to THIS editor's root.** `View::focused_input_`
  is a process-GLOBAL static, so with two plugin editors open in one host
  (two instances of the same plug-in is the common case) it can point into a
  *different* editor's tree. `acceptsFirstResponder`, `syncKeyFocus`, the
  keyDown dispatch, and the resignFirstResponder text-input teardown must all
  gate on `pulp_focus_under_root(self.rootView)` (focused view is `root` or a
  descendant — walk `View::parent()`), never on the bare global. Otherwise
  editor B accepts/steals the keyboard, or routes keys into editor A, while A
  holds a focused field. All four contracts (claim/restore, host-grab ends
  input, freed-prior-responder safety, per-editor scoping) are pinned by
  `test_plugin_view_host_key_focus.mm` (real `NSWindow` + responder dance,
  single- and two-editor, CPU host).
- Editors must NOT set a focusable ROOT. Claim focus per-field:
  `claim_input_focus()` in `enter_typein()`, `release_input_focus()` in
  `commit_typein()`/`cancel_typein()`. This is the JUCE default
  (`wantsKeyboardFocus = false`; grab only for an active text field).

## GPU view host auto-selection — never hardcode `use_gpu=false`

The format adapters (AU v2 / VST3 / CLAP / iOS AUv3) must NOT hand-set
`PluginViewHost::Options::use_gpu`. They call the shared decision helper
`pulp::format::decide_gpu_host(bridge)` (`core/format/include/pulp/format/gpu_host_select.hpp`),
which returns `use_gpu` = `bridge.uses_script_ui() || bridge.view()->requires_gpu_host()`,
honoring the `PULP_DISABLE_PLUGIN_GPU` runtime opt-out. Hardcoding
`use_gpu=false` is the exact trap that made a Skia/Dawn editor silently fall
back to the AutoUi CPU path (the GPU-plugin-view-host work, 2026-05).

Rules when touching an adapter's editor-attach path:
- A custom `Processor::create_view()` that owns a `ScriptedUiSession` MUST
  override `Processor::active_scripted_ui()` so `ViewBridge` reports
  `uses_script_ui()`, adapters log `mode=scripted`, select the GPU host, and
  `make_scripted_idle_pump` can poll that session. Chainer-style generated
  processors use this path.
- A custom non-scripted GPU view (WebGPU/Three.js canvas, hand-built Skia view)
  MUST call `view->set_requires_gpu_host(true)` on its root, or
  `decide_gpu_host` returns `mode=autoui` and it gets CPU. The framework
  scripted-UI root (`editor_ui.hpp`) already sets it.
- After `PluginViewHost::create(...)`, call
  `format::warn_if_unexpected_cpu_fallback(decision, host.get())` — it screams
  (`runtime::log_error`) if GPU was requested but the host fell back to CPU.
- Wire the per-vsync scripted pump: `host->set_idle_callback(make_scripted_idle_pump(bridge))`.
  Without it a JS UI paints its first frame but `requestAnimationFrame` /
  timers / async results never fire.
- `make_scripted_idle_pump` captures the `ViewBridge` by raw pointer, so the
  host MUST be destroyed before the bridge. In AU/VST3/CLAP the bridge is
  declared before the host (reverse-destruction → host first); keep that order.
- AU v2 has no host resize callback — use `host->set_resize_callback(...)` to
  forward native-NSView frame changes to `bridge->resize()`. VST3/CLAP drive
  resize through their own host size callbacks and don't need it.
- **Embedded plugin views route their own mouse input.** The mac plugin views
  (`PulpGpuPluginView` GPU + `PulpPluginView` CPU, in `plugin_view_host_mac.mm`)
  implement `mouseDown/Dragged/Up/scrollWheel` → `hit_test` → `on_mouse_event` +
  `on_mouse_down/drag/up` with W3C pointer/drag bubbling to ancestors and
  drag-target liveness, reusing the standalone window host's `mac_geometry`
  helpers. Without these the editor paints but swallows every click. They also
  set flexible `autoresizingMask` so they follow host editor-container resizes.
- **AU specifically also needs the Cocoa view advertised** (`kAudioUnitProperty_CocoaUI`)
  or the host shows its own generic param view regardless of the host wiring —
  see the `auv2` skill's "AU v2 MUST advertise its Cocoa view" gotcha.

See `planning/2026-05-22-gpu-view-host-in-plugins.md` and its `qa/` doc.

## The browser host — a fourth host, and the one with no plugin ABI

`core/view/platform/web/` adds `pulp::view::web::BrowserWindowHost`: the same
`core/view` widget tree, flex layout, text shaping, and Ink & Signal theme,
compiled to wasm and painted into a `<canvas>` by **Skia Ganesh on WebGL2**
(*not* Graphite/Dawn — see the `skia-gpu-build` skill's wasm section), driven by
a `requestAnimationFrame` render loop (`render_loop_emscripten.cpp`). DOM
pointer/key events are translated into View events by
`core/view/include/pulp/view/web/web_event_translate.hpp`.

What is different about it, and what to keep true:

- **There is no `ViewBridge` and no format adapter here.** The browser UI module
  is DSP-free and talks to the audio side only through the web player's
  `HostAdapter` seam, which is why the *same* wasm UI module mounts against both
  the WAM and the WebCLAP demo. Don't reach for the plugin editor lifecycle in
  web code; there is no `create_view()` → `open` → `notify_attached` protocol to
  participate in.
- **Probe, don't assume, GPU.** `pulp::view::web::browser_host_gpu_available()`
  is the web analogue of `decide_gpu_host` — a browser with no WebGL2 context is
  a real, shipping configuration. The mount path must **fail loudly and
  asynchronously** so the host page can fall back (the demo pages fall back to
  the player's generated parameter grid). A UI module that only fails
  asynchronously and reports nothing leaves an empty panel, which reads as a
  render bug.
- **Context loss is a normal event, not a crash.** WebGL contexts are lost and
  restored by the browser at will (tab backgrounding, GPU reset). The surface
  reports unavailable on loss, the rAF loop keeps pumping, and Ganesh is rebuilt
  and repaints on restore. Any new GPU resource cached above the surface must
  survive that cycle.

## `Processor` vtable growth is append-only

`Processor` is an ABI surface (`node_abi_gate`). New virtuals — most recently
`on_non_realtime_tick()` / `non_realtime_tick_pending()` — go at the **end** of
the class with a default implementation, never inserted between existing
virtuals, or every prebuilt SDK consumer's vtable offsets shift and you get the
silent-garbage failure mode the "Stale-Header ABI Mismatch" section above
describes. Both hooks default to no-ops precisely so that adding them changes
nothing for processors that don't opt in. (What the hooks *do*, and which formats
actually call them — CLAP does, including native CLAP; VST3/AU/standalone do
not — is documented in the `clap` skill.)

## Proportional resize with aspect lock — design viewport (2026-05)

`PluginViewHost` now mirrors `WindowHost`'s design-viewport contract
so DAW-embedded editors can corner-drag
proportionally without re-laying out. Three new virtuals on the host
(no-op defaults; full impl on the mac CPU + GPU hosts today):

- `set_design_viewport(design_w, design_h)` — pin root at design size;
  paint applies an aspect-correct scale + letterbox translate to fit
  the current host bounds.
- `set_fixed_aspect_ratio(ratio)` — API parity only; the host doesn't
  own the OS window, so DAWs enforce the aspect via per-format hints.
- `window_to_root_point(pt)` — inverse-map a host-space point into
  root coords; called by native event handlers (mouse hit-test on
  resized windows) AND tests.

Per-format wiring:

- **CLAP** — `gui_can_resize=true`; `gui_get_resize_hints` sets
  `preserve_aspect_ratio=true` and `aspect_ratio_{w,h}=design_{w,h}`;
  `gui_adjust_size` snaps to the design aspect, then clamps to
  plugin min/max; `gui_create` calls `host->set_design_viewport(...)`
  + `host->set_fixed_aspect_ratio(...)`.
- **VST3** — `canResize=kResultTrue`; `checkSizeConstraint` snaps to
  the design aspect; `onSize`'s existing `host->set_size(...)` path
  resizes surfaces; `attached()` (or first `onSize`) calls
  `host->set_design_viewport(...)`.
- **macOS AUv3** — no CLAP/VST3-style drag constraint callback.
  `PulpAUMacViewController` must create its initial root view at the
  compile-time design size when `PULP_PLUGIN_DESIGN_W/H` are available,
  then call `host->set_design_viewport(...)` after `ViewBridge` opens.
  `supportedViewConfigurations:` should return aspect-correct host
  configs first, but only if they are large enough for the design;
  wrong-aspect "large enough" configs are fallbacks. Undersized fixed-
  design configs should be rejected so CoreAudioKit can choose the
  largest available configuration. REAPER's in-process AUv3 path can
  still shrink the first live layout after attach, so the macOS
  controller has a one-shot initial size sync that expands the host
  window by the view delta and reapplies the design size before normal
  `viewDidLayout` resize takes over.
- **AU v2** — cannot offer this; the DAW resizes the returned NSView
  directly with no host-side resize-hint analogue.

Pitfall to remember: when wiring `gui_set_size` / `onSize`, do NOT
re-layout the view at the host window size when a design viewport is
active — the host's paint already applies the design transform, and a
window-sized layout would briefly flash before the next paint reset.

See `test_plugin_view_host_design_viewport.mm` for the wiring proof.

## GpuSurface Plumbing Into WidgetBridge

Adapter editor-attach paths that wire a scripted UI (`ScriptedUiSession`)
MUST hand the host's live `render::GpuSurface*` to the bridge so the
JS-side `navigator.gpu` / `canvas.getContext('webgpu')` shim routes
through Pulp's real Dawn instance. Without it, those shims fall through
to mocks and any JS-rendered WebGPU output (Three.js, raw WebGPU) is
black.

The order is fixed by the adapter editor lifecycle: `ViewBridge::open()`
constructs the `ScriptedUiSession` (and its `WidgetBridge`) BEFORE
`PluginViewHost::create()` allocates the `GpuSurface`. Two new API
points close that gap:

- `pulp::view::WidgetBridge::attach_gpu_surface(GpuSurface*)` — idempotent
  late-attach; nullable. Stores the pointer + lazily allocates the
  native GPU bridge state. Pair with `gpu_surface()` /
  `has_native_gpu_bridge()` for introspection / tests.
- `pulp::view::ScriptedUiSession::attach_gpu_surface(GpuSurface*)` —
  forwards to the active bridge AND stashes the pointer so any later
  hot-reload rebuild constructs the next bridge with the same surface.

Adapters call this after the host is built. Reference wiring in:

- `core/format/src/au_view_controller_ios.mm` (iOS AUv3)
- `core/format/src/au_view_controller_mac.mm` (macOS AUv3)
- `core/format/src/vst3_plug_view.cpp` (VST3)
- `core/format/src/au_v2_cocoa_view.mm` (AU v2)
- `core/format/include/pulp/format/clap_entry.hpp` (CLAP)

The expected log line on success:

```
[plugin-gpu-host] GpuSurface attached to WidgetBridge via ScriptedUiSession (<format>)
```

`PluginViewHost::gpu_surface()` is a new virtual mirroring
`WindowHost::gpu_surface()` (CPU hosts inherit the nullptr default; GPU
hosts on iOS/macOS override). Future Windows/Linux factory hosts that
want WebGPU JS plumbing must override the virtual too.

Coverage: `pulp-test-widget-bridge "[gpu-surface-plumbing]"` (ctor +
late-attach + idempotence + detach) and `pulp-test-scripted-ui
"[gpu-surface-plumbing]"` (session-level forwarding). A live-Dawn
counterpart should use the `[jsc][navigator-gpu][live]` test path when it lands.

See `planning/2026-05-29-ios-d3b-threejs-webgpu-program.md`
for the full rationale.

**Why this matters:** Without this plumbing, format adapters silently route
Three.js + WebGPU canvas calls to mock adapters in production plug-ins. Do not
bypass it — if you're writing a new format adapter or plugin host, route your
live `GpuSurface*` through `ScriptedUiSession::attach_gpu_surface()` (or
`WidgetBridge::attach_gpu_surface()` if you don't have a session yet).

**`presentable` flag**: `WidgetBridge`'s `__gpuCanvasConfigureImpl` and
`__gpuCanvasDescribeCurrentTextureImpl` both expose a `presentable` boolean to
JS. `true` iff `gpu_surface_->has_surface()` is true (i.e., the surface has a
real swapchain, not just an offscreen texture). Three.js draws to a
`presentable=false` canvas land in a silent offscreen render that's not
composited to the visible AUv3 editor. Always check this flag in any new GPU
bridge code path.

### Author callback exception containment

`ViewBridge` is the shared containment boundary for author editor callbacks.
Creation, size and scripted-session lookup, open, close, and resize return safe
defaults or no-op when author code throws. Format ABI callbacks must not bypass
this boundary. Parameter text and custom state have matching containment in
`parameter_text.hpp` and `plugin_state_io.cpp`.

- `core/format/include/pulp/format/view_bridge.hpp` — public API
- `core/format/include/pulp/format/gpu_host_select.hpp` — GPU host auto-select helper
- `core/format/src/view_bridge.cpp` — implementation
- `core/format/include/pulp/format/processor.hpp` — `create_view`,
  `view_size`, `on_view_*`
- `core/format/include/pulp/format/plugin_descriptor.hpp` — the `ViewSize`
  struct and `view_size_from_design(...)`. The editor *hooks* stay on
  `Processor`; only their value type lives here. `processor.hpp` includes this
  header, so plugins and adapters that include `processor.hpp` reach `ViewSize`
  unchanged — that include is the compatibility contract, not an incidental
  one. The same split moved `ProcessContext` to `process_context.hpp` and

## Plugin-contributed settings sections

`Processor::settings_sections()` lets a plugin surface its own Settings tabs (e.g. a model
picker) that the **host composes** alongside its host-owned Audio/MIDI tabs — keep device
selection a host concern (a plugin can't pick the audio device in a DAW; the host owns it),
while still giving one unified Settings panel. The standalone chrome
(`make_standalone_editor_chrome`) calls `processor.settings_sections()` and appends each via
`SettingsPanel::add_section(title, view)` after the Audio/MIDI tabs. Gotchas:

- The `Settings` tab (with Audio/MIDI) only exists when `StandaloneConfig::show_settings_tab`
  is true; that's also the gate for composing plugin sections. A plugin that wants its
  settings visible in the standalone must leave it on.
- Do NOT pull host audio settings down into the plugin editor — invert it: contribute the
  plugin's sections up. In a DAW the same `settings_sections()` show with no Audio/MIDI tab,
  automatically correct.
- `make_standalone_editor_chrome` accesses `StandaloneEditorChrome`'s private members via a
  `friend` declaration — if you change its signature, update the friend decl to match or it
  silently loses friendship and fails to compile on the private-member access.

## Headless screenshot captures native overlays

`StandaloneApp::run_with_editor`'s `--screenshot` path normally reads the host's
Skia back buffer (`capture_back_buffer_png`), which can't see an OS-composited
**native overlay** (a WebView child view). When the editor view hosts a native
overlay (`View::contains_native_overlay()`), the standalone now routes through
`pulp::view::capture_view()`, which calls the overlay's
`capture_native_overlay_png()` (e.g. `WebViewPanel::snapshot_png()` → WKWebView
takeSnapshot) so WebView editors are self-verifiable headlessly. A plain Skia UI
falls through to the back-buffer capture unchanged. See the `screenshot` skill.

## Standalone audio callback: size for the device's MAX block, NOT the nominal buffer

`StandaloneApp::start()` reads `audio_device_->buffer_size()` into
`config_.buffer_size` and it is tempting to size the processor + every scratch
buffer to that. **Don't.** The device's nominal buffer is not the largest block
the render callback can deliver: when the hardware sample rate differs from the
app's configured rate, CoreAudio (and other backends) splice in a resampler
(`AudioConverter…fillComplexBuffer` in the crash stack) that pulls the callback
in *variable, larger-than-nominal* blocks — up to the host's
`MaximumFramesPerSlice` (4096 by default on macOS). A user simply selecting an
output device at a different rate is enough to trigger it.

The 2026-06 symptom: a standalone SIGABRT on `com.apple.audio.IOThread.client`,
~85 min in, in `RealtimePitchTimeProcessor::process` →
`assert(num_samples <= config_.max_block)`. The processor had been
`prepare()`d for the nominal buffer; an oversized resampler pull blew the
assert (and, in NDEBUG, would have overflowed the pre-allocated scratch).

The contract (`core/format/src/standalone.cpp`, `start()` + the audio lambda):

- Compute `max_callback_block_ = std::max(config_.buffer_size, 4096)` once, and
  use it for `PrepareContext::max_buffer_size`, `test_buffer_`,
  `silence_buffer_`, and `output_probe_.prepare(...)` — every buffer the
  callback can write, sized to the MAX, not the nominal.
- Guard the callback head: if `ctx.buffer_size > max_callback_block_`, fill the
  output with silence, `log_error` once, and `return` — never let an
  over-max block reach `process()`. A backend that ignores
  `MaximumFramesPerSlice` degrades to a one-time warning, not a crash on a real
  user's machine.
- The silence early-return must STILL advance the transport clock
  (`transport_position_samples_.fetch_add(ctx.buffer_size, ...)` when
  `transport_playing`) before returning. The normal path advances after
  `process()`; an early `return` that skips it lags the transport position —
  and the MIDI timeline derived from it — by exactly the dropped frames.
- The member lives in `standalone.hpp` (`int max_callback_block_`). The audio
  device's `CallbackContext::buffer_size` is the *actual* frames this block
  (it can exceed the nominal), so the guard compares against it, not
  `config_.buffer_size`.

Rule of thumb for any RT host you write: prepare for the worst-case block the
backend may hand you, then assert/guard against anything larger. Nominal buffer
size is a hint, not a ceiling.

## Standalone audio-callback probe tap (Phase 5 observability harness)

`StandaloneApp`'s audio callback carries an optional realtime output-boundary
probe, gated behind the `PULP_ENABLE_AUDIO_PROBES` CMake option. The default is
ON for dev/example builds; release and SDK build paths pass
`-DPULP_ENABLE_AUDIO_PROBES=OFF` so shipped standalone artifacts do not export
the dev probe surface unless a developer opts in. When ON, `start()`
`prepare()`s `output_probe_` (the only place it allocates) and the callback
calls `output_probe_.analyze_output(...)` immediately after
`processor_->process(...)` — the "standalone processor-output boundary." This
is the first wired probe stage for "UI works, no sound" reports. Gotchas:

- It is NOT the input meter bridge. `input_meter_bridge_` is input-oriented and
  lacks the snapshot's stage/sequence/NaN/clip/silence fields. Don't conflate.
- The tap is fully `#if PULP_ENABLE_AUDIO_PROBES`-guarded; an OFF build links no
  `AudioProbe` symbols into `standalone.cpp.o` (verified by `nm`). If you touch
  the callback, keep the probe strictly inside that guard so OFF builds pay $0.
- The probe is RT-safe (scalar-only, no FFT/alloc/locks) — `pulp::audio::AudioProbe`.
  Do NOT model audio-thread work on `pulp::view::VisualizationBridge`, which runs
  STFT and returns `std::vector` in its callback (explicitly quarantined).

### Phase 6 — Audio Inspector tool window wired into the host

`run_with_editor()` opens a `pulp::view::AudioInspectorWindow` (a SEPARATE
floating window, sibling of the layout inspector — not a tab) that observes
`output_probe_`. It is created only when a real `WindowHost` exists, behind the
same `#if PULP_ENABLE_AUDIO_PROBES` guard. Wiring gotchas:

- **Key routing must not clobber the layout inspector.** The audio inspector's
  toggle (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+A) dispatches through a shell-owned `CommandRegistry`
  via `route_global_keys(window_root, registry)`, which writes
  `window_root.on_global_key`. The layout inspector (Cmd+I) uses
  `on_global_click` (`install_inspector_hooks`). Distinct hooks → they coexist;
  do not move either onto the other's hook.
- **Compose the idle callback, don't replace it.** `poll()` must run each tick
  to refresh meters; capture the existing `pre_screenshot_idle` and call it
  first, then `audio_inspector_->poll()` — clobbering `set_idle_callback` drops
  the scripted-ui / settings / overlay paint.
- **Open + live waveform are env-gated.** `PULP_AUDIO_INSPECTOR` shows the
  window AND makes `start()` size `output_probe_`'s capture ring (to
  `AudioWaveformView::kCapacity`); without it the probe stays summary-only (no
  waveform allocation). Headless `--screenshot` also writes the inspector's own
  surface to `<stem>.audio-inspector.png` when it is open.
- **Teardown order:** destroy the window before the `CommandRegistry` (its RAII
  handler removal targets a live registry) and before `output_probe_`.
- **Panel colors:** `canvas::Color` channels are floats in `[0,1]` — build panel
  colors with `Color::rgba8(r,g,b,a)`, NOT `Color{26,26,32,255}` brace-init,
  which Skia clamps to opaque white (the white-on-white panel bug).
- **The editor idle pump drains the param store (automation → widgets).**
  `make_scripted_idle_pump(bridge)` (in `gpu_host_select.hpp`, set as every
  format's `set_idle_callback`) calls `bridge.store().pump_listeners()` each
  vsync. This is what makes `bind_parameter`-bound widgets follow host
  automation playback / host-side edits: `ListenerThread::Main` store changes
  are queued (the adapter writes the store from the audio thread) and ONLY
  fire on `pump_listeners()` on the UI thread. Without this drain, bound
  widgets never move during playback. The idle callback also keeps the GPU
  host's frame loop alive (`has_idle`), so the pump runs even when nothing
  else is animating. A custom view that reads the store directly each frame
  (not via `bind_parameter`) instead needs `View::set_continuous_repaint(true)`.
- **A native `create_view()` sizes the host window from its own layout bounds.**
  In `ViewBridge::open`, when the editor is native (not a scripted UI) and the
  view reports non-zero `bounds()`, those bounds override the processor's
  `view_size()` hints (`preferred_width`/`preferred_height`). A native editor
  that lays itself out — but doesn't declare `DESIGN_WIDTH`/`DESIGN_HEIGHT` —
  would otherwise get the default window size, which can be narrower than the
  laid-out content, so the right column + edge padding fall off the window's
  right/bottom edge. Scripted UIs keep the processor-declared `view_size()`
  (their layout is driven from JS/Yoga, not C++ `bounds()`). This is SDK-level:
  every native editor is sized correctly without per-plugin hardcoding — do not
  reintroduce per-plugin window-size constants to work around clipped editors.

## In-DAW scripted-UI hot reload is opt-in (dev only)

The DAW editor paths (`au_view_controller_mac.mm`, `au_v2_cocoa_view.mm`,
`au_view_controller_ios.mm`) build the `ViewBridge` with
`.enable_hot_reload = pulp::format::dev_editor_hot_reload_enabled()` — a
header-inline helper in `view_bridge.hpp` that returns true only when the host's
environment sets `PULP_DEV_HOT_RELOAD=1` (or `t`/`T`/`y`/`Y`). Default is OFF: a
shipping plugin must never watch + reload scripted UI / `theme.json` from disk
inside a host. The standalone app (`standalone.cpp`) always enables it — it is
the dev tool. Editor polling runs every tick regardless; the flag only decides
whether the watcher acts. To use the in-DAW edit→see-it loop, export
`PULP_DEV_HOT_RELOAD=1` in the DAW's environment before launching it. (Live-swap
plan item 1.3.)

## Scripted UI joins a unified live-swap transaction (SwapUnit)

`ScriptedUiSwapUnit` (`core/format/include/pulp/format/reload/scripted_ui_swap_unit.hpp`)
adapts a `ScriptedUiSession` to the `SwapUnit` contract so a UI swap composes with
a DSP swap (`DspReloadSwapUnit`) under `apply_live_swap` — a content pack that
carries both UI and DSP applies as ONE transaction (item 1.8b/2.5b). Notes:
- The adapter is **path-based**: `to_stage()` captures `session.script_path()`,
  `apply` = `reload_from(new_script)`, `rollback` = `reload_from(prev_script)`.
  It reuses the public `reload_from` (last-good, state-preserving) — no new view
  API. The UX unit is ordered FIRST (cheap to re-apply); a later DSP failure rolls
  it back to the previous bundle.
- It lives in the FORMAT layer (format→view is the allowed direction; view never
  links format), in its own header so DSP-only users don't pull in view.
- Value-perfect widget-state restore across a rollback is a refinement (rollback
  re-runs the previous script; `reload_from`'s own snapshot/restore preserves
  matching widget values across the rebuild).

## Custom widgets carry their own reload state (item 1.4b)

`WidgetBridge` snapshots/restores BUILT-IN widget state by type across a scripted-
UI reload (knob/fader/range/toggle/checkbox/togglebutton scalar; combo/segmented
selection index; xy pad — `widget_bridge.cpp` `snapshot_values`/`restore_values`).
A CUSTOM widget (a `View` subclass) opts into carrying its OWN state by overriding
the `View` virtuals `save_reload_state(std::string&)` / `restore_reload_state(std::string_view)`
(default return false → existing widgets unaffected). The bridge calls them for
every widget in `widgets_` and stores the opaque blob in
`WidgetReloadSnapshot::custom_state` keyed by script id; restore hands the blob
back to the widget still living under that id (id/type change → no match, fail-
safe). Note: `widgets_` is populated by the JS `createX` registrars (built-ins
only today), so end-to-end coverage through a JS-created custom widget awaits a
custom-widget registration path — the `View` hook + bridge wiring are in place for
when one exists.

## Live editor reload (in-place rebuild on hot-swap) — 1.9

A hot-reload plugin whose logic hot-swaps its `create_view()` needs the OPEN
editor to rebuild in place — otherwise the DSP swaps live but the panel only
updates when the DAW re-instantiates the plugin (the symptom that surfaced this).
The mechanism is format-agnostic and driven by the shared idle pump:

- **Signal, don't marshal.** `Processor::supports_editor_reload()` +
  `editor_reload_generation()` (additive virtuals, defaults false/0).
  `ReloadableShell` overrides them; an atomic counter bumps on each successful
  swap (both `reload_now()` and the watcher). The editor **polls** the generation
  on its UI-thread tick — the reload fires on the control/watcher thread, so
  polling avoids cross-thread UI mutation. Don't wire `set_on_reloaded` straight
  into UI work.
- **Preserve the root object identity.** `PluginViewHost` captures `View& root`
  at `create()` — there is no replace-root API. So `ViewBridge::rebuild_primary_view()`
  TRANSPLANTS the fresh `create_view()` output (children + background) INTO the
  same root `View` the host still references, rather than swapping `view_`. A
  logic whose `create_view()` returns a custom `View` **subclass** with root-level
  paint gets children+bg refreshed but not the subclass identity (fine for the
  common container-root editor).
- **Repaint after rebuild.** The CPU (CoreGraphics) mac host only repaints on
  `setNeedsDisplay`, so `make_scripted_idle_pump` calls `View::request_repaint()`
  after a rebuild. Mutating the tree alone does NOT repaint on CPU.
- **One wiring point.** `make_scripted_idle_pump` (gpu_host_select.hpp) covers AU
  v2/v3, VST3, CLAP, and both the CPU CVDisplayLink tick and GPU display link.
  `set_idle_callback` reads "GPU only" in the base header, but the mac CPU host
  (plugin_view_host_mac.mm) runs it via its own CVDisplayLink — so the pump does
  tick on CPU editors.

Test: `test_view_bridge.cpp` `[reload]` cases — a reloadable stub rebuilds into
the same root object with new content/bg, is idempotent, and is inert for a normal
processor. `examples/hot-reload-morph` exercises it end-to-end.

## Standalone is a transport — it must derive the same playhead change flags

`StandaloneApp` synthesizes transport (tempo, time signature, `position_beats`
from the rolling sample clock, `is_playing` from the user's play/stop toggle), so
it *is* a host for the Processor running inside it. It must therefore populate the
same derived `ProcessContext` fields the VST3 / AU / CLAP adapters do:

```cpp
detail::derive_bar_from_beats(proc_ctx);
detail::compute_playhead_changes(proc_ctx, playhead_prev_);   // member snapshot
```

It previously hand-rolled the `bar` derivation and never computed the change
flags at all, so `tempo_changed` / `time_sig_changed` / `transport_changed` /
`transport_started` / `transport_jump` were permanently `false` in the standalone
build. A tempo-synced generator therefore behaved differently in standalone than
in the plugin builds — and standalone is exactly where such generators get
developed. `playhead_prev_` is touched only from the audio callback.

## `transport_started` fires on the play edge; `should_reset_dsp_state()` does not

`ProcessContext::should_reset_dsp_state()` is `reset_requested || transport_jump`.
Pressing play at a **parked** position does not move the playhead, so
`compute_playhead_changes()` correctly reports no jump — and therefore
`should_reset_dsp_state()` returns `false` on the block where the transport starts.

That is correct for delay/reverb tails (a start is not a discontinuity, and tails
must survive it) and catastrophic for anything with run-relative phase. A
tempo-synced clock, LFO, or step sequencer that keys its phase reset off
`should_reset_dsp_state()` resumes a stale free-running phase and emits every
backlogged event on the first block of playback — a **pulse burst on play**.

Use `ProcessContext::transport_started` instead. It is deliberately *not* folded
into `should_reset_dsp_state()`, because the two answer different questions:
"did the timeline jump?" versus "did a run begin?"

Two subtleties:
- A processor instantiated **while the transport is already rolling** has no
  previous block to diff against (`!snapshot.has_previous`), so
  `transport_started` is set from `is_playing` on that first block. Without this a
  clock sits dead until the user stops and restarts the transport.
- Better still, derive event positions from `position_beats` outright rather than
  from an accumulator. Then a start, a seek, and a loop wrap are the same case,
  and none of them can produce a burst.

## The StateStore must outlive the Processor

`Processor::state()` dereferences a pointer the host installs. A Processor may
follow it for its whole lifetime — from `process()`, from its destructor, and from
any worker thread that destructor is about to `join()`. So the host has to keep the
store alive until the Processor is gone.

In practice that is one rule about member order: **declare the `state::StateStore`
before the `std::unique_ptr<Processor>`.** Members are destroyed in reverse
declaration order, so the store then dies last. Every host in `core/format` had it
backwards until 2026-07; the effect is nothing at all for a Processor with no
threads, and a use-after-free on plug-in close for one with a background thread that
reads `state().get_value()` while the destructor walks to its `join()`.

It crashes only on close, only sometimes, and the DAW gets the blame. The regression
test is `test/test_store_lifetime.cpp`; it observes the store's destruction through a
sentinel owned by a parameter's `to_string` closure rather than reading freed memory
and hoping the result looks wrong.

A Processor should not *rely* on this either: a worker thread that reads the store on
every tick is one host away from the same crash. Publish what the thread needs to
atomics from `process()` instead.

## Native children under a design viewport, and the resize contract

Two coupled seams a native-editor (WebView) plugin depends on:

**1. Native-child geometry honors the viewport transform.** When a host paints under a
design viewport it scales+letterboxes Pulp widgets, but `NativeViewHost::compute_geometry`
produces frames in ROOT/design space. If those raw coords are pushed to the OS view, a
tree mixing Pulp widgets and a native child drifts by scale+letterbox on any off-size DAW
pane. The fix is a **forward** transform companion to `window_to_root_point`'s inverse:
`bool design_viewport_transform(float& sx,float& sy,float& tx,float& ty)` on both
`PluginViewHost` and `WindowHost` (default false = identity; overridden by the mac CPU/GPU
plugin hosts and the GPU window host — the CPU window host has no viewport, so false is
correct). **Do the transform in the WIDGET (`native_view_host.cpp`), never in the host
`attach_native_child_view`/`set_native_child_view_bounds` primitives** — other callers
(`hosted_editor_attachment.hpp`, `examples/webview-{palette,monaco}`, `test_web_view.cpp`)
already pass HOST-space coords and would double-transform. Introspection getters stay in
design space; `computed_child_frame_host()` exposes the transformed frame for tests. The
pushed-geometry cache stores HOST-space, so a host resize (which changes the scale)
invalidates it and re-pushes even when the design-space layout is unchanged. WKWebView
caveat: scaling the frame **reflows** web content (CSS px track the frame), it does not
zoom — a `pageZoom = s` parity hook is deferred, not wired.

**2. The resize contract.** `ViewSize::aspect_ratio==0` means "free drag within [min,max]".
VST3 (`vst3_plug_view.cpp`) + CLAP (`clap_entry.hpp`) must honor it, but the migration
hazard is that the default `view_size()` returns `{w,h,0,0,0,0}` → `aspect_ratio==0`, so a
naive read flips every hand-authored plugin to free-reflow. Rule: `resizable = min>0 on
both axes` (CLAP's shipped convention); `free = resizable && aspect_ratio==0`. min==0 keeps
today's viewport pin (and VST3 `canResize()` now returns false there, aligning with CLAP);
resizable+aspect>0 is unchanged (viewport+lock+snap); free ⇒ no viewport/lock, clamp
min/max only, no aspect snap. Tests live in `test/test_vst3_plugin_state.cpp` and
`test/test_clap_entry.cpp` (`[resize]`), plus fake-host viewport-transform cases in
`test/test_native_view_host.cpp` (`[viewport]`).

## Two ways to reach the host's parameters — wiring both DOUBLE-WRITES

A `DesignFrameView` can carry a user gesture to the host's parameter store by two
different routes, and they are **not** alternatives you can safely have both of:

- **The binder** (the original route): you wire `on_element_changed` and forward
  it into the parameter store yourself. This is what the existing embed path does.
- **The host-param surface** (`View::host_params()`): call `set_host_params(&s)`
  and `route_changes_to_host_params(true)`, and the view drives
  `begin_gesture` / `set_param` / `end_gesture` on the surface itself. The surface
  hides *which* parameter system is underneath, so one view runs unchanged against
  an embedding framework's parameter tree or Pulp's own StateStore.

**`on_element_changed` keeps firing when routing is on.** That is free for a
consumer that merely *observes* it — and a **double write** for one that *writes*
from it, which the binder does. Turn routing on without deleting the write side of
your handler and the host receives every value **and every gesture bracket**
twice: a doubled automation write and an unbalanced begin/end pair.

Routing is **OFF by default**, and that default is load-bearing — it is what keeps
every existing embed correct. Pick exactly one route per view:

- staying on the binder → leave routing off, change nothing;
- moving to the surface → turn routing on **and** drop the write side of
  `on_element_changed`, keeping it only for observation.

`test_host_param_surface.cpp` pins this deliberately: with both wired, one user
movement produces one surface write *and* one binder write. If that test ever
starts reporting a single write, the funnel has grown a dedupe and this advice is
stale.

Related: an element re-keyed at runtime with `set_element_param_key()` now
re-binds. It previously kept driving the parameter it was first bound to, so a
view that re-keyed on a preset change was quietly writing to the **wrong
parameter**.

### A DesignFrameView must be PULLED — `pump_listeners()` cannot reach it

The two host→UI channels are **not** the same mechanism, and the difference is
easy to miss:

- a `bind_parameter` widget **registers a store listener**, so
  `StateStore::pump_listeners()` pushes host automation into it;
- a `DesignFrameView` binds through the abstract `HostParamSurface` (so one view
  runs against JUCE APVTS / iPlug2 / StateStore) and therefore registers **no
  listener at all**. Nothing pushes to it. It has to be pulled with
  `sync_from_host_params()`.

The editor idle pump (`make_scripted_idle_pump`) drives both — `pump_listeners()`
and the bridge's private `sync_design_frames_from_host()`, which it reaches as a
`friend` — so every plugin editor gets both channels. The pull is deliberately
NOT public: the pump is its only production caller, and a view-side enrolment
registry could retire the tree walk without an API deprecation. Reach it from a
test via `ViewBridgeTestAccess`, not by widening the class. Embedding Pulp views
in your own host? Wiring only the pump's listener drain gives you a design whose
knobs drive the host but never follow it — call the view's public
`sync_from_host_params()` from your own tick.

The pull is **silent**: `set_element_value` writes the element directly and never
re-emits `on_element_changed`, so it cannot echo back into the surface. That is
what makes it safe to pull unconditionally on a tick even though routing is
auto-enabled for every bound imported design — do not "optimize" it into a
re-emit.

**Testing that property: assert zero writes, not "it converges."** A
settle/no-drift check over repeated pulls looks like the natural convergence
proof and is nearly worthless here — a discrete parameter quantizes a small echo
straight back onto the same option, so an echoing pull can touch the host every
single frame while the value never moves and the check stays green. (Verified by
injecting exactly that echo: the settle/drift sweep passed; only
`FakeHostParamSurface::set_calls == 0` caught it, 180 == 0.) The pull is a read
— assert it that way, across every element kind, since routing is on for all of
them. Equally, do not add a naive `last_norm` guard: display text is not pure
in `(key, norm)` (`ParamInfo::to_string` is a closure and `do_param_display_text`
is virtual), so a tempo-synced delay reformats `"500 ms"` → `"1/4"` with its value
unmoved, and a value-only guard would freeze that readout.

## Widget-bridge JS dispatch and CSS color parsing have one home each

**Dispatch:** all `__dispatch__` event emission goes through
`core/view/src/widget_bridge/bridge_dispatch.{hpp,cpp}` — one `safe_dispatch_eval` (the
alive-flag overload) plus `dispatch_event(alive, engine, id, event_name, payload_expr)`.
It ALWAYS routes the target id through `js_string_literal`. Do not hand-build
`"__dispatch__('" + id + "', ...)"` by string concatenation: that pattern was copy-pasted
across ~40 call sites with *inconsistent* escaping, so an id containing a quote or
backslash broke out of the JS string literal and the exception was silently swallowed by
the surrounding catch. New events call `dispatch_event`.

**CSS color:** the bridge's full CSS-Color-4 parser is
`parse_bridge_css_color(std::string_view)` in `widget_bridge/css_color.hpp` — deliberately
NOT named `parse_css_color`, because `css_gradient.hpp` already declares a *weaker*
`pulp::view::parse_css_color(const std::string&)` (hex/rgb/rgba/transparent only — no named
colors, no hsl). Naming them alike makes `std::string` call sites silently bind to the weaker
overload and regress named/hsl handling. Keep the names distinct until the two parsers are
deliberately converged.
