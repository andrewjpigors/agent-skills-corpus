# Paid Advertising: Master Skill

Platform-agnostic knowledge base for paid advertising. Covers strategy, metrics, optimization, competitive intelligence, and defensive techniques. Routes to platform-specific skills for execution.

## Iron Laws

### 0. MANDATORY: Read project context AND report the full account/BM roster first

If you are operating inside a project repo, BEFORE any action (including before clarifying questions):

1. READ `.maccing/growth/README.md` — the index of which vendors/accounts are live vs disposed.
2. ENUMERATE every account — never assume one. Glob the relevant vendor tree and read EVERY README found, not just the one the task names:
   - Meta uses `meta/<profile>/<bm>/...`: read EVERY `meta/*/README.md` (profiles), EVERY `meta/*/*/README.md` (BMs), and the channel READMEs under them (`meta/*/*/whatsapp/*/README.md`, `meta/*/*/ads/*/README.md`).
   - Other vendors: read EVERY `google-ads/*/README.md`, `tiktok-ads/*/README.md`, etc.
3. TELL the operator a roster of ALL accounts/BMs up front — one line each (vendor/profile · account/BM · status · tier/quality) — INCLUDING ones unrelated to the current task. Never silently narrow to a single BM/account.

These hold current state: account IDs, budgets, campaign history, template/quality status, pending actions. Skipping this means operating on stale assumptions and hiding live assets from the operator.

### 0b. Persist project state under a git-tracked `.maccing/growth/`

When operating inside a project repo, you MUST:

1. Keep all project growth state under `.maccing/growth/<vendor>/.../<account>/`.
2. Verify it is tracked: run `git check-ignore .maccing/`. If ignored, STOP and fix `.gitignore` — project growth memory must be versioned.
3. Commit new/changed `.maccing/growth/` files; never leave them as untracked scratch.
4. Keep ONLY secrets out of git — API keys/tokens via env vars referenced from a gitignored `.env*.local`. Everything else is tracked.

### 1. Orchestrator Role

```
THIS SKILL IS THE BRAIN. PLATFORM SKILLS ARE THE HANDS.
Strategy, metrics, and decisions happen HERE.
Execution happens in platform-specific skills.
```

**Routing:**
- Google Ads execution → `google-ads` skill (Scripts-first)
- TikTok Ads execution → `tiktok-ads` skill (API + MCP)
- Meta/Facebook/Instagram execution → `meta-ads` skill (Marketing API + CAPI + CTWA)
- WhatsApp message dispatch → `whatsapp` skill (Cloud API, templates, bulk sending)
- Meta platform substrate (BM, verification, account quality, classifier, asset isolation, disposable-BM, ban/appeal) → `meta` skill — **shared**, loaded first by both `meta-ads` and `whatsapp`
- YCloud BSP (dispatch console, campaigns, opt-out automation) → `ycloud` skill; YCloud v2 REST API → `ycloud-api` skill
- Other platforms → research + manual guidance

**Project data:** `.maccing/growth/<vendor>/<account>/` — each project has its own README + platform subdirectories (git-tracked per Iron Law 0b).

**Structure:**
```
.maccing/growth/
├── README.md                   # Which vendors/accounts are live vs disposed
├── google-ads/
│   └── <account>/
│       ├── README.md           # Account IDs, campaigns, history
│       └── scripts/            # Executed scripts for this account
├── tiktok-ads/
│   └── <account>/
│       └── README.md           # Pixel, account data, history
├── meta/
│   └── <profile>/              # antidetect profile (owns one or more BMs)
│       ├── README.md           # Profile-level: identity, proxy, account status
│       └── <bm>/
│           ├── README.md       # BM-level: identity, verification, ad accounts
│           ├── site/           # Brand site (BM-level asset)
│           └── whatsapp/
│               └── <number>/
│                   └── README.md   # WABA, BSP, templates, quality, metrics
```

### 2. Self-Improving Skill

After every session: add new benchmarks, update techniques, note new patterns, record what worked/failed.

### 3. Exact UI Paths for Manual Actions

```
WHEN GUIDING ANY MANUAL ACTION ON ANY PLATFORM, PROVIDE THE FULL CLICK PATH.
NEVER give vague directions. ALWAYS give the exact click sequence.
```

Every manual instruction MUST include:
- The exact sidebar/menu item to click first
- Every sub-menu, tab, and page element in sequence
- The exact button, toggle, or field to interact with
- The save/confirm action

**Format:** `Sidebar → Sub-menu → Page → Element → Action → Confirm`

**BAD:** "Go to conversions and disable page view"
**GOOD:** "Metas (sidebar) → Conversões → Resumo → clica em 'Visualização de página' → desmarca 'Usar como meta principal da conta' → Salvar"

This applies to ALL platforms (Google Ads, Meta, TikTok, LinkedIn, etc.) and ALL manual guidance.

### 4. Data Before Opinions

Never recommend changes without data. Read metrics first, diagnose second, prescribe third.

### 5. Kill Fast, Scale Slow

Kill underperforming campaigns within 72 hours. Scale winners by max 20% every 5-7 days.

### 6. Automation Discipline

Automation discipline (official-surface-first, antidetect browser, human-like): see `references/automation.md`.

### 7. Cost Discipline

Cost discipline (ledger-in-place, present-before-spend, always optimize): see `references/cost-tracking.md`.

## Intent → Reference Routing Table

**Rule:** Advertisers running 3+ platforms outperform single-platform by 25-35% (unverified benchmark).

**Starter stack:** Google Search (demand capture) + Meta (demand generation). Add TikTok or LinkedIn based on audience.

## Campaign Structure (2025-2026)

### STAGs Over SKAGs

SKAGs are obsolete. Use STAGs (Single Theme Ad Groups): 3-20 keywords grouped by intent theme. More data feeds Smart Bidding faster, lower management overhead.

Reserve SKAGs only for top 5-10 highest-revenue keywords where ad relevance control justifies fragmentation.

### Automation Landscape

| Feature | Platform | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Performance Max (PMax) | Google | Standard. Complement, don't replace Search |
| AI Max for Search | Google | Out of beta May 2025. Replaces DSA |
| Advantage+ Shopping | Meta | 70% YoY adoption growth. 9% lower CPA |
| Smart Bidding Exploration | Google | Active. Auto-explores new queries |
| ECPC | Google | Deprecated March 2025 |

### PMax Best Practices
- Asset groups by theme, not by SKU
- Audience signals: Customer Match lists, website visitors, YouTube engagers
- Campaign-level negative keywords (available since Jan 2025)
- Min threshold: 20-30 conversions/month per campaign
- Starting budget: $100-150/day for 4-6 weeks

## Bidding Strategies

### Google Ads Decision Tree

| Strategy | When | Data Needed | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Manual CPC | New campaign, <15 conv/mo | None | Time-intensive |
| Maximize Clicks | Traffic, no conversion data | None | Low |
| Maximize Conversions | Scale volume, flexible CPA | 15-20 conv/mo | Can overspend |
| Target CPA | Predictable cost per lead | 15-30 conv/mo | Limits volume |
| Target ROAS | E-commerce, varying values | 30-50 conv/mo | Can starve spend |
| Max Conversion Value | Revenue over volume | 30+ conv/mo | Similar to tROAS |

**Graduation path:** Manual CPC → Maximize Conversions → Target CPA/ROAS

**Key:** Switching from Target CPA to Target ROAS yields avg 14% more conversion value at similar ROAS.

### Meta Ads Bidding

| Strategy | When |
|---|---|
| Highest Volume | Maximize conversions, flexible CPA |
| Cost Cap | Need average CPA within range |
| ROAS Goal | Revenue-focused, strong CAPI signal |
| Minimum ROAS | Floor ROAS threshold (new late 2025) |

## Ad Copy Frameworks

### By Awareness Level

| Framework | Audience Stage | Structure |
|---|---|---|
| AIDA | Unaware/Problem-aware | Attention → Interest → Desire → Action |
| PAS | Problem-aware | Problem → Agitation → Solution |
| BAB | Solution-aware | Before → After → Bridge |
| Hook-Story-Offer | Any (video) | Pattern interrupt → Narrative → CTA |
| FAB | Product-aware | Features → Advantages → Benefits |

**PAS** is the most versatile. Agitation is the power step: don't skip it.

**Hook-Story-Offer** dominates TikTok and Meta video. First 3 seconds determine 80% of outcome.

**Hybrid approach:** PAS for hook, FAB for body, AIDA for close.

## Creative Testing

### Hierarchy (test in order, highest impact first)

1. **Concept** — Core angle/promise (2x-5x swings)
2. **Format** — Static vs video vs carousel vs UGC
3. **Hook** — First 1-3 seconds / headline
4. **Body/Visual** — Supporting content
5. **CTA** — Button text, offer framing

### Methodology
- Change ONE variable per test
- 95% confidence, minimum 7 days
- 1,000 conversions or 10,000+ impressions per variant for significance
- Use CTR as directional signal for creative tests; CPA/ROAS for concept-level decisions

### The 3-3-3 Framework
3 audiences x 3 creative concepts x 3 ad variations per concept.

### Creative Lifespan

| Platform | Professional | UGC |
|---|---|---|
| TikTok | 1-2 weeks | 7-14 days |
| Meta | 3-4 weeks | 2-3 weeks |
| LinkedIn | 6-8 weeks | 4-6 weeks |
| YouTube | 4-8 weeks | 3-4 weeks |

### Fatigue Signals

| Signal | Threshold | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Frequency | >2.5 (prospecting) | Immediate refresh |
| CTR decline | >20% drop over 7-14 days | Begin refresh |
| CPM increase | >50% while CTR flat | Algorithm deprioritizing |
| CVR drop | >15% week-over-week | Urgent refresh |

## Audience Segmentation

### By Intent Level

| Type | Intent | Best Use |
|---|---|---|
| Remarketing (cart abandon) | Highest | Conversion campaigns |
| Customer Match (CRM) | Very high | Upsell, retention, exclusions |
| In-market | High | Acquisition, bottom-funnel |
| Custom Intent (competitor URLs) | High | Acquisition |
| Lookalike/Similar | Medium | Scaled acquisition |
| Custom Affinity | Low-medium | Awareness |
| Broad Affinity | Low | Brand awareness only |

### Lookalike Best Practices
- Seed with top 10% by LTV, not all customers
- Use recent purchasers (last 90 days)
- 1% = most similar; 10% = broadest
- Result: +17% revenue per transaction, -20% CPA vs interest-based

### Customer Match
Upload hashed email + phone + name + zip. Google matches 40-60%. Use for upsell, exclusion from acquisition, and suppression from discount campaigns.

## Retargeting

### Funnel Stages

| Stage | Audience | Window | Frequency | Message |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TOFU | Content readers | 30-60 days | 5-7x/week | Educate, trust |
| MOFU | Product visitors | 14-30 days | 7-10x/week | Features, proof |
| BOFU | Cart abandoners | 7-14 days | 10-15x/week | Urgency, discount |
| Post-purchase | Buyers | 30-90 days | 2-3x/week | Upsell, referral |

### Critical Rules
- Exclude recent purchasers from acquisition campaigns
- Exclude BOFU from TOFU campaigns
- Exclude 30-day non-converters (fatigue)
- Sequential messaging > repetition (2-3x higher CVR)

## Budget Allocation

### By Growth Stage

| Stage | Testing | Scaling | Retargeting |
|---|---|---|---|
| Early (proving) | 50% | 30% | 20% |
| Growth (profitable) | 30% | 50% | 20% |
| Scale (optimizing) | 20% | 70-80% | 10-20% |

### Cross-Platform Split (benchmark)
- 40% Google Ads (high-intent)
- 35% Meta (awareness + retargeting)
- 25% Emerging channels (TikTok, LinkedIn, CTV)

### Kill Criteria

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Spent 2x target CPA, 0 conversions | Kill immediately |
| Spent 1.5x target CPA, 1 conversion | 24 more hours |
| CTR <1.0% after 1,000 impressions | Replace creative |
| No KPIs after 72 hours | Kill |

### Scaling Rules
- Max 20-30% budget increase per change
- Wait 5-7 days between increases
- For Target ROAS: lower target by 5-10% when scaling
- Horizontal scaling (new audiences/geos) > vertical (more budget into same)

## Attribution

### Current State (2025-2026)

Google removed First Click, Linear, Time Decay, Position-Based in Oct 2023. Choice is now:

| Model | How | When |
|---|---|---|
| Last Click | 100% to final touchpoint | <200 conv/month |
| Data-Driven (DDA) | ML-distributed credit | >200 conv/month |

**Critical warning:** Platform-native attribution is biased. Every platform over-credits itself. Always compare platform ROAS vs blended MER (total revenue / total ad spend).

TikTok is undervalued by last-click by up to 10.7x due to halo effect on Google search volume (vendor-claimed, not independently verified).

## Quality Score / Relevance

### Google Ads Quality Score (1-10)

| Component | Weight | What Matters |
|---|---|---|
| Expected CTR | Highest | Historical CTR |
| Ad Relevance | Medium | Copy matches query intent |
| Landing Page Experience | Medium | Speed, relevance, mobile, CTA |

**Impact:** QS 5→8+ reduces CPC by 30-50%.

### Meta Relevance Diagnostics

| Ranking | Measures |
|---|---|
| Quality Ranking | Perceived quality vs competitors |
| Engagement Rate | Expected engagement vs competitors |
| Conversion Rate | Expected CVR vs same-goal ads |

High relevance = lower CPM, better delivery, 5-12% cost reduction.

## Landing Page Optimization

### Above-the-Fold Requirements
1. Confirm visitor is in the right place (message match with ad)
2. State primary value proposition
3. Clear CTA

CTAs above the fold: +317% conversion lift (unverified benchmark).

### Speed Benchmarks
- Target: <2 seconds load
- 0.1s improvement = +10% conversions (travel), +8.4% (e-commerce)
- LCP <2.5s, INP <200ms, CLS <0.1

### Message Match
Ad headline and page H1 must use the same language. Disconnects are the #1 driver of Quality Score penalties.

## Conversion Tracking

### Server-Side is Mandatory

| Dimension | Client-Side (Pixel) | Server-Side (API) |
|---|---|---|
| Ad blocker impact | Blocked 15-40% | Bypassed |
| iOS restrictions | Degraded | Minimal impact |
| Data accuracy | 60-85% | Near 100% |
| Reported lift | Baseline | +10-34% more conversions |

**Run both in parallel with event deduplication via shared `event_id`.**

### Platform APIs

| Platform | Solution |
|---|---|
| Google | GA4 Measurement Protocol (server-side) + Enhanced Conversions + sGTM |
| Meta | Conversions API (CAPI) |
| TikTok | Events API |
| LinkedIn | Conversions API |

### GA4 Measurement Protocol
Server-side event tracking via GA4. Details and gotchas → `../google-ads/SKILL.md`.

### Consent Mode V2 (mandatory EEA/UK)
- Requires Google-certified CMP (Cookiebot, OneTrust, etc.)
- Recovers 30-50% of previously lost conversions via modeled fill
- Two signals: `ad_user_data` and `ad_personalization`

### Privacy Landscape
- iOS 14.5+ opted out majority of users from IDFA tracking
- Third-party cookies functionally unreliable (Safari ITP ~30% of browsers)
- First-party data is the imperative: email capture + CRM + Customer Match + sGTM

## Cross-Platform Funnel

### Sequencing

```
TikTok/Meta → Spark awareness, cultural resonance
YouTube → Deepen engagement, explain product
Google Search → Close high-intent traffic
Email/SMS → Retain and upsell
```

### Platform Funnel Roles

| Platform | Stage | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Google Search | Bottom | Purchase intent |
| Google PMax | Full | Automated all-inventory |
| YouTube | Mid/Upper | Video engagement |
| Meta | Mid/Upper | Interest + behavior |
| TikTok | Upper | Discovery + viral |
| LinkedIn | Mid | Professional intent |

## Emerging Trends (2025-2026)

- **AI-generated video ads:** 86% of ad buyers use GenAI for video. 40% of all video ads projected AI-generated by end 2026
- **CTV/OTT:** Digital video captures ~70% of US TV/video ad spend. QR-code CTV ads gaining traction
- **TikTok Search Ads:** 1 in 4 users searches within 30 seconds. +66% CTR, -33% CPA vs standard
- **Shoppable ads:** Buy without leaving app (IG, TikTok, YouTube product tags)
- **Value-based bidding:** Moving from "maximize conversions" to "maximize margin" using COGS-adjusted values
- **Retail Media Networks:** Amazon, Walmart building walled gardens on purchase data
- **AI Max:** Google's full automation replacing DSA. 7% more conversions at similar CPA
- **Broad match renaissance:** Broad match + Smart Bidding + strong conversion signal outperforms exact match in mature accounts

# Competitive Intelligence & Defensive Techniques

## Ad Cloaking (How It Works)

Cloaking shows one page to platform reviewers and a different page to real users. Understanding this is essential for detecting when competitors use it and for protecting your own campaigns from false comparisons.

### Architecture: Traffic Distribution Systems (TDS)

Every cloaking setup uses a TDS: an intermediary server that inspects each request and routes to either:
- **White page:** Clean, policy-compliant (shown to bots/reviewers)
- **Black page:** Actual offer/restricted content (shown to real users)

### Detection Signals Used by Cloakers

| Signal | How It Works |
|---|---|
| IP matching | Databases of Google/Meta corporate subnets. Platform IPs get white page |
| User-Agent | Known crawler UAs (Googlebot, facebookexternalhit) get white page |
| JavaScript fingerprint | Screen res, canvas, WebGL, timezone. Headless browsers fail checks |
| Referrer filtering | Clicks from known review tool domains get white page |
| Geolocation | Platform review team locations get white page |
| Behavioral analysis | Scroll depth, mouse movement, time-on-page. Crawlers don't interact |
| Click ID splitting | Presence/absence of gclid, fbclid routes differently |

### Domain Rotation
Operators maintain pools of domains. When one gets flagged, ads point to the next. Automation makes this near-instantaneous.

### Platform Detection Methods
- **Google:** Googlebot crawl + secondary automated systems + real browser review + AI pattern matching. "Circumventing Systems" policy = account suspension
- **Meta:** AI comparison of ad vs landing page + real-device farms with human operators + legal action against scam advertisers
- **TikTok:** Physical device farms with human operators. Less mature detection than Google/Meta

### Risks
- Immediate account ban
- Permanent domain blacklisting
- Payment method suspension
- Legal action (Meta has sued cloaking operators)
- Loss of all account history and Quality Scores

## Ad Policy Circumvention (Detection & Defense)

Competitors in restricted categories sometimes use circumvention techniques. Recognizing these patterns helps you detect unfair competition and protect your own accounts from false-positive policy violations.

### Common Circumvention Signals to Detect

| Signal | What It Indicates |
|---|---|
| Competitor landing page differs from ad copy | Possible bridge page / redirect chain in use |
| Competitor rotates domains frequently | Domain rotation strategy to evade bans |
| Ads from unknown agency accounts for regulated offers | White label abuse (getting restricted content approved via whitelisted accounts) |
| Compliant ads followed by sudden creative pivot | Account warming then switching to restricted content |

### Restricted Categories Most Commonly Targeted
Crypto/DeFi, gambling/casinos, pharma/supplements, make money online, adult content, payday loans.

Google removed 270.7 million gambling-related ads in 2025 alone.

### Protecting Your Own Accounts
- Keep landing page content fully consistent with ad copy — disconnects trigger automated policy review
- Never use redirect chains; direct URLs only
- Run compliant creative from launch; do not "warm" then switch
- If operating in a sensitive vertical, get legal review of landing page content before launch

## Click Fraud & Competitor Sabotage (Detection & Defense)

Click bombing — repeatedly clicking competitor ads to exhaust their budget — is real and common. **Scale:** 15-30% of all ad clicks in competitive markets are fraudulent. H1 2025 global ad fraud rate: 39.7% (unverified benchmark).

### Detection Signals in Your Own Campaigns

| Signal | Indicates |
|---|---|
| High CTR + near-zero conversions | Fraudulent clicks |
| Traffic spikes at unusual hours | Bot activity |
| Clicks concentrated in specific IP ranges | Click farm |
| CVR collapse with stable traffic | Invalid traffic |
| Homogeneous user-agent strings | Automation |

### Protection Tools

| Tool | Strengths |
|---|---|
| ClickCease | Easy setup, 2000+ behavior tests/visit |
| TrafficGuard | Prevention Mode (blocks before spend) |
| ClickPatrol | 4-pillar framework, anomaly detection |
| SpiderAF | Behavioral fingerprinting |

### Google Ads IP Exclusion
Exclude up to 500 IP addresses/ranges. Identify abusing IPs from Click Performance report.

## Gray Hat Techniques (Awareness)

Boundary-pushing conversion tactics (fake urgency, fake social proof, confirmshaming, misleading before/after imagery, fake chat widgets) are widespread in performance marketing and are used by competitors. Be aware they exist; platforms and regulators (FTC, ASA) are increasingly enforcing against them. Avoid them in your own campaigns — detection and enforcement risk is rising, and they erode long-term brand trust.

## Affiliate Fraud (Detection & Defense)

Affiliate fraud inflates reported conversions without real business value. Common fraud types to watch for: cookie stuffing (hidden pixel sets affiliate cookie without a real click — 60% of affiliate fraud), forced clicks (auto-redirects through tracking links), pixel stacking (hidden ad impressions), incentivized traffic (real humans paid to fill forms, passes bot detection), fake leads (synthetic identities), and postback manipulation (fabricated server-side conversion signals).

### Detection Methods
- Behavioral fingerprinting and session tracking
- Duplicate data detection (same email/phone across "unique" conversions)
- Geolocation mismatches (click origin vs conversion IP)
- Time-of-day analysis (bulk fills during off-hours)
- Cross-affiliate correlation
- Zero downstream intent: high opt-out, zero purchases, no email opens

## Counter-Measures Checklist

### Detecting Competitor Techniques Against You
1. Pull Click Performance report, filter by IP
2. Export raw session logs, identify high-frequency IPs
3. Cross-reference against datacenter/proxy CIDR blocks
4. Segment conversions by hour/device vs 4-week baseline
5. Check geographic anomalies in click origin vs target market
6. Monitor brand search volume for unexplained drops (competitor cloaking your brand terms)

### Monitoring Competitor Ads
- **Meta Ad Library:** Free, shows all active ads any account runs
- **Google Ads Transparency Center:** Public disclosure for Google ads
- **SpyFu, SEMrush, SimilarWeb:** Competitive PPC intelligence
- **AdSpy, BigSpy:** Ad creative tracking across networks

### Reporting Violations
- **Google:** Third Party Policy Violation Report Form or "Report this ad" button. 3 strikes = suspension
- **Meta:** Three-dot menu on any ad → Report
- **FTC (USA):** ReportFraud.ftc.gov for deceptive advertising

## Bot Traffic Reality (2025)

- 51%+ of internet traffic is automated
- 37% classified as malicious bots
- H1 2025 global ad fraud rate: 39.7%, peaked 49% in June (unverified benchmark)
- SlopAds scheme (disrupted 2025): peaked at 2.3 billion bid requests/day via hidden WebViews in Android apps

# Geo-Targeting & Emerging Markets

## Multi-Country Rules
- NEVER run a single global campaign. Separate by country/cluster + language + budget priority
- Geo-targeted campaigns: +20% higher CVR vs broad
- In bilingual markets (SE Asia), target native language AND English

## Regional Notes

### Southeast Asia
- Digital ad spend: $24.09bn (2025), 15% CAGR through 2031
- Mobile-first (70%+ time online is mobile)
- TikTok + Instagram dominant for discovery, Google Search for intent
- WhatsApp for communication (click-to-WhatsApp ads work well)

### Finance & Trading Keyword CPC Estimates for SEA (2025)

No public source publishes exact per-keyword CPC for "copy trading" / "earn money online" in SEA. Derived estimates based on industry multipliers:

| Keyword Category | Estimated CPC Range (SEA) | Notes |
|-----------------|--------------------------|-------|
| "earn money online" / "online jobs" | $0.05–$0.30 | High volume, low quality intent; attracts bots/signal seekers |
| "online trading" / "forex trading" | $0.40–$1.50 | Moderate competition in SEA |
| "copy trading" / "social trading" | $0.30–$1.20 | Lower competition than "forex" in SEA |
| "trading platform" | $0.50–$2.00 | Most competitive finance keyword |
| "invest online" / "investment app" | $0.30–$1.00 | Growing competition |

**Warning:** "earn money online" / "online jobs" keywords in SEA attract extremely high bot/click-farm traffic. Production campaigns (May 2026) confirm: high CTR, near-zero conversion quality. Heavy negatives required.

### Financial Services Google Ads Benchmarks (Global, Finance & Insurance Category — WordStream 2025)

These are the best available benchmarks. SEA CPCs are ~60–80% lower but CVR and quality patterns are similar:

| Metric | Finance & Insurance | All Industries Avg |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| CTR (Search) | 8.33% | 6.66% |
| CPC | $3.46 (US-anchored) | $5.26 |
| CVR | 2.55% | 7.52% |
| CPA (CPL) | $83.93 | $70.11 |

**Fintech specifically** (B2B fintech per LeverDigital/Varos 2025):
- CVR: 1.23%–2.8% (lower than general finance due to trust barriers)
- CPC: $3–$6 (US market; SEA equivalent: $0.50–$2.00 for trading keywords)
- CPA (free signup): $50–$150 (US); SEA equivalent: $3–$25 depending on keyword quality
- Target CVR for free signup funnel: 5%–10% (optimistic); realistic landing at 2%–4%

### CPA Estimates for Free Sign-Up Funnels in SEA (2025-2026)

Derived from CPC data × typical CVR:

| Country | CPC Range (trading kws) | CVR Estimate | Estimated CPA (sign-up) |
|---------|------------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| Philippines | $0.40–$0.80 | 3%–6% | $7–$27 |

Observed in production (a BR free-signup funnel): ~$6 BRL-equivalent CPA at low daily spend — confirms SEA CPAs of $5–$15 are achievable.

### Budget Testing Recommendations for SEA/South Asia (2025)

- **Minimum effective daily budget per country:** $10–$20/day (enough to exit learning phase at SEA CPCs)
- **To exit Smart Bidding learning phase:** Need 15–20 conversions in 30 days = budget must support that at target CPA
- **Multi-country testing stack:** Start with 3–4 markets, $15–$25/day each = $45–$100/day total
- **Proven allocation for 9-country test:**
  - Tier 1 (highest intent, lowest fraud): Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand → 40% of budget
  - Tier 2 (high volume, moderate quality): Indonesia, India → 35% of budget  
  - Tier 3 (test/watch): Vietnam, Bangladesh, Pakistan, South Korea → 25% of budget
- **30-day pilot budget to generate meaningful data:** $900–$1,500 total across 3–4 markets
- **South Korea caveat:** Google only ~30% search share. Naver (62%) requires separate platform + Korean-language creative. Budget accordingly if targeting KR seriously.

### Vietnam-Specific Insights (2025)

- **Ad blocker penetration: ~38%** of internet users block ads (among the highest in Asia)
- **Coc Coc browser** (18% market share, ~51% of local search) has built-in AdBlockPlus integration — Google Ads reach is significantly reduced
- **Google Search CTR on Coc Coc text ads:** 3–6% (comparable to Google when shown)
- **Implication:** Your Google Ads reach in Vietnam is probably 25–35% lower than raw impression numbers suggest. Factor this into CPM math.
- Search advertising is the #1 digital ad format in Vietnam (Google has >90% of search spend despite Coc Coc's browser share)
- Mobile-first: ~46% of internet traffic from smartphones
- Evening peak (8–11 PM local): 3x higher conversion rates vs daytime

### South Korea-Specific Insights (2025)

- **Naver: 62.86% search share** (up from 58% in 2024, reclaimed first place)
- **Google: ~29–31% search share** — still significant but minority
- **Google Ads CPC in Korea: 72% below US average** but this reflects limited competition, not low intent
- **Naver Ads CPC is HIGHER than Google** in Korea — bid-driven (no Quality Score), 10–15 ad spots per SERP
- **For finance/trading:** Google Ads in Korea reaches the younger, international-leaning demographic. Naver reaches the mass market. For copy trading targeting English-literate or internationally-aware Koreans, Google may outperform despite lower market share.
- **PIPA compliance:** Korea's Personal Information Protection Act restricts cross-border data transfers. Server-side tracking from Korean users may require local data handling.
- **Language:** Korean-language ads mandatory for Naver. Google ads can run in English but Korean creatives will outperform on CTR.
- **Minimum Naver CPC:** 70 KRW (~$0.054) — very low floor, but competitive keywords bid much higher.

### South Asia
- India: ~15% annual growth 2024-2029
- Low CPCs vs Western markets (ROI arbitrage)
- YouTube dominant (TikTok banned in India)
- Lightweight landing pages for tier-2/tier-3 cities (2G/feature phones)
- India finance Google Ads: CTR 4.5–7%, CPC ₹45 avg (~$0.54), CPL ₹500–1,500 (~$6–$18)

### Africa
- Mobile-first mandatory, low desktop penetration
- WhatsApp is dominant communication platform
- Extreme regional variation (South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya each different)
