  Adversarial second pass over a generated (and possibly human-edited) Guardrails
  task folder: per task, find the cheapest WRONG implementation that would pass all
  its guardrails. Use when the user says "review this task folder", "run guardrail
  review on <folder>", or after /plan-breakdown produces a draft. Read-only critique

# Guardrail Review

The plan-breakdown skill (and the human after it) decided what the guardrails are.
This skill attacks them. Its one question, asked per task:

> **"What is the cheapest action output that passes ALL these guardrails while not
> actually doing the task?"**

If such an output exists, that's a finding. An empty findings list backed by evidence
("attempted to game tasks 1–5 as follows; couldn't") is a valid outcome — don't pad.

## Procedure

### 1. Inventory
Read `guardrails.json`, every `task.json`, every action and guardrail file. Build the
DAG mentally. Run `guardrails validate <folder>` first — never hand-check what the
tool checks (schema, refs, cycles, zero-guardrail tasks, missing promptRunners).
Run `guardrails plan <folder>` to see the waves.

Then run `guardrails graph <folder> --check`. `diagram.md` is a deterministic
projection of the folder; the human and earlier passes edit guardrails between
breakdown and review, so a stale or missing diagram means the DAG changed since it
was drawn. Branch on the exit code:
- **exit 2** (stale or missing) → regenerate with `guardrails graph <folder>` and
  note in the Step 6 report that the diagram was refreshed to match the current folder.
- **exit 1** (a load/validate error) → do NOT regenerate; surface the error in the
  report — `--check` couldn't even load the plan, so the folder has a deeper problem.
- **exit 0** (fresh) → nothing to do.

While reading each guardrail script during this pass, flag any that pattern-match a
specific tool's PRINTED console output (a `Select-String`/regex on a build or test
tool's summary/error text) rather than just its exit code or a file it wrote — Step 2's
adversarial pass runs that tool once against the real workspace to check the pattern
against genuine output (see "Pattern-matching guardrail not verified against real
output" below). **Also flag every `.sh`/`.ps1`/`.py` guardrail that RENDERS or EXECUTES
the task's own output** (writes a throwaway workspace / rendered fixture, runs an
`--input-type`/`-e` block, parses `--json`) — Step 2's adversarial pass EXECUTES those
against hand-synthesized valid + invalid samples to prove the SCRIPT'S OWN correctness
(see "Script guardrail not smoke-tested against a valid + invalid sample" below, the
#302 probe — distinct from the #248 tool-output probe). Noting both candidate sets here
avoids re-reading every script during the pass.

**Waved plan? Review wave-by-wave (#254).** A plan is *waved* when it has no root `tasks/` and ≥1
`wave-NN-<slug>/` subdir (SSOT §14; plan-breakdown Step 9). Each wave is a **mini-plan** — its own
`preflights/`/`guardrails/`/`tasks/` and its own `PlanDefinitionHash`-keyed review marker. `guardrails
validate`/`plan`/`graph` are already wave-aware; run them on the whole plan as usual. Then run the
adversarial pass (§2) **per task WITHIN each wave**, and give **each wave's entry/exit gates the
four-folder treatment** (§2 "Four-folder gap" probe, applied at wave granularity). Two review modes:
- **Whole waved plan** — review every authored wave, wave by wave, then `guardrails mark-reviewed
  <folder>` (or per wave).
- **A single freshly-authored wave (the JIT flow)** — plan-breakdown's JIT staged mode authors a
  downstream wave AFTER its upstream ran (against the materialized integration worktree), so you review
  **just that wave**: `<folder>/wave-NN-<slug>` is a mini-plan folder — run the same adversarial pass on
  its tasks + entry/exit gates, then `guardrails mark-reviewed <folder>/wave-NN-<slug>`. Do the
  waved-specific probes below (the "#254 — waved plans" block in §2) in either mode.

### 2. Adversarial pass per task (the heart)
Role-play a lazy or wrong implementer. Concrete probes (mirror of the catalogue's
anti-pattern list — `.claude/skills/plan-breakdown/references/guardrail-catalogue.md`):

- **Tautology**: does any guardrail check something the action itself writes to
  satisfy it? (Action controls the evidence.)
- **Echo-judge**: does a prompt-judge read the action's claims (summary, report
  *about* the work) instead of the raw artifact?
- **Replay-the-action**: does a guardrail re-run the action's own command (a full
  `dotnet build; dotnet test`) when the postcondition is expressible from recorded
  output — a produced artifact or a runner-written TRX (`GUARDRAILS_ACTION_RESULT` /
  `_STDOUT`, SSOT §5.1)? If so, suggest **verify-recorded-action-result** (#9): assert the
  artifact / parse the TRX instead of replaying. (Counter-check: a replay is the HONEST
  gate when no recorded GOOD target carries the postcondition — don't flag it then.)
- **Action-exit-code tautology / echo-judge on action stdout**: does a guardrail test
  `GUARDRAILS_ACTION_RESULT.exitCode -ne 0` (a tautology — the recorded exit code is
  ALWAYS 0 at guardrail time; a non-zero action failed the attempt before guardrails ran),
  or grep `GUARDRAILS_ACTION_STDOUT` for the action's own success word (`"Passed!"`,
  `"Build succeeded"` — an echo-judge, also SDK-version-brittle)? Fix: read a
  runner-written structured result (TRX) or a produced artifact, never the self-report.
- **Hollow output assertion** (#73): for a terminal/e2e guardrail whose task claims a
  **non-empty quantity of output** (migration moved-count, items written, rows produced,
  entities created), does the assertion green-light a **zero/null** result? Tells: a
  keyword-presence regex `Assert.*\([^)]*(Moved|Written|Count|Entities)` (matches
  `Assert.Equal(0, writer.Count)`), a bare `Assert.NotNull(...)`, or an `exit 0` with no
  positive-value check. "It didn't error" / "the keyword is present" is a structural no-op for
  "did anything get produced?" — a run that moved ZERO entities passes. Fix: require a
  **strictly positive** value (`(>\s*0|>=\s*1|NotEmpty\s*\(|True\s*\([^)]*Count\s*>\s*0)`), or
  read the runner-recorded count / state key and assert `> 0`. (Catalogue → positive-effect /
  non-hollow assertion.) BLOCKER — a zero-effect run goes green.
- **Judge-where-deterministic-possible**: for every `.prompt.md` guardrail, name the
  deterministic archetype that could replace it, or confirm none can (the 4-question
  demotion gate).
- **Over-broad**: "all tests pass" anywhere except the terminal `<plan>/guardrails/` folder.
- **Missing / malformed positive-baseline (preflight) on a brownfield plan (#181)**: does the plan
  build onto **existing code that already has tests in the touched area** (a brownfield plan — it modifies
  project(s) with existing test coverage), yet carry **no `<plan>/preflights/01-baseline-<area>-tests-green`
  check**? Without it, a work task's `tests-pass` guardrail can fail from PRE-EXISTING breakage
  (misattributed → wasted retries → late `needsHuman`), and a new test's "red" is ambiguous
  (missing-behavior vs already-broken). Under the four-folder model the baseline is a **positive check FILE
  in the plan-root `<plan>/preflights/` folder** (a Full Flight Check evaluated once, before the DAG,
  against the starting repo) — NOT a no-op ROOT task. It runs the EXISTING area tests **via `--filter`**
  and asserts they PASS on the current code (area-scoped, deduped one-per-area, using the #179 re-emit
  form); it needs no `dependsOn` and no wired-in work-task edges (the preflight phase implicitly gates the
  whole DAG — "never build on red"). Check, if a baseline preflight IS present:
  - **(a) Targets only the PRE-EXISTING tests via `--filter`** — NOT the about-to-be-authored red tests
    (it runs before the DAG on the starting state — a baseline that would run a sibling `author-tests`
    task's failing tests is mis-scoped), and **NOT the whole suite/project**. A whole-project `dotnet test`
    in the preflight hits the #165/#176 compile-coupling trap (a mid-TDD project does not compile → false
    red no work task can fix). A whole-suite-scoped baseline is a **BLOCKER**.
  - **(b) It is a `<plan>/preflights/` FILE, not a task** — a lingering no-op ROOT baseline TASK (the
    retired `00-baseline-*` `exit 0`-action + `dependsOn:[]` model) is a finding: re-home it to the
    preflight folder. There is no action to no-op — the preflight file IS the verification.
  - **(c) Deduped one-per-area** — one preflight file per distinct touched test project, each scoped to its
    area, NOT one global whole-repo preflight.
  - **(d) Distinct from the terminal gate** (green START before the DAG via `<plan>/preflights/` vs green
    END on the merged HEAD via `<plan>/guardrails/` — a plan needs both).
  - **(e) The worth-it gate held** — target pre-exists, MODIFIES-not-creates, deterministic + cheap (a
    bounded, filtered command — a filtered `dotnet test` is fine; no live-service boot/poll), strictly
    narrower than the terminal gate, ≥2 work tasks build on the area.
  The inverse error: a **vacuous baseline on a GREENFIELD plan** (a `dotnet test` over a project with zero
  tests, which trivially passes) — it certifies nothing while looking like a gate; greenfield must have NO
  baseline preflight. A RED baseline preflight halts the run before the DAG (the general Full-Flight-Check
  semantics), and #179 (re-emit form) makes its WHY reach the halt feedback. The negative "not yet present"
  baseline is NOT a separate archetype — it already IS `tests-fail-on-current-code`/`tests-fail-on-stubs`
  (do not expect, or flag the absence of, a parallel "negative preflight" archetype; when emitted at plan
  level it is likewise a `<plan>/preflights/` assert-absent check). **WEAK** when the area is plausibly
  green at the start and only the baseline is missing; **BLOCKER** when there is concrete reason the area's
  existing tests are already red (every work task then mis-fails), or when a present baseline is
  whole-suite-scoped or is a lingering no-op ROOT task. (Catalogue → "Baseline-green / start-from-green
  (preflight)"; `stacks/dotnet.md §21`. plan-breakdown Step 5 adds the matching insertion rule.)
- **Coverage gap**: the action's stated completion criteria exceed what guardrails
  verify — name the unverified criterion. (E.g. action says "sorted by category";
  no guardrail checks sorting.)
- **Stale coverage check (#157)**: the inverse of the coverage gap — here a
  `covers-key-behaviors` guardrail requires MORE than the action prompt asks for, so a
  CORRECT implementation following the prompt can never satisfy it. For every
  `covers-key-behaviors` guardrail (one `if ($content -match "<token>")` / `-notmatch …
  exit 1` per behavior, or a `$hits -lt N` threshold), verify each required token is named —
  directly or via an obvious synonym — somewhere in the SAME task's action prompt. A token
  the guardrail's `match` requires but the prompt's scenario list does NOT mention →
  **BLOCKER** with the message: "guardrail requires `<token>` but action prompt does not
  mention it — the task will fail every attempt." (Mechanism: the implementation follows the
  prompt, the guardrail keeps demanding the removed token, every attempt gets contradictory
  "need `<token>`" retry feedback and the task dead-ends at `needsHuman`.) This is the
  **human-judgement complement** to the deterministic **GR2026** warning `guardrails validate`
  already emits (SSOT §4.4): the lint is a conservative keyword-presence heuristic (it stays
  silent on a synonym or a regex-shaped token); the reviewer resolves the cases the lint can't
  — confirm a flagged token really is stale (the prompt dropped the scenario) vs named only via
  a synonym (a false positive to clear), and catch a stale token the lint skipped because it was
  regex-shaped. Cross-check `validate`'s GR2026 output against this pass; don't merely re-report it.
- **Tests gameable**: implementation tasks whose tests can be edited by the same
  action — the implementation task's `writeScope` must EXCLUDE the test files its
  upstream test-author task owns (the deterministic write-scope test-exclusion, SSOT
  §3.4), so an edit to a test file fails the harness's read-only write-scope check. An
  implementation task with no `writeScope`, or one whose scope covers the test files, is
  gameable. Inserted test tasks missing the TDD "red" guardrail for their type (#155): a
  BEHAVIORAL-type test-author task missing the `build-passes` + `tests-fail-on-stubs` pair
  (a lone non-zero-exit red passes on a non-compiling garbage test file — BLOCKER); a
  data-model task split without a structural `[Fact]`/`[Theory]` covers-key-behaviors check.
- **Missing scope-boundary warning (#154)**: for any test-author task (`author-tests-*` / a
  task whose deliverable is a test file), check that `action.prompt.md` contains an explicit
  **harness-enforcement paragraph** — it must name the allowed path(s) (test file AND, under
  #155, any stub file the `writeScope` covers), the post-action `git diff` membership check,
  the retry consequence of an out-of-scope edit, and the `{"needsHuman": …}` redirect for an
  upstream missing-symbol compile error. Absence is a **WEAK** finding — the harness injects
  `writeScope` at run time, but without the consequence the agent may still drift on a compile
  error and fix a neighbouring file (an out-of-scope edit that burns a retry). Fix: add the
  Scope boundary paragraph (plan-breakdown Step 6 has the verbatim shape).
- **Missing `.claude/` `needsHarnessWrite` instruction (#313)**: for any PROMPT task whose primary
  deliverable is a file under `.claude/` (`.claude/skills/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/hooks/`,
  `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/contexts/` — NEW or EXISTING file), check that `action.prompt.md`
  carries the `needsHarnessWrite` escape-hatch instruction — and that it is the STRAIGHT-TO-HATCH
  form: the agent is told to emit `{"needsHarnessWrite": …}` to the state-out path FIRST, WITHOUT a
  direct `Write`/`Edit` probe to the `.claude/` path (plan-breakdown Step 5b has the verbatim shape;
  the older reactive "if a direct write is refused, then emit …" phrasing is stale — a probe wastes a
  turn and, per #321, populates the permission-wall tracker). A Claude Code subprocess CANNOT write
  under `.claude/` — the tool-permission layer refuses it unconditionally (SSOT §9.3; the old
  `.claude/settings.json` grant is dead per #273), so a prompt that writes the file directly hits the
  wall on attempt 1 and the task dead-ends at `needs-human` before any guardrail runs. Absence is a
  **BLOCKER** — unlike the #154 scope-boundary paragraph (WEAK, a *risk* of drift), this is a *certain*
  dead-end: the wall is structural and deterministic, so the task as authored cannot complete
  autonomously. This is the doctrine gap that let the original `dfd-threagile` breakdown pass review
  and then hit the wall at run time. Fix: inject the verbatim straight-to-hatch `needsHarnessWrite`
  header (Step 5b). **Exemptions (not a finding):** a SCRIPT action writing `.claude/` (the harness
  runs it directly, off the tool-permission layer), and a task that declares `stagingOutputs` for its
  `.claude/` deliverable (it writes a staging path, not `.claude/` directly — SSOT §3.5).
  **Carve-out (#321) — a DIFFERENT finding:** a task whose primary deliverable IS a permission-granting
  settings file (`.claude/settings.json` / `.claude/settings.local.json`) cannot use `needsHarnessWrite`
  at all — the harness REJECTS writing those on an agent's behalf (a human must author them). Do NOT
  flag it for a missing header; flag it as needing a **human author** for that deliverable.
- **Unactionable failures**: guardrails that fail without printing a usable reason
  (retry feedback quality).
- **Failure detail lost to the tail (#179)**: for every guardrail that asserts a test suite
  **PASSES** (a `tests-pass` / `all-tests-pass` / `specific-tests-pass`, or a test driving a
  production seam), check it **re-emits the failure DETAIL at the END of stdout**. The harness
  feeds back only the **tail** of a failed guardrail's stdout (last ~60 lines / 4000 chars); default
  `dotnet test` prints each failure's assertion/exception text mid-run and ends with only
  `[FAIL] <name>` + a count. A bare `dotnet test … ; if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { Write-Output "…";
  exit 1 }` therefore tails out the test NAMES only — the next attempt sees WHAT failed, not WHY,
  and retries blind (plan-0009 burned 12 attempts to `needsHuman`). Tell: no
  `Select-String`/re-emit of failure-signal lines (`Error Message:`, `Assert.`, `Exception`,
  `Expected:`, `Actual:`) after the `dotnet test` call. Fix: the capture → emit-full-log →
  re-emit-at-the-end pattern (catalogue → "Failure detail must reach the retry tail";
  `stacks/dotnet.md §4.2`). **WEAK** (the run still passes/fails correctly; it degrades retry
  feedback, costing attempts). Do NOT flag the INVERSE `tests-fail-on-stubs` /
  `tests-fail-on-current-code` checks — a non-zero exit is their success, so there is no failure
  detail to feed back.
- **Grep-scope contamination**: a file-content guardrail that greps the project tree
  (`Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Select-String`) instead of the one file the task owns — a
  same-wave sibling sharing the term can satisfy it. (Catalogue anti-pattern.)
- **Keyword-not-structural**: an "implements/extends/declares" check matching a bare
  type name (`Select-String "IFoo"`) that a comment, `using`, or local copy satisfies —
  it should match the declaration construct (stack file's structural regex). Also flag an
  **accessor-order-sensitive** structural regex (#112): a property "declared/removed" check
  keyed on a fixed leading accessor — `\{\s*get` or `\{\s*set` (e.g.
  `public\s+\S+\s+NAME\s*\{\s*get`) — is **itself a finding**. C# accessor order is free
  (`{ get; init; }` ≡ `{ init; get; }`), so it **false-passes a removal check** when the field
  survives as `{ init; get; }` (an incomplete refactor ships green) and **false-fails a declared
  check** symmetrically. Fix: match up to the brace (`public\s+TYPE\s+NAME\s*\{`),
  order-insensitive; if accessor presence matters, test `(get|set|init)` anywhere inside the
  block. (Catalogue → member-order insensitivity; `stacks/dotnet.md §3.1`.) BLOCKER on a
  removal check — a lingering field reads as gone.
- **Comment-blind forbidden-keyword scan (#97, #98)**: a guardrail that scans a **source file**
  for **banned** constructs (read-only `MERGE`/`EXEC`/`xp_cmdshell`, no-shell, no-eval,
  no-`console.log`) by matching the **raw file including comments** — `Get-Content $f -Raw` then
  a banned-keyword `-match` with no comment-stripping. It false-POSITIVES on a comment, a string
  literal, or disabled code that *names* the banned thing. The poison case to hunt: the **same
  task** both (a) tells the action to write a **safety-header comment** naming the banned constructs
  AND (b) greps for them without stripping comments — a guaranteed false positive that whack-a-moles
  a CORRECT read-only artifact to `needs-human` (each retry strips one mention, exposes the next).
  Tell: a `Get-Content -Raw` keyword check on a source file with no `/* */` + `--` (or `//`) strip
  upstream of the match. Fix: strip the source language's comments before matching (blank-in-place
  for line-number-reporting checks); and don't pair a header-documenting prompt with a comment-blind
  grep. BLOCKER — a correct implementation fails permanently. (Catalogue → comment-blind keyword
  scan; `stacks/dotnet.md §11`.)
- **Hollow / incomplete derived corpus (#99)**: a task whose deliverable is **derived artifacts
  over a set of inputs** (doc mining, codegen-from-spec, crawl→one-output-per-page, dataset import)
  whose guardrails verify only **shape** — `file-exists` + a marker line — so a green run ships an
  **empty or partial** corpus (worse than a hard failure: it looks done). Three tells: a one-line
  **stub** passes a marker check (F1); an **index** naming only 1 of N outputs "resolves" (F2); a
  crawl capturing **2 of N** pages passes because the checks verify "what I listed exists," never "I
  listed enough" (F3 — look for guardrails iterating the *outputs* rather than the *inputs*). Fix:
  require the four completeness/substance guardrails — input→output coverage, per-output substance
  floor (anti-stub), index completeness (`produced ⊆ indexed`), ingestion lower bound. Name them as
  **lower bounds**, not faithfulness checks (the semantic residual is a human pass or a
  demotion-gated judge — never a judge alone). BLOCKER — a green run ships a hollow/partial corpus.
  (Catalogue → corpus / aggregation completeness.)
- **Terminal-postcondition at integration scope (#125)**: a `scope:"integration"` guardrail that
  asserts a **terminal postcondition** — "the final combined output exists", "the sink wrote its
  aggregate", "all N contributors present" — instead of a **union-safe invariant**. Per SSOT §4.3
  the integration set re-runs at **every** union point (every fan-in / non-FF integration, §5.3 case
  B), on partial merges where downstream tasks have **not run yet** — so a terminal postcondition
  spuriously fails at an intermediate union and escalates a healthy partial merge to `needs-human`
  (surfaced live by `parallel-hello`). Decision test per integration guardrail: *"would this pass on
  a partial merge with a downstream task unsettled?"* Evaluate that test against **every union point
  that can occur anywhere in the plan before the guardrail's own task has run** — not only unions
  structurally upstream of that task in the DAG. `scope:"integration"` re-verifies at every fan-in
  **plan-wide** (SSOT §4.3, "no per-task or per-colliding-sibling guardrail selection at a union"), so
  a merge by a **completely unrelated parallel sibling** counts just as much as one that feeds the
  guardrail's own ancestor chain. "Does a union feed into MY task's ancestors?" is the too-narrow
  version of this question, and it will miss exactly that case — two siblings with zero dependency on
  the guardrail's task, each merging back onto the plan branch before that task has even started
  (#250: this is precisely what happened to a composition-root wiring guardrail live in review — see
  the catalogue's composition-root section for the matching gotcha). If **no**, it is a terminal
  postcondition wearing an integration scope. Fix: keep the integration gate to an invariant true of
  any valid intermediate union ("any produced file present is non-empty + conflict-marker-free"); move
  the terminal assertion to a `local` guardrail on the sink (runs in-attempt on the sink's segment).
  BLOCKER on a parallel plan with unions — it spuriously red-halts a correct run. (Catalogue →
  union-safe integration section; SSOT §4.3/§5.3.)
- **Overlapping writeScopes with no integration union-guardrail (#132)**: when **two or more tasks
  have OVERLAPPING `writeScope`s on a shared file/path** (colliding siblings that can both write the
  same file — AI-merge territory at the union), verify **at least one** `scope:"integration"` guardrail
  (on the integration / fan-in task) asserts the **UNION invariant** on that shared file. The v1 union
  re-verify runs the **integration set ONLY** (SSOT §4.3) — it does NOT re-run a colliding sibling's
  per-attempt `local` guardrails (running them at the union false-fails: fragment-readers checking
  `GUARDRAILS_STATE_FRAGMENT`, anti-tautology `tests-fail-on-current-code`, not-yet-run tasks). So a
  hunk an AI-merge silently DROPS on the shared file is re-verified at the union **only** by an
  integration-scoped guardrail; a drop catchable solely by a sibling's `local` guardrail is NOT
  re-verified there (it surfaces at the terminal gate, or not at all). If **no** `scope:"integration"`
  guardrail asserts the shared-file union invariant → emit a finding **WEAK**: recommend adding one
  (as the texttools showcase does with `components-union-verified` — assert the merged shared file
  still holds every sibling's contribution, union-safe per #125). This is an **authoring nudge**, not a
  harness bug: the integration-set-only union re-verify is an accepted v1 design (#132). (Catalogue →
  overlapping-writeScope union-guardrail; SSOT §4.3 "Accepted residual".)
  - **Duplicate-definition sub-check on a shared CODE file (#175)**: tighten the above when the shared
    overlapping-`writeScope` file is a CODE file and **both** colliding tasks could ADD a type/member
    DEFINITION to it (each writes a `class`/`record`/`interface`/`enum`/method the other doesn't). A
    3-way / AI-merge of two branches that each appended the SAME new definition to **different** regions
    of the file produces **no textual conflict marker** — git keeps both copies — so a conflict-marker
    check passes while the merged file holds a **duplicate definition** (the CS0101 that red-halted
    plan-0009's terminal gate, #175). Require the `scope:"integration"` union-guardrail to carry a
    **duplicate-definition count check** for each definition both siblings could add — count occurrences
    and fail when **>1** (`[regex]::Matches($content,'class\s+<Name>').Count -gt 1` in .NET), naming the
    AI-merge duplicate. Keep it union-safe/conditional (#165) — run it only inside the existing
    file-present gate, so it passes trivially at a union where the file hasn't landed. A conflict-marker /
    contribution-present union-guardrail with **no** duplicate-definition count on a shared code file two
    tasks both define into → **WEAK** (the silent semantic-duplicate residual the harness can only
    *attribute* at the gate, not prevent, SSOT §3.3). (Catalogue → overlapping-writeScope union-guardrail;
    `stacks/dotnet.md §19`; SSOT §3.3 / §4.3 "Accepted residual".)
- **Union guardrail ancestor staleness (#159)**: for every `scope:"integration"` union guardrail on a
  fan-in / integration task, identify each **expected-contribution token** (the string it
  `match`/`notmatch`-checks for in the shared file), and for each token identify which task(s) would
  **produce** it (the task whose action / `writeScope` writes that marker). Then verify every producing
  task is in the **ancestor set** of the integration task — there is a directed path producer → fan-in in
  the DAG. If a producing task is NOT an ancestor — a **disconnected leaf** or a **side branch** with no
  path to the fan-in — flag it **WEAK**: "Union guardrail checks for `<token>` contributed by task
  `<N>`, but task `<N>` is not an ancestor of the integration task. If task `<N>` is later removed, this
  guardrail will fail spuriously. Either add a DAG edge (`<N>` → fan-in task) to make the dependency
  explicit, or remove the `<token>` check from the union guardrail." The trap is silent: a disconnected
  producer **still runs** (the harness executes every task), so the guardrail passes **today** — but the
  integration gate now **implicitly requires** a task no edge declares it depends on, and the day that
  task is deferred/removed the gate red-halts with a confusing "shared file is missing `<token>`" that
  reads as a merge failure but is a **stale guardrail**. This is the run-time-fragility analogue of the
  #132 nudge above — there the residual is a dropped hunk on a shared file; here it is a contribution
  check whose producer fell out of the ancestor set. (Relates to #132/#125; the plan-breakdown side adds
  the matching rule on dependency-edge removal, Step 4.)
- **Unregistered module**: a task adds a module/project to a build descriptor (`.csproj`
  → `.slnx`) but no guardrail checks the DESCRIPTOR names it — a descriptor build passes
  with the project unregistered. (Stack file → build-descriptor registration.)
- **Unreferenced abstraction**: a task creates an abstraction a later task must consume,
  but no guardrail checks the consumer's project file has a `<ProjectReference>` — builds
  pass independently, so a local copy of the interface slips through. (Stack file →
  cross-module reference.)
- **Built-but-unwired component (#120 — the recurring lesson)**: the plan adds an `IFoo`/`FooImpl`
  pair (or any collaborator a production assembler must construct + inject), the component tasks
  build + unit-test it through an injected constructor seam — but **no task constructs `FooImpl` and
  injects it at the production composition root** (factory / `Program.cs` / DI / `RunCommand`), and
  **no guardrail drives the REAL assembler with the new mode active**. Every check is green while the
  feature is inert (reachable only from xUnit, which injects the seam itself); the terminal
  whole-suite gate does NOT cover this. Also flag the inverse: a wiring guardrail that **constructs +
  injects `FooImpl` itself** then asserts it works — it proves the component, never the wiring; the
  guardrail must go through the production assembler (drive the real factory + assert observable
  output, or reflect on the constructed object for the non-null collaborator with a contrast case —
  the `Factory_Wires*` shape). Missing wiring task OR a seam-injecting guardrail OR reliance on
  whole-suite green to cover wiring = BLOCKER. (Catalogue → composition-root section, `stacks/dotnet.md §10`.)
- **Wrong-implementation swap (#158)**: the next failure past #120 — given the dispatch IS wired,
  is the **right concrete type paired with the right mode**? For a dispatch / wiring task that routes
  **≥2 enum (or discriminated) values to ≥2 concrete types** AND whose dispatch tests use
  **seam-injection** (`RecordingImporter` / `FakeHandler` patterns that replace the real impl via DI and
  assert only that *an* importer was called), verify a **per-pairing proximity check** exists — one
  guardrail per pairing asserting `<EnumValue>` sits within a bounded window (`[\s\S]{0,300}`,
  multiline-dotall, both orders) of `<ConcreteType>` in the dispatch file. The swap to hunt: an agent
  routes Mode B → the wrong importer and Mode C → the other; the **build passes** (either type satisfies
  the interface in either branch), the **seam-injected dispatch tests pass** (they never check which
  concrete type was registered), and a **bare keyword check** that all enum values AND all type names
  appear *somewhere* passes too (all present regardless of pairing) — the feature ships inverted on a
  fully green suite. Flag **WEAK if the per-pairing check is missing**; **BLOCKER if the only concrete
  check is `tests-pass` with seam-injection tests** (nothing binds enum to type, so a swap is fully
  invisible). **Do NOT flag** when the dispatch tests already assert the concrete TYPE NAME
  (`Assert.IsType<TcApiLocalImporter>` on the resolved object) — the test catches the swap and the
  proximity check is redundant (the catalogue's decision gate). Distinct from #120 (built-but-unwired):
  there nothing wires the impl at all; here it is wired but possibly to the wrong mode. (Catalogue →
  "Dispatch / factory wiring"; `stacks/dotnet.md §10d`; relates to #120.)
- **Vacuous `writeScope`**: a task declares `writeScope: ["**"]`, a bare top-level dir, or
  any over-broad surface that owns everything — the write-scope check (SSOT §3.4) then
  discriminates nothing and is theater (`validate` warns GR2020). The honest move is to omit
  `writeScope` entirely (reported as a broad surface) rather than emit a vacuous one. Flag
  every `**`/over-broad scope as WEAK and propose either a real surface or omission.
- **Tests not excluded from an implementation scope**: an implementation task with an
  upstream test-author task whose own `writeScope` covers (or fails to exclude) those test
  files — the deterministic "implementation may not write the tests" boundary is open, so the
  implementation can edit the tests to force a tests-pass guardrail green. The implementation
  task's `writeScope` must EXCLUDE every test file the test-author task owns. (BLOCKER — it is
  the TDD test-protection gate.)
- **Missing `writeScope` where one is needed**: a task with a clearly bounded surface (a TDD
  test-author or implementation task, or any task touching one project/file) that omits
  `writeScope` entirely — it gets NO write-scope check, so an out-of-scope escape (including
  an implementation editing the tests) goes uncaught. Omission is correct ONLY for a genuinely
  repo-wide task (a terminal whole-suite gate, a sweeping cross-cutting change); flag a
  confidently-scopable task with no `writeScope` as WEAK and name the surface it should declare.
- **Four-folder gap — missing/empty/tautological plan-level or task-level folder (deliverable 9)**:
  the terminal integration-gate TASK (`integrationGate: true`) is **RETIRED** — a plan still
  declaring it gets a **hard validation error (GR2029)**, no coexistence window. The replacement
  is four first-class folders at fixed locations (SSOT §1/§3.3): plan-level `<plan>/preflights/`
  ("Full Flight Checks", evaluated once BEFORE the DAG against the starting repo) and
  `<plan>/guardrails/` ("Terminal Gate", evaluated once on the merged HEAD AFTER the DAG drains
  green) — both siblings of `tasks/`, `guardrails.json`, `state/` at the **plan root** — plus
  task-level `tasks/<id>/preflights/` (JIT dependency-delivery, a sibling of the existing
  `tasks/<id>/guardrails/`, evaluated per task BEFORE its attempt loop). Probe each folder the
  plan's shape requires and treat a required-but-missing folder/check as a **BLOCKER**:
  - **Missing or empty terminal folder on a multi-leaf/fan-in plan** — `<plan>/guardrails/`
    absent, or present with zero guardrail files, on a plan with ≥2 leaf tasks or any fan-in task
    → **BLOCKER**. `validate` already enforces this in worktree mode (GR2028); call it out with
    the concrete leaf/fan-in shape that triggers the obligation.
  - **Tautological terminal folder (the re-homed GR2018 obligation)** — `<plan>/guardrails/`
    present and non-empty but every file is a no-op (`exit 0`, a bare `echo`, a comment that only
    NAMES a build command, a prompt-judge with nothing to verify) rather than **≥1 real
    integration-set re-run** — a genuine whole-repo build/test/suite invocation (`dotnet test`,
    `dotnet build`, `npm test`, `pytest`, `cargo test`, …) or a union invariant → **BLOCKER**. A
    folder that merely EXISTS or merely contains a file certifies nothing; GR2018's content teeth
    survive the move from task to folder — "non-empty" is not the bar, "re-runs the integration
    set" is.
  - **A lingering `integrationGate: true` task** — flag it and point the author at the
    `<plan>/guardrails/` folder replacement; do not accept a plan whose terminal check still
    depends on the retired sink kind. (The one narrow exception: a plan's own committed,
    documented bootstrap exemption for a harness version that predates the loader — name it
    explicitly if the plan claims one, don't accept it silently.)
  - **Missing plan-level preflight on a brownfield plan** — the existing-tests-green positive
    baseline now lives as a `<plan>/preflights/` **positive** check (not a no-op ROOT task); its
    absence on a brownfield plan is the same WEAK→BLOCKER call as the baseline probe above (§2),
    just relocated to the folder.
  - **Missing task-level preflight where a `dependsOn` edge delivers a JIT dependency** — a
    consumer task that depends on a producer for a type/route/symbol/artifact it needs inside its
    OWN segment worktree at `taskBase`, with no `tasks/<id>/preflights/` check confirming the
    producer's contribution actually landed before the attempt loop spends a turn building against
    possibly-absent bytes → **WEAK** (flag **BLOCKER** when the delivery is genuinely uncertain —
    e.g. the producer is a same-wave sibling rather than a settled ancestor).
  - `scope: "integration"` itself is **UNCHANGED** — it remains the per-union tag driving the
    §4.3 per-union re-verify; only the *terminal-sink task* is retired. Do not flag a
    `scope: "integration"` guardrail elsewhere in the DAG as if it were the retired mechanism.
- **Live-probe used where a flake-free check would do — ADVISORY WARN, never a BLOCK (deliverable
  9)**: a check placed in ANY of the four folders that reaches outside the committed bytes under
  review — a network call, a polling loop, a spawned daemon/live service, anything whose outcome
  depends on more than the repo's own build/test tooling — trades determinism for **flake risk**.
  This is **authoring guidance the review emits as a WARN, never a BLOCKER**; the harness itself
  enforces NOTHING here — `guardrails validate`/`run` neither warns nor blocks on a live probe —
  so do not escalate this past a WARN no matter how bad the probe looks.
  - **Plan-level (`<plan>/preflights/` / `<plan>/guardrails/`)**: a full `dotnet test` /
    `dotnet build` over the committed bytes (the starting repo for preflights, the merged HEAD for
    guardrails) is **FINE** — that IS the canonical Full Flight Check / Terminal Gate shape, not a
    live probe. WARN only on a network/poll/daemon/live-service call there — a flake halts the
    **entire run** (plan-level has the maximal blast radius).
  - **Task-level (`tasks/<id>/preflights/`, and `tasks/<id>/guardrails/` by the same logic)**:
    **prefer** a byte/exit check (file exists, grep, a build/test scoped to the task's segment);
    WARN on a network/poll probe here too — smaller blast radius than plan-level (blocks one cone,
    not the whole run) but still a flake risk this early in the attempt loop.
  - The property under review is **FLAKE-FREEDOM, not process-count** — a `dotnet test` is a
    process start and stays fine; the WARN targets non-repeatable outcomes (network, timing,
    external services), not process spawning itself.

- **Integration gate missing or empty**: in a plan with ≥2 leaf tasks or any fan-in, confirm
  **exactly one** task declares `integrationGate: true` (the terminal whole-repo sink, SSOT
  §3.3) and that sink carries **at least one** `scope: "integration"` guardrail — an empty gate
  verifies nothing. Zero gates on a multi-leaf/fan-in plan, two-or-more gates, or a gate with no
  integration-scoped guardrail is a BLOCKER (`validate` enforces GR2017/GR2018, but call it out
  with the missing/empty sink named).
- **Full build / whole suite marked `scope: "integration"` on the terminal gate (#165 — BLOCKER)**:
  a **whole-repo build** (`dotnet build <solution>`) or **full test suite** (`dotnet test` with no
  filter) guardrail on the terminal integration gate that declares `scope: "integration"` is the
  **#125 terminal-postcondition anti-pattern**. The integration set re-runs at EVERY union point
  (SSOT §4.3), and a full build/suite is a **terminal postcondition**, not a union-safe invariant: at
  an intermediate union in a TDD plan the merged bytes contain test files referencing types whose
  implementation task has not run yet, so the build/suite FAILS there and the harness rolls the whole
  wave back — even though every per-task guardrail passed (decision test: *"would this pass on a
  partial merge with a downstream task unsettled?"* — a full build/suite answers **no**). Flag it
  **BLOCKER** (it red-halts correct intermediate unions). Fix: drop the `scope` key (make the full
  build/suite **LOCAL** — it then runs only at the terminal gate's own attempt, the correct moment),
  and ensure the gate still carries a separate `scope: "integration"` **union-safe** guardrail to
  satisfy GR2018 (next check). (Catalogue → "A `scope:"integration"` guardrail MUST be UNION-SAFE";
  SSOT §4.3/§5.3.)
- **Terminal gate's integration-scoped guardrail not union-safe / missing (#165, GR2018 — BLOCKER)**:
  the gate sink must carry **≥1** `scope: "integration"` guardrail (GR2018), and that guardrail must
  be a **union-safe CONDITIONAL invariant** — conflict-marker-free / non-empty, or "IF contribution X
  is present, verify it's real" (gate-then-verify), so it passes trivially before a contributing task
  has run. The full build/suite does NOT qualify (previous check). If the gate's ONLY
  integration-scoped guardrail is the build/suite, or its union guardrail is written **unconditionally**
  (`if ($content -notmatch "<token>") { exit 1 }` — requires a contribution that a partial merge may
  not hold yet), flag **BLOCKER**: it either leaves the gate with no real union coverage or red-halts
  a healthy partial merge. Fix: author a conditional union invariant (the `parallel-hello`
  `01-whole-repo-greeting` template; the overlapping-writeScope union-guardrail, #132). (Catalogue →
  union-safe CONDITIONAL form; SSOT §4.3.)
- **Over-scoped task (#111 — is this too coarse to land in one session / retry cheaply?)**: a task
  trips the plan-breakdown Step 2 split-trigger — (a) it bundles multiple distinct deliverables
  ("do X **and** Y **and** Z"); (b) it has a wide blast radius (deletes ≥3 source files, or
  touches ≳10 files / test references in one action); (c) it maps 1:1 to a design milestone / phase;
  or (d) a single failed-guardrail retry re-runs an hour of work (a multi-deletion, a 100+-ref
  re-baseline). An over-scoped task thrashes at run time — every guardrail miss re-runs the whole
  oversized action — and is the most likely `needs-human` in a run. Flag it WEAK (its retry is
  expensive; it is mis-sized) and propose the split: name the deliverables it bundles and the
  smaller tasks they should become, each with its test re-baseline scoped to that piece. This is the
  inverse of the missing-insertion check (§4): there a deliverable maps to NO task; here ONE task
  carries too many deliverables.
<!-- BEGIN ADDED PROBES #74/#75/#76/#96 -->
- **Keyword-not-structural for a METHOD CALL (#76)**: a "file calls `B.Method()`" guardrail that greps a
  **bare method name** — `RunAsync\s*\(` — passes on a comment (`// RunAsync(scope)`), a **local stub**
  of the same name (`private void RunAsync(...)`), or any unrelated same-named method, none of which
  invoke the real library method. The call-site sibling of the keyword-not-structural type/member trap.
  Fix: require **two sequential checks** — the **type** is referenced (`MigrationRunner`, rules out a
  local stub) AND the **dotted call** (`\.RunAsync\s*\(`, rules out comments + standalone definitions).
  Apply to any "task A must call `B.Method()`" on a specific type in another project. (Catalogue →
  method-call anchoring; `stacks/dotnet.md §15`.) BLOCKER on a wiring guardrail — a local/commented stub
  reads as wired.
- **Library bypasses its injected interface (#74)**: a task extracts a library that must write
  **through** an injected `IInterface`; it is registered + builds + tests pass — but **no guardrail checks
  the library's internals don't call the CONCRETE method directly**, bypassing the abstraction. Tell: an
  "extract … must go through `IInterface`" / "must NOT call `X` directly" task with only registration +
  build + tests-pass guardrails and no forbidden-direct-call scan of the library folder. Fix: a
  comment-stripped (#97/#98), dot-anchored (#76) forbidden-call scan of the **library project's `.cs`
  only** (exclude `bin`/`obj`). Also flag the inverse mistake: a **bare-name** bypass grep with no
  comment-strip — it *false-REDs* a correct library on a comment (whack-a-mole to `needs-human`).
  (Catalogue → no-direct-bypass; `stacks/dotnet.md §16`.) BLOCKER — a bypass ships green.
- **Enumerated behaviors unverified (#75)**: a test-author task whose action prompt lists **≥3 named
  behaviors** to encode but whose guardrails are only `tests-exist` + `tests-fail-on-current-code` —
  neither verifies the named behaviors are present, so **one** trivially-failing stub satisfies both
  while behaviors 2–N are never encoded (the coverage-gap anti-pattern, made concrete). Fix: a
  `covers-key-behaviors` check for **2–3 distinctive terms** (domain type / enum / method name — never
  generic words) from the list, **scoped to the one test file**; name it a **lower bound** (a term
  present ≠ the behavior asserted) and report which enumerated behaviors went unchecked. (Catalogue →
  covers-key-behaviors; `stacks/dotnet.md §17`.) WEAK→BLOCKER depending on how load-bearing the
  unverified behaviors are (it is the coverage-gap probe, sharpened for enumerated lists).
- **Name-convention seam unverified (#96)**: task A produces artifacts a consumer (task B / a runtime
  component) resolves by a **derived or mapped name** (url→embedded resource, step id→filename, key→file,
  route→handler, message-type→schema) — and `file-exists`/`file-contains` on A plus content checks on B
  both pass while the **naming contract is never exercised**. B derives a name A never produced (case /
  separator / single special-case drift) and **404s/silently-falls-back at runtime** on a 100%-green
  suite — invisible until the first real run. Tell: a derived-name consumer (fetch-by-name,
  embedded-resource/reflection lookup, convention file-map, route resolution) with only per-side
  file-exists/content checks and **no end-to-end lookup over the whole set**. Fix: a **consumer-driven
  integration guardrail** on a **both-sides-present** task that **parses the consumer's real map** (never
  a hard-coded contract copy), drives the lookup for **every** item, and asserts **200 + a per-item
  marker** (not a fallback body); `scope:"integration"` and **union-safe** (#125 — "every present
  artifact resolves"). Also flag the weak forms: a **sampled** check (not every item — the drift hides in
  the one special case) and a **hard-coded name list** in the test (a copy hides a consumer-side drift).
  (Catalogue → name-convention seam; `stacks/dotnet.md §18`.) BLOCKER on a UI/transport/convention-heavy
  plan — the failure is invisible to the whole suite.

<!-- BEGIN ADDED PROBES #176 — transitive compilation dependency · negative-assertion gap -->
- **Transitive compilation dependency — a test-author ancestor references a non-ancestor's type (#176)**:
  the §3 "missing edge" check applied at the IMPLICIT COMPILATION level, not just the direct-artifact
  level. For **each** task **B** whose verification step runs `dotnet build` / `dotnet test` (it compiles a
  test project): identify B's ancestor **test-author** tasks (ancestors that write `.cs` test files — those
  files are in the test project B compiles). For each such test file, consider the types its **action
  prompt's scenarios / deliverables ALLOW it to reference** (the enumerated scenarios, the named
  collaborators — not every type imaginable). If any of those types is **PRODUCED by an implementation task
  C that is NOT in B's ancestor set**, flag the **missing edge B←C**. The decision rule, stated verbatim:
  *"Task B's verification compiles the output of ancestor test-author task A. A's prompt allows referencing
  types produced by task C. C is not in B's ancestor set → missing edge B←C (add `C` to B's `dependsOn`, or
  the agent will be trapped — it can't fix a compile error in a file outside its writeScope, and may
  compensate by redefining the type in its own scope → a duplicate-definition merge collision)."* This is
  the exact failure chain of plan-0009: task 09's `dotnet test --filter` compiled the test project holding
  task 08's `MigrateDispatchTests.cs`, which referenced `CommanderRestImporter` produced by task 07 — and 07
  was NOT in 09's ancestor set, so 09 hit an unfixable compile error and redefined the class in its own
  writeScope (`Launcher.cs`), colliding with 07's copy at the AI-merge (CS0101, #175/#174). Severity: **WEAK**
  when the trap merely risks a wasted retry / `needsHuman`; **BLOCKER** when the test file's scenarios
  plainly reference the non-ancestor type (the compile failure is certain). Fix: add the producing
  implementation task to B's `dependsOn` so its output is present in B's working tree. (Distinct from the
  direct-artifact missing-edge check, §3 — there B reads C's FILE; here B COMPILES a file that references
  C's TYPE.) (plan-breakdown Step 3 adds the matching authoring rule.)
- **Negative-assertion gap — a prompt excludes a scenario but no guardrail forbids it (#176)**: when a
  task's action prompt **EXPLICITLY EXCLUDES** a scenario/keyword ("Mode C / `CommanderRest` is
  wizard-blocked — do NOT include it in the dispatch tests"; "the importer must NOT call `X` directly"),
  the corresponding guardrail must carry a **NEGATIVE assertion** verifying the excluded keyword is
  **ABSENT** — `if ($content -match "CommanderRest") { Write-Output "…"; exit 1 }` (fail-on-present).
  Without it, the agent is free to include the removed scenario **undetected**: the positive
  `covers-key-behaviors` only checks PRESENCE of the kept scenarios, so a stray excluded scenario sails
  through (exactly what slipped past plan-0009's task 08 and fed the #176 compile trap). For every
  test-author / implementation task whose prompt names an excluded scenario, confirm a fail-on-present
  guardrail exists for that keyword; if absent, flag **WEAK** (the exclusion is unenforced) — **BLOCKER**
  when the excluded scenario is the very thing that traps a downstream compile (the #176 case). Fix: add a
  fail-on-present negative-assertion guardrail (catalogue → negative assertion; `stacks/dotnet.md §20`),
  paired with the positive `covers-key-behaviors`. Note it is **correct** that `guardrails validate`'s
  GR2026 stays SILENT on this guardrail's keyword (post-#177 GR2026 flags only POSITIVE require-present
  coverage tokens, SSOT §4.4) — a GR2026 warning on a negative assertion would be the #177 false positive,
  not a signal to remove the guardrail. (plan-breakdown Step 4 adds the matching authoring rule.)
<!-- END ADDED PROBES #176 -->
<!-- BEGIN ADDED PROBE #221 — prose-only prohibition with no structural backing -->
- **Prose-only prohibition, no structural backing (#221)**: for every explicit **"do NOT …"** statement
  in a task's action prompt ("do NOT wrap this in a retry loop," "do NOT weaken this assertion to
  tolerate fewer than N arrivals," "do NOT use approach X"), verify a guardrail exists that would catch
  the forbidden shortcut. A prohibition backed by nothing but prose is free for an adversarial — or
  merely lazy — implementer to ignore; this probe mirrors exactly how the pattern was found (a real
  dogfood, not a synthesized example): a flaky-concurrency-test hardening plan forbade weakening
  `Assert.Equal(3, …)` to `Assert.True(… >= 2)` and forbade a retry-until-pass wrapper, and neither
  prohibition had a backing guardrail — both are the cheapest wrong implementation for their task.
  **Check the forbidden behavior against structural checkability** (a regex/count/shape test on the file
  the task modifies) before flagging: if it IS checkable and no guardrail enforces it, that's the
  finding; if it genuinely is NOT checkable (a judgment call with no mechanical proxy), confirm the
  breakdown report says so explicitly rather than treating the gap as covered. **Escalate to BLOCKER when
  the task's OTHER guardrail is empirical/statistical** (a "run N times, assert it always passes" flake
  check) — the forbidden shortcut can make THAT guardrail easier to pass, not harder (a weakened
  assertion tolerates the very race the empirical check exists to catch), so the guardrail suite as a
  whole rewards the shortcut instead of merely missing it. WEAK when the guardrail suite is otherwise
  deterministic and simply silent on the prohibition. Fix: add the missing structural guardrail (a
  negative assertion, #176, for an excluded keyword/scenario; a regex-lock on load-bearing text
  surviving verbatim, or a call-count + forbidden-construct scan for a banned approach/shape) — or, if
  genuinely not checkable, require the breakdown report to name it as an accepted, unguarded judgment
  call. (Catalogue → "Prose-only prohibition, no structural backing"; plan-breakdown Step 6 adds the

<!-- BEGIN ADDED PROBE #203/#204 — stale line-number pointer / unhedged sibling-architecture claim -->
- **Stale line-number pointer / unhedged architecture claim about a not-yet-run sibling (#203/#204)**:
  for every task whose action prompt references code belonging to **another task in the same plan**,
  check the DAG wave placement first — is the referenced task in an **earlier wave** than this one (it
  will run and commit its own edits before this task's attempt starts)? If so, scan this task's prompt
  for two violations:
  1. **A line number pointing into a file the earlier-wave task will modify** (`~231-253`, "around line
     N", "lines X-Y") — by construction the earlier task's edits land before this task runs, so the
     pointer is stale on arrival, not merely at risk of going stale. Flag **WEAK**, **BLOCKER** when the
     cited file is exactly the earlier task's own `writeScope` (the collision is certain, not merely
     plausible) — name the file and the earlier task.
  2. **An unhedged "here's how it currently works" claim about the earlier task's implementation**
     ("this REPLACES/extends the same `<X>` path", "task N built `<Y>` this way") stated as settled fact
     rather than a caveated hypothesis. Flag **WEAK**; **BLOCKER** when the plan gives no other reason to
     believe the claim holds (nothing else in the plan constrains HOW the earlier task must implement its
     deliverable, so the claim is a guess dressed as fact).
  This is the exact plan-0009-lineage failure (issue #202): a later-wave task's prompt cited
  `Scheduler.cs ~231-253` and asserted a sibling task "extends the same Scheduler path" — the sibling
  actually built a standalone `PlanPreflightPhase.cs`, and the line numbers had shifted by the time the
  later task ran, costing 60-170+ turns of pure re-discovery (one attempt fully exhausted its turn
  budget touching zero of its own deliverables). Fix: replace the line number with a durable,
  structure-stable marker (a distinctive comment string, a method/class/type name, a grep-able symbol),
  and rephrase the architecture claim as a checkable hypothesis — "this reflects the plan-authoring-time
  state, before task N had actually run — verify it's still accurate before assuming the same shape
  applies here" (catalogue → stale line-number pointer / unhedged architecture claim; SKILL.md Step 6).
  **Cross-check `maxTurns`**: a task that trips this probe usually also needs the `maxTurns: 75` bump for
  the fourth turn-expensive archetype (SKILL.md Step 4a / catalogue "maxTurns budgeting (#94)") — if the
  prompt text is hedged/de-staled but the task is still left at the default budget (or vice versa), flag
  it as a **half-applied fix**: the two are companions for the same re-discovery risk, not independent
  bullets, so fixing only one leaves the other half of the risk unaddressed.

<!-- BEGIN ADDED PROBE #193 — orphaned pre-existing golden swept in by a broad tests-pass filter -->
- **Orphaned golden swept in by a broad `tests-pass` `--filter` (#193)**: the **runtime** analogue of
  the #176 transitive-compilation probe. There the trap is compile-time (a test compiles a type a
  non-ancestor produces); here it is a **runtime assertion** — a code-change task's `tests-pass`
  guardrail uses a broad **name-substring** `--filter` (`--filter "FullyQualifiedName~Renderer"`,
  `~Serializer`, `~Golden`, `~Snapshot`, a bare namespace substring) that, beyond the task's own
  new tests, **also matches PRE-EXISTING tests** the task did not author. For **each** code-change
  task whose `tests-pass` guardrail carries such a broad `--filter`, enumerate the pre-existing tests
  the substring matches that are **NOT** authored by an ancestor test-author task (grep the repo's
  existing test tree for the filter substring; the matches that already exist at plan start are the
  orphans). For each orphan, ask: *does this task's change plausibly alter a **pinned literal /
  golden file / snapshot / approved output** that orphan test asserts against?* (a task that touches a
  renderer, a hash/serializer, a formatter, a message schema, any cross-cutting OUTPUT shape is the
  high-risk case — it shifts bytes every golden downstream of it pins). If **yes** AND that test +
  its golden fixture are **outside the task's `writeScope`** AND **no other task owns** re-baselining
  them → **BLOCKER**: the task is required to make a pre-existing test pass whose pinned golden its
  own change invalidates, and it **cannot edit** the golden (write-scope check red-halts the fix) —
  every attempt fails on an orphan it can't own and dead-ends at `needsHuman`. This is the runtime
  sibling of #176's "can't fix a compile error outside its writeScope" trap (there the agent
  redefines the type and collides; here it simply cannot converge). Fix, in order of preference:
  (a) **narrow the `--filter`** to the task's own tests (a class-name / trait filter, not a broad
  substring) so the orphan is never swept in; or (b) **widen the task's `writeScope`** to OWN the
  golden fixture + its pinned test, so the re-baseline is in-scope; or (c) add a **dedicated
  re-baseline task** (ancestor of this one) that owns and regenerates the affected golden, with this
  task depending on it. Severity: **BLOCKER** when the change certainly shifts the pinned output;
  **WEAK** when the collision is plausible but not certain (the filter is broad and an orphan pins a
  literal the change *might* touch). (Catalogue → orphaned-golden / broad-filter trap; relates to
  #176 transitive-compilation and the write-scope test-protection gate. plan-breakdown Step 4 adds

  pattern-matches/regexes against a **specific tool's printed console output** — a
  `Select-String`/regex check on `dotnet test`'s summary line, a grep on a build tool's error
  format, anything parsing text a tool PRINTS rather than just checking its exit code or a file
  it wrote — carries an unstated assumption about that tool's exact output format. Reading the
  script and judging whether the regex "looks plausible" is a different question from "does it
  actually match what the tool prints," and a purely textual review cannot tell them apart. For
  every such guardrail, **run the underlying tool once** against the existing repo/workspace (it
  already has a buildable/runnable state — this costs one invocation of the real tool, not a
  purpose-built repro of the guardrail's specific scenario) and check the pattern against the
  real output. Tell: a `Select-String` / regex / grep on a tool's stdout whose pattern encodes
  field order or exact wording the review has not confirmed against a real run. The motivating
  case (#248): a `tests-fail-on-stubs` guardrail's
  `Select-String -Pattern "Passed:\s*\d+,\s*Failed:\s*[1-9]"`, stacked on top of an
  already-sufficient exit-code check, assumed xUnit's summary line reads "Passed: N, Failed: M"
  — it's always "Failed: N, Passed: M" — so the regex could never match and the guardrail failed
  UNCONDITIONALLY regardless of what the agent did. The same bug existed identically in four
  scripts in one plan; a purely textual read of all four missed it because the regex reads as
  plausible without a real `dotnet test` run to check it against. Scope this narrowly — do
  **not** run the tool for guardrails with no output-format assumption to verify (`Test-Path`, a
  `git diff`, a bare exit-code check): there is nothing there a tool invocation would confirm.
  Fix: run the tool, observe its real output, and confirm the pattern matches; once confirmed
  either way, the usual fix is to DROP the pattern-match entirely and rely on the exit code alone
  (the catalogue's stub-based-TDD form already does this correctly, `stacks/dotnet.md §4.1` —
  this is a review-side gap, not a doctrine gap). **BLOCKER** when the pattern can be shown to
  never match the real output (the guardrail fails unconditionally, dead-ending every attempt at
  `needsHuman`); **WEAK** when it matches today but rests on a fragile, unconfirmed format
  assumption (SDK/framework version, locale, verbosity level) that could silently break later.

<!-- BEGIN ADDED PROBE #302 — script guardrail not smoke-tested against valid + invalid samples -->
- **Script guardrail not smoke-tested against a valid + invalid sample (#302)**: EXTENDS #248 but is
  **DISTINCT**. #248 runs the *underlying tool* once to confirm a guardrail's assumption about that
  tool's PRINTED output; #302 EXECUTES the guardrail **script itself** (`.sh`/`.ps1`/`.py`, in any of
  the four folders) against hand-synthesized samples to prove the SCRIPT's OWN correctness — does it
  run at all, PASS a valid artifact, and REJECT an invalid one. The motivating bug had **no**
  tool-output assumption: a LikeC4 single-quote nested inside a bash `-e '...'` block was silently
  quote-stripped, corrupting the throwaway fixture on EVERY attempt regardless of the task's output —
  so #248's "run the tool once" probe did not cover it, and a purely textual read of the script missed
  it (the quote-stripping is *syntactically valid* bash; only EXECUTION reveals the corruption). For
  every script guardrail that is **runnable-at-author-time** — idempotent (no persistent workspace side
  effects; a temp dir cleaned via `trap`/`finally` is fine) AND its input is in-repo or
  **hand-synthesizable** AND it needs no live external dependency (no server boot, no network, not the
  full merged HEAD) — do the two-sided execution: `bash -n`/`sh -n` (or a `pwsh -NoProfile` parse) as a
  cheap FIRST pass, then run it against **(a) a hand-written representative VALID sample** of the checked
  artifact (expect exit 0) and **(b) a deliberately INVALID one** (expect non-zero). The
  **highest-value target** is a guardrail that RENDERS or EXECUTES the task's own **not-yet-authored
  output** (a throwaway workspace, a rendered fixture, an `--input-type` block): its real input does not
  exist until the task runs, so its first real execution is deferred to runtime today, and that is
  exactly where its own harness/fixture bugs (bash quoting, path handling, `--json` parsing) hide —
  hand-synthesize the sample and run it. Severity: **BLOCKER** when the script FAILS the valid sample (a
  false-red no correct implementation can satisfy → every attempt dead-ends at `needsHuman`, blocking
  downstream) or PASSES the invalid sample (a toothless / tautological check); **WEAK** when it is
  runnable-at-author-time but simply was not smoke-tested (a latent script bug the review should close
  now). **Not runnable-at-author-time** (needs a live service / the built binary / the full merged HEAD)
  → do NOT block: run the syntax pass, reason about correctness, and note in the report that the
  guardrail could not be author-time-executed and why (an honest deferral). Scope narrowly — a
  `Test-Path` / bare exit-code / `git diff` guardrail with no rendering, parsing, or fixture step has
  little a run would reveal that a read does not; spend the execution budget on the render/execute-the-
  output scripts. (Doctrine: `guardrails-domain-knowledge` → author-time smoke-test gate; plan-breakdown
  Step 7.0d adds the matching authoring rule.)
<!-- END ADDED PROBE #302 -->
<!-- BEGIN ADDED PROBES #254 — waved plans (nested layout) -->
- **Cross-wave `dependsOn` edge (#254)**: in a waved plan, `dependsOn` is **intra-wave only** — a task
  edge naming a task in **another wave** is a hard error (**GR2034**, `validate` catches it). Beyond the
  lint, flag the **shape** it signals: a wave-2 task that "depends on" a wave-1 artifact should express
  that dependency as the **wave-2 ENTRY gate** ("the prior wave's outputs materialized") plus the action
  reading the real path — the wave barrier already orders the stages. A cross-wave edge (or an attempt to
  fake cross-wave ordering with a duplicated task) is a **BLOCKER**: name the offending edge and the
  entry-gate rewrite.
- **Wave-qualified state key (#254 / #164 one level up)**: for every state-writing prompt action in a
  waved plan, the single top-level fragment key must be the **wave-qualified id `<waveDir>/<taskFolder>`**
  (e.g. `wave-02-provision/01-author-tests`), NOT the bare folder name and NOT the `stableId`. A bare or
  wrong-wave key is rejected as foreign on **every** attempt (the #164 loop, one level up) →
  `needsHuman`. Cross-check the harness-contract header example, the `## Task` fragment example, and the
  state-output guardrail's index (`$fragment.'wave-02-provision/01-author-tests'.<key>`) — all three must
  use the same wave-qualified id. A mismatch is a **BLOCKER**.
- **Missing / wrong-polarity wave ENTRY gate (#254 / #181 at the wave boundary)**: for each wave ≥ 2,
  confirm `<plan>/<wave>/preflights/` carries a **POSITIVE** "the prior wave's outputs materialized"
  check — the artifacts this wave builds on (real files/symbols/binary the prior wave produced) are
  present and non-empty before this wave's DAG runs (the #181 positive-baseline archetype at the wave
  boundary). It must be **positive-monotone-safe** (assert-**present**, never "not yet present" — a
  negative "absent" check at a wave-2 entry gate flips false the instant an unrelated file lands, a
  false-RED). A downstream wave whose tasks plainly build on upstream artifacts but whose entry gate is
  missing → **WEAK** (the run wastes a turn building against possibly-absent bytes, or misattributes an
  upstream-materialization failure to this wave's tasks); a **negative-polarity** wave-2+ entry gate →
  **BLOCKER** (it will false-RED). (Wave 1's entry gate is the ordinary plan-start baseline — a
  brownfield green-start or a negative fresh-start — reviewed by the §2 baseline probe.)
- **Wave EXIT gate — GR2028 per wave + intermediate-wave union-safety (#254 / #125 / #165)**: the
  four-folder gap and union-safe probes (§2) apply to **each wave's** `<plan>/<wave>/guardrails/`:
  - A **multi-leaf / fan-in** wave whose exit gate is absent, empty, or tautological (`exit 0`) → same
    **BLOCKER** as the flat terminal-folder probe, but **per wave** (GR2028 applies per wave): the exit
    gate needs ≥1 real integration re-run (build/suite or a union invariant).
  - An **INTERMEDIATE** wave's exit gate that marks a **whole-build / whole-suite** check
    `scope:"integration"` is the **#125 terminal-postcondition anti-pattern** → **BLOCKER**: the
    integration set re-runs at every union, and a whole build/suite red-halts a correct partial merge.
    A whole-build/suite check must be **LOCAL** (no `scope`); the wave's `scope:"integration"` guardrail
    must be a union-safe CONDITIONAL invariant. Only the **LAST** wave's exit gate (which runs on the
    fully-merged HEAD) is the right home for a whole-suite LOCAL `tests-pass` — the whole-plan terminal
    boundary. Flag a plan-root `<plan>/guardrails/` that merely DUPLICATES the last wave's exit gate as a
    NIT (it is optional-additive, not a second terminal gate).
- **Later-wave prompt references earlier-wave code (#254 / #203)**: apply the "#203/#204 stale
  line-number / unhedged architecture claim" probe with **wave placement** as the earlier/later
  discriminator — a wave-2 prompt describing wave-1's not-yet-run output is the canonical case. The
  stronger fix here is the **JIT staged-breakdown flow** (author the later wave against the materialized
  integration worktree, so nothing is guessed); if the plan authored a downstream wave up front with
  guessed paths/line-numbers where JIT was available, flag it **WEAK** and recommend the JIT flow +
  durable markers + the `maxTurns: 75` companion bump.
- **JIT stub wave (#254)**: a declared-but-empty `wave-NN-<slug>/` with an empty `tasks/` is **not** a
  finding — it is the intended JIT staging (the run will honest-halt there, author the wave against the
  materialized workspace, review it, resume). Do NOT flag an empty downstream wave as "missing tasks";
  confirm the breakdown report documents the JIT workflow for it. (Only an **authored** wave gets the
  full adversarial pass; a stub is reviewed when it is later filled.)
<!-- END ADDED PROBES #254 -->

### 3. DAG soundness
- Every edge justified (artifact, guardrail, or explicit ordering — not prose order).
- **Missing edges**: task B reads a state key or file only task A produces, with no
  path A→B. **Apply this at the IMPLICIT COMPILATION level too** (#176): if B's verification
  compiles a test project containing an ancestor test-author task's `.cs` file that references a
  type produced by a non-ancestor implementation task, that is a missing edge — see the
  "Transitive compilation dependency" probe in §2.
- **False edges** serializing genuinely parallel work.
- A terminal task aggregates (suite green / e2e) so the run has a meaningful end.
- **Terminal `<plan>/guardrails/` folder on a parallel plan (NOT an `integrationGate` sink).** A plan
  with ≥2 leaf tasks or any fan-in (the shape a parallel run produces) MUST carry a non-empty plan-root
  **`<plan>/guardrails/`** folder (the terminal gate run once on the merged plan-branch HEAD, SSOT §3.3)
  with ≥1 real integration-set re-run — see the four-folder gap probe in §2 for the content bar
  (GR2028). The retired `integrationGate: true` sink TASK is a **GR2029 hard error**: a lingering one is
  the BLOCKER, not its absence. A single linear chain with no fan-in needs no terminal folder.
- **Waved plan — the DAG is PER WAVE (#254).** In a waved plan each wave's `tasks/` is a self-contained
  DAG; check acyclicity, missing edges, and false edges **within each wave**. Cross-wave ordering is the
  barrier, not a task edge (a cross-wave `dependsOn` is GR2034 — see the §2 waved probe). "A terminal
  task aggregates" becomes **per wave**: each multi-leaf/fan-in wave's EXIT gate is its aggregation
  point, and the LAST wave's exit gate is the whole-plan end.

### 4. Missing-insertion check
Re-apply plan-breakdown Step 5: any guardrail referencing an artifact no ancestor
produces and the repo doesn't already contain → a missing guardrail-enabling task.

### 5. State-contract lint
- Every prompt action carries the harness-contract header block.
- Every state key consumed downstream is produced upstream (or seeded).
- **Every state key consumed downstream has a fragment-key-present guardrail on its
  producer** (reads `GUARDRAILS_STATE_FRAGMENT`, asserts non-null/non-empty) — otherwise
  the action can skip writing the key and the consumer runs with null. (Catalogue
  state-output leaf.)
- **State-out key MUST be the task FOLDER NAME, never the `stableId` (#164).** For every
  state-writing prompt, read the fragment example/instruction in the `## Task` body and the
  harness-contract header. The single top-level key must be **this task's folder name** (the
  directory the `task.json` lives in). A fragment example keyed by anything else — most often
  the task's `stableId` (a `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]*$` token like `j9hf6y` that is NOT the folder
  name), a foreign task's folder name, or an arbitrary shared key — is a **BLOCKER**: the
  harness rejects it as a foreign/unowned key on **every** attempt (single-writer-per-key, SSOT
  §6.2), rolling back file writes and dead-ending the task at `needsHuman` (the #164 failure
  loop). Cross-check that the producer's state-output guardrail indexes the **same** folder name
  (`$fragment.'<folder-name>'.<key>`); a mismatch between the prompt's key and the guardrail's
  index is the same BLOCKER. Fix: rewrite the fragment example to
  `{ "<this-task-folder-name>": { … } }` and align the guardrail's index.
- `promptRunners` present iff prompts exist; `allowedTools` scoped, not blanket. **On a
  multi-task plan (≥2 tasks joined by `dependsOn`), flag an `allowedTools` that carries
  stack-specific commands but no read-only git inspection** (`Bash(git log*)`, `Bash(git
  diff*)`, `Bash(git show*)`, `Bash(git status*)`) **— a MINOR finding, not a blocker**
  (plan-breakdown Step 6, #252): without it a downstream task's prompt cannot cheaply
  inspect what an ancestor task already committed and falls back to broad `Grep`/`Glob`
  sweeps. Do not suggest adding any state-mutating git command (`restore`, `reset`,
  `checkout`, `push`, `commit`, `stash`) — those stay outside `allowedTools` by design.

### 6. Report

| Task | Guardrail | Severity | What wrong implementation slips through | Concrete fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Severities: **BLOCKER** (a wrong implementation passes) · **WEAK** (gameable,
nondeterministic-where-deterministic-possible, or unactionable) · **NIT**.
For WEAK prompt-judges, the fix column contains the replacement deterministic
guardrail — ideally as ready-to-paste script text.

Then ask: **"Apply fixes?"** — per-finding approval, never bulk-silent. If a finding
concerns a guardrail the human added or edited (check `git log`/`git diff` if the
folder is tracked, else say you cannot tell), name that explicitly before proposing
changes to it.

### 7. Record the review

When the review pass is complete (findings reported; fixes applied or explicitly declined), record it
so the harness's review nudge clears:

```bash
guardrails mark-reviewed <folder>
```

**Waved plan (#254):** each wave is a mini-plan with its **own** `PlanDefinitionHash`-keyed review
marker. When you reviewed the whole plan wave-by-wave, run `guardrails mark-reviewed <folder>`; when you
reviewed a **single freshly-authored wave** (the JIT flow), run `guardrails mark-reviewed
<folder>/wave-NN-<slug>` for that wave — it records the marker keyed on that wave's hash, so re-authoring
or resuming other waves does not falsely mark this one reviewed (and editing this wave's files re-stales
just its marker). Do not mark a wave reviewed while a BLOCKER in it is open.

This writes the committed, `PlanDefinitionHash`-keyed `state/guardrails-review.json` marker (SSOT §13 /
§7.3) — the skill can't compute the `PlanDefinitionHash` itself, so it delegates to the CLI. Until the
plan's behavioral definition changes, `guardrails validate`/`run` stop emitting the GR2025 "not reviewed"
warning; editing any `task.json` / `guardrails.json`, **an `action.*` body, or a guardrail/preflight body
or `.json` sidecar** re-stales the marker and the nudge returns. `PlanDefinitionHash` **covers
guardrail/preflight/action BODIES** — not just structure/config like the narrower `PlanHash` — so editing
a guardrail's LOGIC after review (broadening a grep, dropping an assertion, `exit 0`-ing a check) NOW
re-stales the marker and re-fires GR2025 (#260); bodies are exactly what the review scrutinizes most, so
the attestation covers them. The marker is COMMITTED as part of the reviewed plan: because it is
`PlanDefinitionHash`-keyed it is an attestation about the committed plan content that self-invalidates the
instant any reviewed file — `task.json`, `guardrails.json`, an `action.*`, or any guardrail/preflight body
or sidecar — changes the `PlanDefinitionHash` (the GR2025 nudge returns), so committing it can never
falsely vouch for changed content. `--fresh` does NOT wipe it — `--fresh` clears only genuine runtime
state (`run.json`, `state.json`, `merge-conflicts.log`, `logs/`, `captured/`). Do NOT mark a plan reviewed
while a BLOCKER finding remains unaddressed — the marker vouches that the plan was genuinely reviewed.

## Quality bar
- [ ] `guardrails validate` ran first; findings don't duplicate the tool.
- [ ] `guardrails graph --check` ran; exit 2 (stale/missing) → regenerated and noted; exit 1 (error) → surfaced, not silently regenerated.
- [ ] Every BLOCKER names the concrete wrong implementation, not a vibe.
- [ ] Terminal/e2e tasks claiming an output quantity assert a STRICTLY POSITIVE value (no hollow `Assert.Equal(0,…)` / `NotNull` / bare `exit 0`); every structural property check is accessor-order-insensitive (no `\{\s*get` / `\{\s*set` anchor).
- [ ] Every WEAK judge finding names its deterministic replacement (or proves none exists).
- [ ] Coverage gaps cite the exact unverified completion criterion.
- [ ] Every `covers-key-behaviors` guardrail's required tokens are each named (directly or via synonym) in the SAME task's action prompt; a token the guardrail requires but the prompt never mentions is a BLOCKER ("the task will fail every attempt") — the human-judgement complement to the deterministic GR2026 warning (#157).
- [ ] Every TDD implementation task's `writeScope` EXCLUDES its test-author task's test files (but may TARGET the stub file the test-author wrote, #155); no task carries a vacuous `**`/over-broad `writeScope` (omission preferred over theater); confidently-scopable tasks declare a `writeScope`.
- [ ] Every inserted test-author task carries the correct TDD "red" for its type (#155): a BEHAVIORAL type has `build-passes` + `tests-fail-on-stubs` (with minimal stubs in its `writeScope`), not a lone non-zero-exit red gameable by non-compiling garbage; a split data-model task has a structural `[Fact]`/`[Theory]` covers-key-behaviors check.
- [ ] Every test-author task's `action.prompt.md` carries a **Scope boundary (harness-enforced)** paragraph (allowed path(s) + `git diff` check + retry consequence + the `needsHuman` redirect for an upstream missing-symbol compile error); absence is WEAK (#154).
- [ ] Every PROMPT task whose primary deliverable is a file under `.claude/` (new or existing) carries the verbatim STRAIGHT-TO-HATCH `needsHarnessWrite` escape-hatch instruction in its `action.prompt.md` (emit `needsHarnessWrite` to the state-out path FIRST, no direct `Write`/`Edit` probe to the `.claude/` path); absence is a BLOCKER — the tool-permission layer refuses `.claude/` writes unconditionally, so the task hits the wall on attempt 1 and dead-ends at `needs-human` (SSOT §9.3 / #191 / #313 / #321). Exempt: SCRIPT actions, and tasks that declare `stagingOutputs` for the deliverable. A task whose deliverable IS `.claude/settings.json` / `.claude/settings.local.json` cannot use the hatch (the harness rejects permission-file writes on an agent's behalf, #321) — flag it for a human author instead.
- [ ] Every state-writing prompt's fragment example/key is the task's FOLDER NAME (never the `stableId` or a foreign/shared key), and the producer's state-output guardrail indexes that same folder name — a `stableId`-shaped or otherwise-unowned key is a BLOCKER (harness rejects it every attempt → `needsHuman` loop, #164).
- [ ] A **brownfield** plan (modifies project(s) with existing tests in the touched area, worth-it gate passing) carries the #181 positive baseline as a **`<plan>/preflights/` POSITIVE check** (the general positive-baseline archetype — e.g. `01-baseline-<area>-tests-green`), NOT a no-op ROOT task: a plan-level Full Flight Check evaluated ONCE before the DAG against the starting repo, running the EXISTING area tests **via `--filter`** and asserting they pass (area-scoped, deduped one-per-area, #179-re-emit form); it targets the PRE-EXISTING tests via `--filter`, NOT the about-to-be-authored red tests and NOT the whole suite (whole-suite scope hits the #165/#176 compile-coupling trap → BLOCKER); it is DISTINCT from the terminal `<plan>/guardrails/` gate (green START before the DAG vs green END on the merged HEAD). A **greenfield** plan (or one failing the worth-it gate) has NO baseline preflight (a vacuous `dotnet test` over a zero-test project is itself a finding). Missing baseline preflight on brownfield is WEAK (BLOCKER when the area's existing tests are in fact red at start). A RED baseline preflight halts the run before the DAG (the general Full-Flight-Check semantics) (#181).
- [ ] A parallel plan (≥2 leaf tasks or any fan-in) has NO `integrationGate: true` sink task — a lingering `integrationGate: true` in any `task.json` is the BLOCKER (a **GR2029** hard error), not its absence — and instead carries a non-empty **`<plan>/guardrails/`** folder (the Terminal Gate) with **≥1 real integration-set re-run** (a whole-repo build / full suite / union invariant, `validate` enforces this as **GR2028**; a folder that merely exists or holds only a tautological `exit 0` certifies nothing → BLOCKER). Its `scope: "integration"` union-guardrail is a **union-safe CONDITIONAL invariant** (conflict-marker-free / "if X present, verify it"), NOT the full build or whole suite: a full-build or whole-suite guardrail marked `scope: "integration"` in the terminal folder is the #125 terminal-postcondition anti-pattern → **BLOCKER** (it red-halts correct intermediate unions where downstream TDD tasks have not run yet); the full build/suite must be **LOCAL** (#165). (`scope: "integration"` itself is unchanged — the per-union re-verify tag, SSOT §4.3.)
- [ ] Every `IFoo`/`FooImpl` pair has a wiring task + a composition-root guardrail that drives the REAL assembler (no seam-injecting guardrail; whole-suite green does not stand in for wiring) (#120).
- [ ] Every dispatch task routing ≥2 enum values to ≥2 concrete types whose dispatch tests use seam-injection has a per-pairing proximity check binding `<EnumValue>` to `<ConcreteType>` (WEAK if missing; BLOCKER if the only concrete check is `tests-pass`); omitted only when the tests assert the concrete TYPE NAME (#158).
- [ ] Every forbidden-keyword scan over a source file strips comments before matching; no task both documents banned constructs in a header comment AND greps for them comment-blind (#97, #98).
- [ ] Every derived-corpus task asserts input→output coverage + per-output substance floor + index completeness (`produced ⊆ indexed`) + ingestion lower bound, named as lower bounds (no judge alone for faithfulness) (#99).
- [ ] Every `scope:"integration"` guardrail is union-safe (passes the "would this pass on a partial merge with a downstream task unsettled?" test, checked against EVERY union point plan-wide — including a merge by a completely unrelated parallel sibling, not just unions structurally upstream of the guardrail's own task in the DAG, #250); terminal postconditions live in a `local` guardrail on the sink (#125).
- [ ] Every set of ≥2 tasks with OVERLAPPING `writeScope`s on a shared file has ≥1 `scope:"integration"` guardrail asserting the shared-file UNION invariant — the union re-verify is integration-set-only (#132), so a sibling's `local`-only coverage is NOT re-run at the union; flag WEAK if missing. When the shared file is a CODE file and both siblings could ADD a type/member definition, that union guardrail also carries a **duplicate-definition count check** (`[regex]::Matches($content,'class\s+<Name>').Count -gt 1`, union-safe/conditional) — a 3-way merge keeps both copies with no conflict marker (CS0101), the #175 residual; WEAK if absent.
- [ ] Every task whose verification runs `dotnet build`/`dotnet test` was checked for a **transitive compilation dependency** (#176): an ancestor test-author task's `.cs` file referencing a type produced by a task NOT in the verifying task's ancestor set is a missing edge — add the producing task to `dependsOn` (WEAK, or BLOCKER when the compile failure is certain).
- [ ] Every code-change task whose `tests-pass` guardrail uses a **broad name-substring `--filter`** was checked for an **orphaned pre-existing golden** (#193 — the runtime analogue of #176): the filter sweeps in a PRE-EXISTING test (not authored by an ancestor) whose pinned literal/golden/snapshot the task's change plausibly alters, AND that test+golden is outside the task's `writeScope` AND no other task owns re-baselining it → **BLOCKER** (the task must pass a test it can't edit → `needsHuman` loop). Fix: narrow the `--filter` to the task's own tests, widen the `writeScope` to own the golden+test, or add a dedicated re-baseline ancestor task. WEAK when the collision is plausible but not certain.
- [ ] Every guardrail that asserts a test suite PASSES (`tests-pass`/`all-tests-pass`/`specific-tests-pass`, or a production-seam driver) re-emits the failure DETAIL (assertion/exception lines) at the END of stdout so it reaches the harness retry tail — not just the `[FAIL] <name>` summary default `dotnet test` leaves (#179); absence is WEAK (degrades retry feedback, costs attempts). The INVERSE `tests-fail-on-stubs` / `tests-fail-on-current-code` checks (non-zero exit = success) do NOT re-emit and must not be flagged.
- [ ] Every action prompt that **excludes** a scenario/keyword ("do NOT include `CommanderRest`") has a matching **negative-assertion** guardrail (`if ($content -match "<keyword>") { … exit 1 }`, fail-on-present) verifying the keyword is ABSENT (#176); absence is WEAK (BLOCKER when the excluded scenario traps a downstream compile). GR2026 correctly stays silent on the negative assertion's keyword (post-#177, §4.4) — a GR2026 warning there is the false positive, not a reason to delete the guardrail.
- [ ] Every explicit **"do NOT …"** statement in a task's action prompt has a matching structural guardrail (a negative assertion, #176, for an excluded keyword/scenario; a regex-lock on load-bearing text surviving verbatim, or a count/forbidden-construct scan for a banned approach/shape) — or the breakdown report states explicitly that the forbidden behavior is not structurally checkable. WEAK when the prohibition is merely uncovered by an otherwise-deterministic suite; **BLOCKER** when the task's OTHER guardrail is empirical/statistical (a "run N times, assert it always passes" flake check) and the forbidden shortcut would make THAT guardrail EASIER to pass rather than harder — the perverse-incentive case (#221).
- [ ] Every task whose prompt references an **earlier-wave sibling's** code was checked for a stale line-number pointer and an unhedged "here's how it currently works" claim (#203/#204): a cited line number into a file the earlier task will still modify is WEAK/BLOCKER (durable marker instead); an unhedged architecture claim about the sibling's not-yet-run implementation is WEAK/BLOCKER (caveat it as authoring-time state, verify before relying on it). Cross-check the paired `maxTurns: 75` bump (Step 4a's fourth archetype) — flag a **half-applied fix** if only one of the two companion rules was applied.
- [ ] Every `scope:"integration"` union guardrail's expected-contribution tokens are each produced by a task in the integration task's ANCESTOR set (a directed path producer → fan-in); a token whose only producer is a disconnected leaf / side branch is WEAK ("if task `<N>` is later removed, this guardrail will fail spuriously — add a DAG edge or drop the check") (#159).
- [ ] Every task ran through the over-size split-trigger; any task bundling multiple deliverables / wide blast radius / 1:1-to-a-milestone / expensive-retry is flagged WEAK with a proposed split (#111).
<!-- BEGIN ADDED CHECKS #74/#75/#76/#96 -->
- [ ] Every "task A calls `B.Method()`" guardrail anchors on BOTH the type reference and the dotted call (`\.Method\s*\(`), never a bare method-name grep (#76).
- [ ] Every "extract a library that must write through `IInterface`" task has a forbidden-direct-call scan of the library folder — comment-stripped and dot-anchored, never a bare-name grep that false-REDs on a comment (#74).
- [ ] Every test-author task whose prompt enumerates ≥3 behaviors has a covers-key-behaviors check (2–3 distinctive terms, scoped to the one test file), named as a lower bound, with the unchecked behaviors reported (#75).
- [ ] Every producer↔consumer derived-name seam has a consumer-driven integration guardrail on a both-sides-present task that drives the real lookup for EVERY item and asserts 200 + a per-item marker — union-safe, no hard-coded name copy, no sampling (#96).
<!-- END ADDED CHECKS #74/#75/#76/#96 -->
- [ ] Every guardrail that pattern-matches/regexes a tool's PRINTED console output (not just its exit code or a file it wrote) was verified by actually RUNNING that tool once against the real repo/workspace and checking the pattern against the real output — not just reasoning about whether the regex looks plausible; a pattern shown to never match the real output is a BLOCKER (the guardrail fails unconditionally, dead-ending every attempt at `needsHuman`), a fragile-but-currently-matching format assumption is WEAK. Does not apply to exit-code-only / file-existence / diff checks — there is no output-format assumption to verify there (#248).
- [ ] Every `.sh`/`.ps1`/`.py` guardrail that is runnable-at-author-time (idempotent, input in-repo or hand-synthesizable, no live dependency) was smoke-tested by EXECUTING the guardrail SCRIPT itself against a hand-written VALID sample (exit 0) AND a deliberately INVALID one (non-zero) — `bash -n`/`sh -n` treated as a cheap first pass only; the highest-value target (a guardrail that renders/executes the task's own not-yet-authored output) was run against a synthesized sample. FAILS the valid sample or PASSES the invalid sample = BLOCKER; runnable-but-unrun = WEAK; not-runnable-at-author-time (live service / built binary / merged HEAD) = syntax pass + honest report deferral, never a block. Distinct from #248 (which runs the underlying TOOL, not the guardrail script) (#302).
- [ ] (#254) A waved plan was reviewed WAVE-BY-WAVE (each wave a mini-plan): the §2 adversarial probes ran per task within each wave, and each wave's entry/exit gates got the four-folder treatment. No cross-wave `dependsOn` edge (GR2034 — a wave-2 dependency on a wave-1 artifact is the wave-2 ENTRY gate, not an edge; BLOCKER if present). Every waved-plan prompt's state fragment is keyed by the WAVE-QUALIFIED id `<waveDir>/<taskFolder>` (header + example + state-output guardrail index agree; a bare/wrong-wave key is a BLOCKER, the #164 loop one level up).
- [ ] (#254) Each wave ≥ 2 has a POSITIVE, positive-monotone-safe ENTRY gate ("prior wave's outputs materialized"; missing = WEAK, negative-polarity = BLOCKER). Each multi-leaf/fan-in wave's EXIT gate satisfies GR2028 (≥1 real integration re-run); every INTERMEDIATE wave's exit gate keeps whole-build/whole-suite LOCAL and any `scope:"integration"` guardrail union-safe/conditional (a whole-suite marked `scope:"integration"` in an intermediate wave = BLOCKER, #125); only the LAST wave's exit gate carries a whole-suite LOCAL `tests-pass`. A declared-but-empty JIT stub wave is NOT flagged as missing tasks; the JIT workflow for it is documented in the breakdown report.
- [ ] No fix applied without explicit approval; human-authored guardrails called out.
- [ ] The review was recorded with `guardrails mark-reviewed <folder>` once findings were addressed/declined — clearing the GR2025 nudge (#79/#131); NOT run while a BLOCKER remained open. For a waved plan, per-wave (`mark-reviewed <folder>/wave-NN-<slug>`) after a single-wave JIT review, or whole-plan after a wave-by-wave pass (#254).
