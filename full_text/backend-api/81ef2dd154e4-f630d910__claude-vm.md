description: Launch Claude Code inside an isolated Linux micro-VM on macOS with config-driven egress, mounts, VM resources, and repo isolation (clone or live). All non-secret knobs come from two-tier YAML (global + per-repo); the guest authenticates with the host's claude.ai OAuth credential extracted from the macOS Keychain at launch, plus an identity seed (userID + oauthAccount from the host's ~/.claude.json, plus synthesized onboarding/auto-update-off/version keys) so the in-guest session comes up already onboarded, logged in, and with self-update disabled.

# claude-vm

Run Claude Code inside an isolated Linux micro-VM on macOS. Every
non-secret operational knob — VM resources, the egress allowlist, extra
mounts, the proxy, and how the repo is made available to the guest —
comes from layered **YAML config** rather than environment variables.
The guest authenticates with the **host's live claude.ai OAuth
credential**, which the launcher extracts from the macOS Keychain at
launch and shares RO into the guest, plus an **identity seed** the
launcher builds from your host `~/.claude.json` — the `userID` +
`oauthAccount` selected from the host, plus synthesized
`hasCompletedOnboarding` / `autoUpdates: false` / version keys — so the
interactive in-guest session comes up already onboarded, logged in, and
with self-update disabled (issue #88). Both are secrets, neither is
written to config, and both ride the same transient shred-on-exit
mount. No token environment variable is required — just be logged in to
Claude Code on the host.

The entry point is `bin/claude-vm` (issue #51), a preflight wrapper
that ships on PATH for the Bash tool; it forwards to the launcher and
image-build scripts, which ship as payloads under
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/payload/`. This skill explains the config
surface and drives the launcher.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Be logged in to Claude Code on this host. The launcher installs the
#    host's live claude.ai OAuth credential (extracted from the macOS
#    Keychain) AND seeds the guest's identity (userID + oauthAccount from
#    your ~/.claude.json, plus synthesized onboarding/auto-update-off
#    keys) so the in-guest claude comes up already onboarded and logged
#    in. Run `claude` once and complete the claude.ai login if you have
#    not; the launcher aborts at a preflight if you are not logged in.
#    No token environment variable is required.

# 2. (Optional) drop a global config at ~/.config/claude-vm/config.yml
#    and/or a per-repo config at <repo>/.claude-vm/config.yml.
#    Run /claude-vm-config-global to write the global config from the
#    resolved defaults, and /claude-vm-config-repo (from inside a repo)
#    to write per-repo overrides (both idempotent), or see
#    payload/config.example.yml for a starting point.
#    bin/claude-vm below also offers to create the global config for you
#    if it is missing.

# 3. Launch from inside the repo you want to run a VM for. bin/claude-vm
#    derives the repo name and root, names the run, and forwards to the
#    launcher, which makes the repo available RW to the guest.
claude-vm [claude args...]
```

On exit, the launcher copies the guest's changes back to the local
source by default (clone mode). The companion skills extract work
explicitly: `/claude-vm-diff`, `/claude-vm-apply-local`,
`/claude-vm-apply-remote`.

## Config surface

Two layers, both optional:

1. **Global**: `~/.config/claude-vm/config.yml` — machine-wide defaults.
   Run `/claude-vm-config-global` to create this file from the resolved
   defaults; it is idempotent and never clobbers an existing config.
2. **Per-repo**: `<repo>/.claude-vm/config.yml` — project-specific.
   Run `/claude-vm-config-repo` from inside the repo to write this file
   with only the keys it overrides on top of the global config; it is
   idempotent and never clobbers an existing config.

### Layering semantics

- **Scalars** (`cpus`, `mem`, `guest_image`, `repo.mount`,
  `repo.copy_back`, `proxy.*`, `claude.version`, `claude.renderer`,
  `packages.update_at_boot`, `packages.add_apt_uris_to_allowlist`,
  `claude.permission_mode`, `claude.plugins.update_at_boot`,
  `claude.plugins.add_marketplace_uris_to_allowlist`,
  `github.auth`): repo overrides global; global fills gaps; a hardcoded
  default applies only when neither layer sets the key.
- **Scalar maps** (`claude.plugins.enabled`): repo overrides global
  **per key** — each plugin-ref → boolean entry follows the scalar
  repo-wins rule independently, so a repo can flip one plugin's enabled
  state without restating the global map.
- **Lists** (`egress.allow`, `mounts`, `packages.bake`,
  `packages.install_at_boot`, `packages.apt_sources`,
  `claude.permissions.allow`, `claude.permissions.ask`,
  `claude.permissions.deny`, `claude.marketplaces`,
  `claude.plugins.bake`, `claude.plugins.install_at_boot`): **merged** —
  the union of global + repo entries, de-duplicated. This includes list
  keys nested two levels deep (e.g. `claude.permissions.allow`,
  `claude.plugins.bake`), not just top-level keys.

- `egress.allow` is written to a newline-delimited file whose path is
  exported as `CLAUDE_VM_EGRESS_ALLOWLIST`. When `proxy.cmd` is unset,
  the launcher defaults to the bundled tinyproxy launcher
  (`payload/proxy/tinyproxy-launch.sh`), which reads that file and binds
  `CLAUDE_VM_PROXY_PORT`. A `proxy.cmd` override must likewise read that
  file instead of a hand-maintained allowlist baked into the command.
- `mounts` generates the extra `virtio-fs` device flags. A leading `~`
  in `source` expands to `$HOME`.
- `claude.version` selects which `claude` binary the host-side verified
  cache fetches: `stable` (default), `latest`, or a pinned version
  (`2.1.172`). The host resolves a channel to a concrete version,
  downloads that version's GPG-signed manifest, verifies the signature
  against the operator's pinned key, checksum-verifies the binary, caches
  it keyed on the version, and mounts it RO into the guest. A failed
  `gpg --verify` or a checksum mismatch **aborts the launch**. On a warm
  boot (already cached), the launcher drops `claude.ai` /
  `downloads.claude.ai` from the guest egress allowlist. See the payload
  README's "Verified claude cache" section for the operator's one-time
  key-import step.
- `claude.renderer` selects the in-guest claude's terminal renderer on
  the interactive console (the vfkit `stdio` byte pipe). Both renderers
  work over the console — this is a preference, not a workaround:
  `classic` disables the alternate-screen buffer
  (`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ALTERNATE_SCREEN=1`), `fullscreen` forces the
  flicker-free fullscreen renderer (`CLAUDE_CODE_NO_FLICKER=1`), and
  leaving it unset passes nothing so claude uses its own default. The
  launcher writes the matching `CLAUDE_CODE_*` var into `run.env`. An
  unrecognized value aborts the launch.
- `claude.remote_control` is an opt-in boolean (default `false`/unset).
  When `true`, the launcher injects `--remote-control` into the in-guest
  claude invocation (unless the CLI args already carry it) and, when
  Remote Control is in effect but no `--name` was given, appends a
  date-stamped `--name` (format like `Jul10-14:30`). When `false`/unset,
  claude runs without Remote Control and the CLI args pass through
  unchanged. Accepts `true`/`false` (or unset); any other value aborts
  the launch. This is the config-driven equivalent of passing
  `--remote-control` on the command line — see the interactive-session
  section below.

`claude.permission_mode`, `claude.permissions.*`,
`claude.plugins.bake` / `.install_at_boot` (as `enabledPlugins`), and
`claude.plugins.enabled` are **consumed** by the guest `settings.json` render
(issue #104) — the launcher renders `/root/.claude/settings.json`
host-side and shares it into the guest (see "Guest Claude settings.json"
below). `packages.bake` and `packages.apt_sources` are **consumed** by the
guest-image build (issue #105 — see "Guest image" below). The remaining
keys are schema + merge only as of issue #103 — the consumers that
install-at-boot packages, seed marketplaces/plugins, or seed a GitHub token
land in sibling slices under #39. They resolve correctly through
`payload/lib/config.sh` today; nothing downstream reads them yet.

- `packages.bake` / `packages.install_at_boot` list the apt packages to
  bake into the guest image vs. install at boot (blocking, before
  claude starts). Both union global + repo entries. `packages.bake` is
  baked at build time (issue #105): the baked packages are present in the
  guest with no boot-time network, and the image is cached per bake set
  (see "Guest image" below).
- `packages.update_at_boot` (default `true`) runs `apt-get update &&
  upgrade` at boot; `packages.apt_sources` (union) adds third-party apt
  repos as `{name, repo, key_url}` entries. `apt_sources` is baked into the
  build (issue #105): each entry's `key_url` is fetched into a keyring and the
  repo added `signed-by` that key, so its packages install at image-build time
  (e.g. `gh` from cli.github.com).
- `packages.add_apt_uris_to_allowlist` (`auto` default | `always`)
  controls whether URIs derived from configured apt sources are added
  to the proxy egress allowlist only when boot-time package work needs
  them (`auto`), or unconditionally so in-session installs also work
  (`always`). The knob never removes URIs that scheduled boot-time work
  requires.
- `claude.marketplaces` (union of `{name, url}` entries) and
  `claude.plugins.update_at_boot` (default `true`) / `.add_marketplace_uris_to_allowlist`
  (`auto` default | `always`) control which marketplaces the guest has
  available and how plugin refresh/allowlisting works at boot.
  (`claude.plugins.bake` / `.install_at_boot` are consumed by the
  settings.json render below as `enabledPlugins`; the actual plugin
  installation is still a #39 sibling slice.)
- `github.auth` (`none` default | `host-token`) selects whether the
  guest is seeded with a GitHub auth token derived from the host.

### Guest Claude settings.json (issue #104)

The launcher renders the guest's `/root/.claude/settings.json`
host-side from the merged config and shares it into the guest over the
existing transient `claudecreds` mount (the same one the OAuth
credential and identity seed ride). The guest boot launcher installs it
at `$HOME/.claude/settings.json`. The rendered file is derived from the
claude-vm configs **only** — the host's `~/.claude/settings.json` is
never read, so the guest deliberately runs its own (possibly riskier)
posture:

- `permissions.allow` / `.ask` / `.deny` come verbatim from
  `claude.permissions.*` (each a unioned list).
- `permissions.defaultMode` comes from `claude.permission_mode`
  (`bypassPermissions` default | `default`). Only those two values are
  accepted — any other aborts the launch (it is a security-posture value
  with no defined behavior for an unknown mode). YOLO-by-default: the VM is
  the isolation boundary, so `bypassPermissions` is the default with the
  deny list as backstop. The guest runs claude as **root**, which claude
  refuses in `bypassPermissions` unless `IS_SANDBOX=1`; the launcher sets
  `IS_SANDBOX=1` unconditionally in `run.env` (the guest *is* the
  sandbox).
- `enabledPlugins` maps every ref in
  `claude.plugins.bake ++ claude.plugins.install_at_boot` to `true`
  (de-duplicated), then the optional `claude.plugins.enabled` map
  overrides those defaults per key. `enabled` mirrors `settings.json`'s
  own `enabledPlugins` vocabulary (plugin ref → boolean): `false` marks a
  plugin **installed-but-disabled** (re-enabling needs no reinstall — handy
  for toggling debug plugins like `show-loaded-rules` / `show-loaded-skills`
  around a specific issue). The map is validated **once**: every value must
  be boolean and every key must name an installed ref — an unknown key is a
  typo and **aborts the launch**.

claude-vm has **no** own CLI flags: every post-repo argument is forwarded
to the guest `claude` verbatim. Plugin enable/disable state is set through
`claude.plugins.enabled` in the config files, not on the command line.

## Interactive session (the launching terminal IS the in-VM claude)

`claude-vm <repo>` opens an **interactive** Claude Code session on the
launching terminal — the terminal becomes the guest's `hvc1` console and
you drive the full REPL inside the micro-VM (detached clone + egress
proxy). This is the product goal; headless one-shot is not. Pass
`--remote-control --name <n>` straight through (`claude-vm <repo>
--remote-control --name foo`) and the same session is *also*
Remote-Control-attached for AFK observation/replies — those flags reach
the in-guest claude via the existing `CLAUDE_ARGS` plumbing; no extra
transport is involved.

Two ways to turn on Remote Control:

- **Per-launch, via CLI** — pass `--remote-control` (and optionally
  `--name <n>`) after the repo path, as above.
- **Opt-in by config** — set `claude.remote_control: true` in the global
  or per-repo config. The launcher then injects `--remote-control` for
  you (without duplicating it if you also pass it on the CLI). Either way,
  if Remote Control is in effect but you gave no `--name`, the launcher
  appends a date-stamped `--name` (format like `Jul10-14:30`) so the run
  is named — matching the date-stamp default this skill documents. A
  user-supplied `--name` (in either `--name <v>` or `--name=<v>` form) is
  never overridden. Arbitrary CLI args survive verbatim: the launcher
  quotes `CLAUDE_ARGS` per-argument into `run.env` and the guest boot
  launcher reconstructs the exact argv, so a value like
  `--name "foo #7 micro-vm"` (with spaces and a `#`) round-trips intact.

Topology: vfkit attaches **two** virtio-serial consoles. The first
(`logFilePath`, guest `hvc0`) captures all kernel/systemd boot output to
`$RUN/guest-console.log` (preserving the observability from the
guest-console capture); the second (`stdio`, guest `hvc1`) bridges the
launching terminal. The guest runs claude as the login program of an
autologin `serial-getty@hvc1`, so claude *is* the session with no shell
in between. Boot diagnostics stay on `hvc0` (off your terminal).

Because the `stdio` console is a byte pipe that needs a real controlling
TTY on the host, **launch `claude-vm` from a real terminal**, not from a
pipe. The console carries no live window-resize channel, so the launcher
seeds the guest tty geometry once from the host's `stty size` at launch;
there is no live resize.

## Repo mount strategy (`repo.mount`)

How the repo is made available RW to the guest:

- **`clone` (default)**: `git clone --no-hardlinks` the repo into a
  **persistent** worktree, mounted RW. The guest never touches the live
  working tree or `.git`. The worktree lives under
  `<repo>/.claude/tmp/<runid>/worktree` when launched from inside a
  repo (otherwise a `mktemp` dir under `TMPDIR`). It persists after the
  run so the companion diff/apply skills can inspect and extract
  results. `.claude/tmp/` is git-ignored.
- **`live`**: mount the live repo dir RW directly. More convenient,
  less isolated. Opt-in.

### Getting work back out (clone mode)

After the guest exits, the launcher runs **copy-back to the local
source by default** (`repo.copy_back: local`). Set
`repo.copy_back: none` to disable it and extract manually. The three
companion skills handle extraction explicitly:

- `/claude-vm-diff` — read-only: show what changed in the VM worktree
  vs. the local source.
- `/claude-vm-apply-local` — apply the VM worktree's changes to the
  local source.
- `/claude-vm-apply-remote` — push the VM worktree's changes to the
  remote.

## Guest image — built on demand, version-pinned, claude verified host-side

Claude Code updates daily, so the guest image does **not** bake in
`claude`:

- The baked image is a **stable base**: a pinned OS plus a boot launcher
  that, on boot, loads the run environment and then execs the
  **host-side GPG-verified `claude` binary** mounted RO at
  `/mnt/claudebin` against the repo at `/mnt/repo`, as an interactive
  session on the `hvc1` console (issue #88). `claude` is never
  baked in and never fetched-and-run inside the guest (no
  `curl install.sh | bash` anywhere — there is no such fallback); the
  host fetches, verifies, and caches it (see "Verified claude cache" in
  the payload README). The base only changes when the base OS pin or the
  launcher logic changes — not when claude does.
- The base is **version-pinned** in `payload/build-guest-image.sh`
  (`BASE_OS_REV` + `LAUNCHER_LOGIC_REV`; never the claude version).
- **Baked packages (issue #105).** `packages.bake` and
  `packages.apt_sources` ARE baked into the image (unlike `claude`): the
  baked packages are present in the guest with no boot-time network, and
  each `apt_sources` repo's `key_url` is fetched into a keyring so its
  packages install (`signed-by` that key) at build time. An
  `apt_sources` entry's `repo` may already carry its own apt one-line
  `[options]` block (e.g. an operator-authored `signed-by=`); the
  renderer adapts to the line's existing shape instead of unconditionally
  appending a second `[options]` block (apt allows only one, and two make
  the line unparseable) — no block gets one added, a block without
  `signed-by=` gets it merged in, and a block that already pins
  `signed-by=<path>` is left verbatim with the fetched key written to that
  path's staging equivalent. `packages.bake` entries that are null/empty
  (e.g. a stray `-` in the YAML list) are stripped during canonicalization
  rather than baked in as a literal `"None"` package name. Because the image
  is a shared cache, the launcher derives a **bake-hash** — sha256 (first 8
  hex) over the order-normalized bake config (sorted `packages.bake`,
  normalized `apt_sources`) — and folds it into the pinned version
  (`BASE_OS_REV+launcherN+bake<hash>`) and the image filename. A config with
  no baked packages hashes to a constant, keeps the legacy version, and
  shares the one global `guest.raw`; a config that bakes packages gets its
  own `guest-<hash>.raw` variant, built on first use and stored alongside.
  Adding an override builds+stores a new variant; removing it reverts to the
  shared image with no rebuild. Only bake + apt_sources feed the hash —
  changing cpus/egress/permissions never rebuilds. The `guest_image` scalar,
  when set, opts out of variant derivation and is used verbatim.
- On startup, the launcher **ensures the image exists and matches the
  pinned version**. If the resolved image is missing or version-mismatched,
  it builds the image (`payload/build-guest-image.sh --output …`, passing the
  canonical bake config through `CLAUDE_VM_BAKE_CONFIG`) rather than erroring.
  The image's pinned version is stamped at `<image>.version`.
- **No image artifact is committed to the repo**, and there is no
  publish-prebuilt-image path. Every machine builds its own.

The provisioning step that produces the bootable raw image defaults to
the bundled `payload/provisioners/podman-mkosi.sh`: mkosi run inside a
throwaway rootless podman container (Debian Trixie build container,
systemd ≥ 254 for the offline, loop-device-free `RepartOffline=yes`
path), emitting a raw EFI-bootable Debian guest with the boot launcher
wired as the autologin `serial-getty@hvc1` login program (so claude
becomes the interactive `hvc1` console session — issue #88), plus an
unlocked passwordless root (`RootPassword=hashed:`). vfkit boots it
`--bootloader efi`. `build-guest-image.sh` pins the version and emits the
boot launcher, then hands `<boot-launcher-path> <output-image-path>` to
the provisioner. The `CLAUDE_VM_IMAGE_PROVISIONER` env var overrides the
bundled default with your own script honoring the same two-argument
contract.

The launcher captures the booting guest's **boot** serial console
(`hvc0`) to `$RUN/guest-console.log` via the first vfkit `--device
virtio-serial,logFilePath=…`. The recipe `KernelCommandLine` sets
`console=hvc0`, so all kernel/systemd boot output — and the boot
launcher's diagnostic/seam lines, which it writes explicitly to
`/dev/console` — are observable from the host instead of being
discarded, while staying off the interactive `hvc1` terminal. The path
is reported on exit and retained in the run dir.

## Authentication (secrets)

The guest authenticates claude with the **host operator's live claude.ai
OAuth credential** — the full-scope login credential, not a scoped
inference token — installed at `$HOME/.claude/.credentials.json`. That
bearer token alone is **not** sufficient for the interactive TUI to treat
itself as onboarded and logged in: current Claude Code also reads
onboarding + identity state from `~/.claude.json`, which a fresh throwaway
guest lacks — so without it every launch hits the onboarding/login wall
despite the mounted credential. Two keys matter beyond identity:
`hasCompletedOnboarding` (absent → claude runs its onboarding flow) and
`autoUpdates` (unset → claude tries to self-update and fails against its
RO-mounted binary in the egress-confined guest).

So the launcher **also seeds the guest's identity + onboarding state**
(issue #88): it reads your host `~/.claude.json` and emits a seed carrying
`userID` and `oauthAccount` selected from the host, plus four synthesized
keys: `hasCompletedOnboarding: true` (skip the wall), `autoUpdates: false`
(no self-update), and `lastOnboardingVersion` / `lastReleaseNotesSeen`
stamped with the concrete resolved claude version. It **additively**
carries benign host UI keys when present — `installMethod`,
`hasSeenTasksHint`, `hasUsedStash`, `tipsHistory` (each silently omitted
when absent) — and seeds a **`projects` entry for the guest mount**
(`/mnt/repo`) with `hasTrustDialogAccepted` / `hasCompletedProjectOnboarding`
forced `true` so the guest skips the "Do you trust this folder? /mnt/repo"
dialog (if the host already has an entry for the launched repo, a **named
allowlist** of benign per-project keys — `allowedTools` and friends —
survives, rekeyed to `/mnt/repo` with those two flags forced true; the
operator's prompt `history`, `lastSessionId`, and `mcpServers` are
deliberately dropped, and unrecognized future keys default to excluded).
Nothing else from `~/.claude.json` (no other `projects{}` entries, no
telemetry, no `machineID`) is copied;
`machineID` is deliberately **not** seeded — the guest mints its own. That
object is shared into the guest under the same `claudecreds` mount, and
the guest boot launcher installs it at `$HOME/.claude.json` (mode `0600`)
before exec'ing `claude`, so the in-guest session comes up already
onboarded, logged in, folder-trusted, and with self-update disabled. The
seed is built via `lib/credential.sh`'s `claude_vm_select_claude_json_seed`
(using `python3`; unit-tested in `payload/test/credential-test.sh`) and
carries account identity, so it rides the same secret posture as the
credential: written under `umask 077` into the transient, owner-only
(`0600`), shred-on-exit `claudecreds` mount, **never** into `run.env` or the
verified-binary cache. A **preflight** aborts the run with an actionable
message if the host `~/.claude.json` is missing or lacks a usable
`userID`/`oauthAccount` (i.e. you are not logged in on the host).

The launcher also quiets claude's startup **install-health check**
(issue #88): claude probes for a working `claude` at the native installer's
`~/.local/bin/claude`, but the guest execs the RO-mounted binary from
`/mnt/claudebin`, so that path is empty and the TUI prints two `claude
command at /root/.local/bin/claude missing or broken · run claude install to
repair` warnings. The guest boot launcher symlinks `$HOME/.local/bin/claude`
→ the verified RO-mounted binary right after the claude-fetch seam validates
it; the symlink target is the running binary, so the version comparison
passes by construction and `autoUpdates: false` plus the RO mount prevent
write-through (empirically confirmed to clear the warnings on real hardware).
Belt-and-braces with the seeded `autoUpdates: false`, the launcher also
writes the documented `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1` env knob into `run.env`.

A second **credential-token preflight** guards against a degraded Keychain
entry: the `claudeAiOauth` object can be structurally complete yet carry
**empty** `accessToken` / `refreshToken` strings (with `expiresAt: 0`) —
which happens when your host claude sessions coast on the shared auth
daemon's in-memory tokens while the persisted Keychain entry has gone
stale. Booting the guest with it lands at "Not logged in · Run /login",
and an in-guest `/login` can trip OAuth reuse-detection and **revoke your
other live sessions**. So after selecting the credential, the launcher
validates both tokens are non-empty
(`claude_vm_validate_claude_credential_tokens`) and aborts fast if not,
telling you to re-login on the **host** (`claude` then `/login`, or restart
Claude Code — either repairs the Keychain entry) rather than inside the
guest.

At launch the launcher reads the credential from the macOS login
Keychain by service name alone
(`security find-generic-password -s "Claude Code-credentials" -w`).
That Keychain item is **not** only the claude.ai login — its JSON also
carries sibling keys such as `mcpOAuth` (per-MCP-server OAuth). To avoid
mounting unrelated MCP credentials into the guest, the launcher **selects
only the `claudeAiOauth` key** and writes a file in the shape `claude`
expects, `{"claudeAiOauth": { ... }}` (selection via `lib/credential.sh`,
using `python3`; unit-tested in `payload/test/credential-test.sh`). The
selected credential is written to a transient, owner-only (`0600`)
tmpfile and shared **read-only** into the guest under
`mountTag=claudecreds`. The guest boot launcher copies it into
`$HOME/.claude/.credentials.json` (mode `0600`) before exec'ing
`claude`.

The credential is a secret and is handled like one: it is **never**
written to config, to `run.env`, or to the verified-binary cache; its
host-side tmpfile is created under a tightened `umask 077` and removed
by the launcher's `cleanup()`/`trap` on every exit. The full raw
Keychain blob (before selection) lives only in a transient tmpfile
outside the guest share and is removed immediately after selection.

**Requirements:** macOS only (`security find-generic-password` is a
macOS Keychain tool; `python3`, used for credential and identity-seed
selection, ships with macOS), and you must be logged in to Claude Code
on the host first. The launcher fails fast with an actionable message if
the host `~/.claude.json` is missing or lacks a usable
`userID`/`oauthAccount`, or if the Keychain lookup returns empty or
non-zero, or the blob has no usable `claudeAiOauth` key. `egress.allow`
must include
the Anthropic API host (`api.anthropic.com`) so the in-guest `claude`
can reach it. See the payload README's "Authentication" section for the
full mechanic.

## Requirements

`yq` (mikefarah v4+), `git`, `python3` (stock on macOS; used to select
the `claudeAiOauth` key from the Keychain blob — see "Authentication"
above), `gpg` (`brew install gnupg`, for the host-side verified claude
cache — see "Verified claude cache" in the payload README), a sha256
tool (`shasum` / `sha256sum`, both stock on macOS/Linux), and — for an
actual VM boot — `vfkit`, `podman` (with a
started podman machine, for the bundled podman-mkosi provisioner that
builds the guest image), and `tinyproxy` (for the bundled default
`proxy.cmd`). On a clean host:
`brew install yq git gnupg vfkit podman tinyproxy`.

`gvproxy` is **not** a separate install and need not be on PATH: it
ships inside the podman Homebrew formula at
`<brew-prefix>/libexec/podman/gvproxy` and a stock `brew install podman`
does not symlink it onto PATH. The launcher resolves it automatically
(an explicit on-PATH `gvproxy` first, then podman's libexec), so
installing podman is enough.

Before any image build, network call, or Keychain read, the launcher
runs a **trust-path preflight** that checks the local, instant
preconditions for the verified cache and credential selection up front:
`gpg` on PATH, the `claude.signing_key_fingerprint` pinned in config,
that pinned fingerprint actually present in the gpg keyring, and
`python3` on PATH. Immediately after, a separate **identity-seed
preflight** aborts if the host `~/.claude.json` is missing or lacks a
usable `userID`/`oauthAccount` (i.e. you are not logged in on the host).
Later, once the credential is selected, a **credential-token check**
aborts if the selected `claudeAiOauth` carries empty `accessToken` /
`refreshToken` (the degraded-Keychain state described under
"Authentication"), steering you to re-login on the host.
Each failed check prints the exact remediation
command(s) (e.g. `brew install gnupg`, the
`curl … | gpg --import` + `gpg --fingerprint` pin steps). Without this
gate, a cold boot would otherwise pay for a guest-image build and three
network fetches before aborting on a condition that was knowable at
startup. These are an additive early gate; the deep checks in the
verified cache (gpg-on-PATH and unset-pin hard-abort) and credential
selection (`python3`) remain as defense-in-depth.

After the trust-path preflight, and still before any build/boot work,
the launcher runs a **dependency preflight** that checks the VM
toolchain up front (gvproxy resolvable, `vfkit`/`podman` on PATH,
podman machine running, and — only when the bundled default proxy is in
use — `tinyproxy`). It fails fast with one actionable remediation line
per missing piece rather than dying deep in the boot sequence. A custom
`proxy.cmd` owns its own dependencies, so the `tinyproxy` check is
skipped then.

The config-resolution half (layering, scalar/list resolution) is
exercisable without the virtualization stack; see
`payload/test/config-test.sh`, and the verified-cache logic (resolve /
verify / checksum / abort / warm-boot) in
`payload/test/claude-cache-test.sh`.

`payload/test/podman-mkosi-test.sh` regression-tests the recipe the
default provisioner generates (the literal `mkosi.conf` and
`build-in-container.sh`), stubbing only `podman` at the container
handoff — added after a real end-to-end build caught failures (a
backtick-command-substitution bug corrupting `mkosi.conf`, and a missing
`curl`/`ca-certificates` in the build container) that no pure-function
`config-test.sh` case could catch, since none of them render or execute
the actual generated recipe files.

The end-to-end acceptance test — default-provisioner build, vfkit boot
to the claude-fetch seam (exec'ing the host-verified claude off the
mount), egress confinement, and the host-side GPG-verified cache — is
`payload/test/host-acceptance.sh`; it is host-gated by cause: it skips
cleanly when a required binary is absent,
but a stopped or absent podman machine is not a skip — the test starts
the machine itself and tears down exactly what it changed on exit. A
bring-up the test attempted that then fails (`podman machine
init`/`start`) is a real failure, not a skip: the test exits non-zero
rather than green-exiting with nothing proven. Diagnostics (including
the machine init/start stderr) are retained under
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/claude-vm/logs/<run-id>/` so a failed
run stays diagnosable.
