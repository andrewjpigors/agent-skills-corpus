# ddalggak - Codex App workflow

Ddalggak is a thin router. Keep procedure in `references/` and wording in `templates/`.

## Subcommands

Supported subcommands are declared in the generated table below.

Cycle: `prompt` -> `tune` -> `forge` -> `spark` -> `plan` -> `start` -> `ship` -> `review` -> `retro`; other commands support.

## Hot-Path Target Architecture

Hot path: routing, permissions, guardrails, contracts, references, stop conditions, and verification.


## Routing Invariant

Parse only the first whitespace-separated word from the invocation arguments.

1. If the first word exactly matches a supported subcommand, route to that subcommand.
2. If there are no arguments, route to `start`.
3. If the first word is an issue reference (GitHub issue/PR URL, `#<number>`, a bare issue number, or `owner/repo#<number>`), route to `start` and treat the full argument string as issue context. An issue reference is an argument, not a command word.
4. If the first word is a CLI-only command (`doctor`, `setup`, or any command handled by `bin/ddalggak.js`), do not route; reply that it is a terminal CLI command to run as `ddalggak <command>` in the shell, and stop.
5. Otherwise, when the first word is neither a supported subcommand, an issue reference, nor a CLI-only command (a typo or unrecognized word), do not fall through to `start` (fail-closed). Return `NEEDS_CLARIFICATION` with the supported subcommand list from the generated table below and ask for intent.
6. Once a route is selected, later arguments must never reroute the request, even if they look like an implementation request.
7. Immediately print exactly one route line before doing work: `-> <subcommand> 실행`.
8. The routed subcommand must stay inside the code modification permissions in the table below.
9. If arguments request changes to this skill, its routing rules, its subcommand definitions, or the skill artifact itself, stop with: `메타 요청 감지 - 이 작업은 ddalggak 서브커맨드 범위 밖입니다. /ddalggak 외부 일반 메시지로 다시 요청해 주세요.`

## Code Modification Invariant

Source edits are allowed only where the generated table says `yes`; `no` commands are source-read-only and may produce only listed artifacts.

<!-- ddalggak:generated:start code-permission-table -->
| Subcommand | May modify source files | Allowed artifacts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `start` | yes | worker agents may edit only files named in their brief |
| `review` | yes | author agents may apply accepted Critical/High review fixes only |
| `status` | no | response output only |
| `plan` | no | response output only unless the user separately asks to write a plan document |
| `issue` | no | GitHub issues only |
| `clean` | no | local branch and worktree cleanup only after merge verification |
| `ship` | no | commit, push, and draft PR for existing changes only |
| `retro` | no | retrospective notes and memory update request artifacts only |
| `prompt` | no | brief artifacts after explicit confirmation |
| `tune` | no | goal-alignment brief artifacts only |
| `forge` | no | acceptance-criteria artifacts only |
| `spark` | no | runtime-goal sentence artifacts only |
| `check` | no | local review notes only; no repository edits |
| `getwiki` | no | delegate to dedicated `/getwiki` read-only retrieval |
| `setwiki` | no | delegate to dedicated `/setwiki` approval-gated write workflow |
| `ulw-loop` | yes | scoped edits; no GitHub |
| `ulw-plan` | no | plan output only |
| `ulw-research` | no | research output only |
| `gjc-plan` | no | coordinator evidence |
| `gjc-execute` | yes | approved edits; no GitHub |
| `gjc-team` | yes | approved team work; no GitHub |
<!-- ddalggak:generated:end code-permission-table -->

If a non-writing subcommand would need a source edit to continue, report the need and stop.
<!-- ddalggak:generated:start subcommand-table -->

## Codex App Primitives

Use Codex App orchestration names in briefs/state: `spawn_agent`, `send_input`, `wait_agent`, `.ddalggak/session-state.json`, and `request_user_input` when available. The state file owns lane IDs, worktrees, branches, issue/PR evidence, validation, review verdicts, and blockers.

## Global Guardrails

- **Base freshness first**: run `git fetch --prune`; know branch and ahead/behind state before validation, review, ship, or cleanup.
- **URL beats cwd**: parse GitHub owner/repo/number from issue, PR, or repo URL before mutation. If cwd remote does not match, stop and switch/clone the matching checkout.
- **Issue comments matter**: issue body and comments are both source-of-truth candidates; latest explicit comment wins over stale body text.
- **Manual merge only**: never merge or enable auto-merge unless explicitly asked in the current turn. Green checks plus review only mean ready for manual merge.
- **Approval-comment policy**: top-level APPROVE comments are evidence, not GitHub formal approval; report `CI/check`, `reviewDecision`, `mergeStateStatus`, branch protection, and human action separately.
- **Issue-PRs by default**: one issue PR per independent issue; only proven hard conflicts may use one PR with separate commits.
- **Runtime contract language**: `references/agent-runtime-contract.md` owns Task Scope Contract, Context Assembly Manifest, Resume Snapshot, Control-flow ownership, tool capability boundary, task scope contract, out-of-scope diff, and scope-expansion failure.
- **Quality Lens Router**: `references/quality-lens-router.md` owns Applicable gate families, Skipped gates, Required references, lightweight/limited gates, backend-only skip, and Repo/product conventions. Domain gate is a lens, not a mandate.
- **React Code Quality Harness**: when React/Next.js code quality, AI-generated React diffs, component/hook/state/fallback/rendering boundaries are in scope, route `react-code-quality-harness` and read `references/react-code-quality-harness.md`; do not copy gate conditions into the hot path.
- **Wiki Context First**: every subcommand must run `references/wiki-context-preflight.md`; cite wiki paths for wiki-derived claims or record retrieval gaps.
- **Wiki Bridge**: `getwiki` is read-only retrieval; `setwiki` is approval-gated write. ddalggak owns only the admission/approval boundary in `references/wiki-bridge.md` and delegates iCloud/QMD/wiki mechanics to the canonical wiki workflow.
- **Evidence Contract**: `references/evidence-contract.md` is mandatory before completion, readiness, approval, deploy, performance, UI, security, data, or API claims. Blocking evidence gaps block No evidence, no readiness or approval.
- **Simplicity / Deletability Gate**: `references/simplicity-deletability-gate.md` is mandatory for code-shape decisions. Start with small direct change first and ask why any proposed abstraction is necessary.
- **Core Invariants Reference**: `references/core-invariants.md` owns long-form guardrail rationale for Counterargument Pass, privacy, knowledge extraction, rendered evidence, component methodology gate, raw UTF-8, Self-created complexity is a defect, and no silent fallback.
- **Conditional gates stay conditional**: frontend design, Vercel agent skills, and regression-library references load only when applicable; React code quality references also load only when applicable, with explicit backend-only or lightweight skip reasons.

## Shared Workflow Rules

- Inspect file ownership before parallelism.
- Parallel lanes must not share write surfaces, generated artifacts, branch mutation, or unpublished dependencies.
- Issue-PR Strategy with Conflict Fallback must state Parallelization Decision and Must not touch files. Independent issues create one PR. Conflicting scopes use one PR with separate commits only when the conflict is proven.
- Integration is not completion: independent issue lanes require commit, push, PR URL/evidence, validation, and review-ready signals.
- Protected default-branch pushes, release tags, package publication, and release-triggering workflows require explicit confirmation.

## `start` - Issue-Based Implementation

Command contract: mode `source-edit`; source edits are limited to live issue-owned scope; start publishes the issue PR via the ship procedure (`references/ship.md`) and routes cross-review through the review gate; stop on stale base, missing issue body/comments, duplicate PR, or required files outside scope.

Full procedure: `references/start-workflow.md`; reusable prompt: `templates/worker-brief.md`.

Execution contract index: target repo/base freshness, issue body+comments, Quality Lens Router Output, React Code Quality Harness when applicable, Evidence Contract, Simplicity / Deletability Gate, allowed/forbidden/inspect-only/Must not touch, one issue PR by default, hard-conflict fallback only with reason, validation/PR evidence, and blocking gaps.

## `review` - Cross-Review Loop

Command contract: mode `review-fix`; source edits are allowed only for accepted Critical/High blockers; top-level review comments are allowed; stop before APPROVE when current-head CI/checks are not terminal, blockers remain, or evidence/wiki preflight has blocking gaps.

Full procedure: `references/cross-review-loop.md`; wiki authority: `references/2026-06-04-brain-v0-wiki-authority-in-ddalggak.md`; reusable prompt: `templates/review-brief.md`.

Execution contract index: live PR/diff/files/checks/issue/head SHA, Wiki Context Preflight, Quality Lens Router Output, React Code Quality Harness when applicable, Evidence Contract, Simplicity / Deletability Gate, conditional frontend/Vercel/regression gates, React code quality gates when applicable, blocker triage, finding signal gate (triage-passing findings only; filtered notes in one collapsed details section; zero-finding reviews valid), inline line-anchored finding comments in one COMMENT-event batch (suggestion blocks when a concrete fix fits, no finding-body duplication in the top-level comment), and top-level conclusion comment when formal approval is inappropriate.

## `status` - Current State Snapshot

Read `.ddalggak/session-state.json` if present, then inspect live git/GitHub state. Report phase, lane states, branches, PRs, blockers, base freshness, and next action. Do not edit files.

## `plan` - Issue-Ready Plan

Full procedure: `references/issue-ready-plan.md`; wiki preflight: `references/wiki-context-preflight.md`; wiki bridge: `references/wiki-bridge.md`; Brain v0 authority: `references/2026-06-04-brain-v0-wiki-authority-in-ddalggak.md`.

Execution contract index: source of truth, non-goals, context anchors, assumptions/unknowns, work inventory, ownership, forbidden/inspect-only files, Quality Lens Router Output, React Code Quality Harness when applicable, Evidence Contract, Counterargument Pass, Simplicity / Deletability Gate, one issue PR by default, conflict fallback only with proof, Parallelization Decision, Must not touch, evidence/validation, and commit message.

## `issue` - Plan To GitHub Issues

Convert a plan into GitHub issues without editing repository files. Preserve Owned files, Must not touch, Parallelization note, Commit lane suggestion, Validation/evidence, and Dependencies / blocked by.

Issue titles and bodies must be submitted as raw UTF-8, not JSON-escaped text. Before any `gh issue create` or `gh issue edit`, reject or decode titles/bodies containing literal Unicode escapes such as `\\uD558` / `\\ud558`; do not persist those escape sequences to GitHub. Prefer `--body-file` for Markdown bodies, and for non-ASCII titles prefer a UTF-8 REST payload written with `json.dumps(..., ensure_ascii=False)` via `gh api --input`. After creation, re-read `gh issue view --json title,body,url` and verify the live title contains Korean characters, not literal `\\uXXXX` sequences.

## `ship` - Publish Current Lane

Ship only existing changes. Confirm scope, re-read issue context, fetch, validate, locally review where feasible, stage intended files, commit with What and Why, push, open a draft PR, verify PR existence, and keep it draft until current-head checks and review evidence support ready for manual merge.

## `clean` - Post-Merge Cleanup

Verify live PR merge evidence first, fetch, inspect dirty state, then clean only safe local branches/worktrees/state artifacts. Stop on uncommitted work or contradictory live state.

## `retro` - Retrospective

After merge, summarize the cycle and extract reusable lessons without storing transient PR numbers or commit SHAs as memory. Use `references/wiki-bridge.md` for setwiki admission: default review-only, explicit approval before wiki write. Use references/retrospective-workflow.md for low-frequency details.

## `prompt` - Prompt Optimizer

Prompt Safety / Brief Compiler compact index: Prompt Audit, `prompt grill-me`, Unsafe Prompt Gate.

Judgement labels: `READY_FOR_BRIEF | NEEDS_CLARIFICATION | BLOCKED_UNSAFE | DISCOVERY_ONLY`.

Preserve `source_edit_allowed: false`; compile brief/review/fix artifacts only, and end with `PROMPT_DONE`.

## `tune` - Tune Goal Brief

Full procedure: `references/tune-goal.md`; source-grounded goal brief with scope, non-goals, assumptions, open questions, validation surfaces, and no source edits.

## `forge` - Forge Acceptance Criteria

Full procedure: `references/forge-goal.md`; objective command/observation plus expected-result acceptance criteria, with no source edits.

## `spark` - Spark Runtime Goal

Full procedure: `references/spark-goal.md`; copyable runtime goal sentence, validation checklist, non-goals, next instruction, and no source edits.

## `ulw-loop` - ULW Loop

Full procedure: `references/ulw-loop.md`; `source_edit_allowed: true`; `github_write_allowed: false`; `ULW_LOOP_DONE`.

## `ulw-plan` - ULW Plan

Full procedure: `references/ulw-plan.md`; `source_edit_allowed: false`; `ULW_PLAN_DONE`.

## `ulw-research` - ULW Research

Full procedure: `references/ulw-research.md`; `source_edit_allowed: false`; `ULW_RESEARCH_DONE`.

## `gjc-plan` / `gjc-execute` / `gjc-team` - Gajae-Code Delegation

Full procedure: `references/gajae-code.md`; `gjc_delegate_plan`; `gjc_delegate_execute`; `gjc_delegate_team`; `allow_mutation: false`; explicit user approval; external GJC visible-session helpers; `GJC_PLAN_DONE`; `GJC_EXECUTE_DONE`; `GJC_TEAM_DONE`.

## `check` - Local Diff Check

Run a read-only local diff review. Capture base freshness, status, diff stat, ignored/local-only/generated paths, and findings. Use references/local-diff-check.md for details.

## GetWiki Bridge

Full procedure: `references/wiki-bridge.md`. Delegate to dedicated `/getwiki` for read-only retrieval. Preserve source paths or retrieval gaps; do not mutate wiki files.

## SetWiki Bridge

Full procedure: `references/wiki-bridge.md`. Delegate to dedicated `/setwiki` for approval-gated write workflow. Require explicit approval before wiki mutation; do not inline iCloud/QMD mechanics.

## Review Gate Contract

Normal finish pipeline: local validation, publish evidence when requested, fresh adversarial review, triage, accepted Critical/High fixes, revalidation, and top-level review comment when formal approval is inappropriate. Return gate_result, blocking_summary, next_action, and lane_completion_state.

## Common Pitfalls

Pitfalls: stale repo, missing comments, hallucinated deps, force-push loops, test-pass completion, review in implementation worktree, local-only staging, over-fixing Medium findings, Markdown routing/fence loss, unrendered frontend approval, analytics without privacy lists.

## Verification Checklist

- Base freshness and ahead/behind state known.
- Issue body and comments inspected.
- Allowed, forbidden, inspect-only, and Must not touch files explicit.
- New dependencies avoided or proven.
- Subagent side effects rechecked with git/GitHub.
- Tests distinguished from commit, push, PR, and review completion.
- Markdown edits preserve frontmatter, routing, code permissions, headings, fences, and numbering.
- Evidence Contract, Simplicity / Deletability Gate, and relevant conditional references applied or skipped with reasons.

## Completion Signals

Per-subcommand completion signals come from each command contract's `output_contract.completion_signal` and are listed below so the installed skill payload carries them without `core/`. Multi-agent handoff signals LANE_READY, REVIEW_DONE, and FIX_DONE are defined in `templates/worker-brief.md`, `templates/review-brief.md`, and `templates/fix-brief.md`.

## Stop Conditions

Stop when source edits fall outside the routed subcommand, a lane needs files outside its allowed list, a hard blocker would force an unauthorized topology, validation mutates unexpectedly, release/publish automation lacks explicit confirmation, state contradicts live git/GitHub, base freshness cannot be established, the issue is fundamentally thin, or the target is ignored/local-only/repo-external and cannot be represented safely in PR workflow.

## Reference Contract Summary

The following compact contract keeps hot-path guardrails operational while detailed procedure moves to references/templates/scripts. Each item is a required review or routing concept, not a standalone checklist to satisfy mechanically:

- URL beats cwd
- GitHub URL handling criteria
- owner/repo/number
- cwd remote does not match
- Task Scope Contract
- Context Assembly Manifest
- Resume Snapshot
- Control-flow ownership
- Runtime contract language
- Small focused workers, explicit orchestration
- tool capability boundary
- task scope contract
- out-of-scope diff
- scope-expansion failure
- Diff Footprint / Scope Expansion Review
