description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "run daily news", "publish today's news", "draft today's vatt-ghern roundup", "do the daily-news routine", invokes `/vatt-ghern:daily-news`, or asks Claude to author tech-news posts for the vatt-ghern blog. The skill produces one daily-roundup HTML (10 items) plus up to three daily-deep-story HTML posts under `src/posts/YYYY/MM/DD/`, runs anti-duplication checks (exact source-URL/news_id against the full archive, fuzzy title similarity against the past 7 days), and opens a PR to `main`. Always use this skill (instead of authoring news posts ad-hoc) so output stays consistent with the archetype rules, design system, and dedup conventions.

# daily-news

Curate today's tech news for the vatt-ghern blog and publish it as bespoke
HTML posts. Adopt a senior-tech-lead persona, fetch from a priority source
list, score and de-duplicate (exact source URL / news_id against the full
archive, fuzzy title similarity against the past 7 days), write one roundup
and up to three deep-stories, and open a pull request for human review.

## When this skill runs

Three invocation paths converge here:

- **Daily** — `/vatt-ghern:daily-news` (defined in
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/commands/daily-news.md`). Executes the full
  9-step workflow below.
- **Weekly rollup** — `/vatt-ghern:weekly` (Monday morning). Skips
  Steps 2–6; reads past 7 days via
  `scripts/load-past-roundups.mjs --days=7`; computes week-over-week
  delta via `scripts/decisions/weekly-delta.mjs --end=YYYY-MM-DD`;
  authors one `weekly.html` using the `weekly-rollup` archetype.
- **Monthly rollup** — `/vatt-ghern:monthly` (first of month). Same
  pattern as weekly but `--days=<28..31>` and `monthly-rollup` archetype.
- **Routine fallback**: Claude Routines invoking the repo may load this
  SKILL.md directly when the slash command is unavailable. The routine
  inspects its own schedule to decide daily vs weekly vs monthly.

For weekly/monthly invocations, read the rollup archetype reference
(`references/archetypes/weekly-rollup.md` or
`references/archetypes/monthly-rollup.md`) — it spells out which
workflow steps to skip and what the output looks like.

Do not author daily news posts without this skill. Ad-hoc posts drift from
the archetype rules and break the dedup invariants that future days depend
on.

## Required reading before authoring

Read these references before producing output. They are the single source of
truth — do not re-derive their contents:

- **`references/persona.md`** — Voice (measured, curious, materially-rooted),
  five priority domains, what earns inclusion vs. what doesn't, punctuation
  rules (`：` not `:`; `——` not `—`).
- **`references/zh-tw-prose.md`** — 中文 prose 規則（AI 套話、黑話、
  翻譯腔、節奏、台灣用語）。鐵律：去 AI 味靠刪與改寫，不得捏造細節。
- **`references/sources.md`** — Tier-1 through Tier-5 source list with
  priority order. HackerNoon is the primary signal.
- **`references/archetypes.md`** — Required HTML structure for roundup and
  deep-story, sidecar JSON schema, content rules, scoring rubric.
- **`references/anti-duplication.md`** — Dedup rules: exact source-URL /
  news_id against the full archive, fuzzy title similarity against the past
  7 days, and how to handle near-duplicates.
- **`references/design-system.md`** — Color tokens, font stacks, component
  classes, read-tracking attribute conventions, SVG patterns.
- **`references/widget-isolation.md`** — CSS / ID / JS scoping contract for
  inline SVG widgets.

## Workflow — nine steps

Execute in order. Do not skip steps. If a step fails, report the failure
mode rather than silently producing partial output.

### Step 1: Load context

Run the load-context script and parse its JSON output:

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/daily-news/scripts/load-context.mjs
```

Returns: `today` (YYYY-MM-DD, UTC+8), `past_news_ids`, `past_urls`,
`past_roundup_titles`, `past_deep_titles`. Keep this blob — it is the
anti-duplication ground truth for steps 3, 4, and 5.

### Step 2: Fetch sources

Run the dispatcher to pull every registered source:

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/daily-news/scripts/fetch-all.mjs
```

It reads `src/_data/sources.yml`, calls the right fetcher per `type`
(arxiv, hf, sitemap, lobsters_json, html_index), updates
`src/_data/web-state.json` for sitemap sources, and prints a summary.

For `html_index` records the script returns them in `deferred[]` —
those still need Claude's `WebFetch` tool for LLM summarisation. Walk
each deferred record in tier order and ask:

> "List the top 8 items from this page that look like original
> engineering blog posts (not job listings, marketing pages, or product
> launches without technical content). For each, give me title, canonical
> link, and a 1-2 sentence summary of the substance."

Merge the WebFetch results with the dispatcher's `candidates[]` array,
de-duplicate by canonical URL across sources, aim for ~50–100 candidates
total. If fewer than 5 sources succeed (concrete + deferred combined),
fail-fast: report which sources failed and abort without writing files.

**Sitemap candidates need a title-resolution pass.** Records from
`sitemap` sources carry `title: <url>` because a `sitemap.xml` has no
human title. Before scoring, batch-WebFetch each sitemap candidate
URL (skip if it scores < 5 on the rubric without fetching). Replace
`title` with the page's `<title>` or `<h1>`; if WebFetch returns a
listing/index page rather than an article, drop the candidate.

The full source catalogue and per-source rationale lives in
`src/_data/sources.yml`. The narrative in `references/sources.md`
documents tier philosophy.

### Step 3: Score and filter

For each candidate, assign a domain (ai / systems / infra / web / backend)
and a subjective score 0–8 covering the rubric's three subjective axes
(`teaches non-obvious` + `actionable` + `substantial original`). The
mechanical +2 domain-coverage bonus is added by the score module below.

Drop candidates that:

- Have a canonical URL already in `past_urls` (full archive — a source
  covered once stays a duplicate forever)
- Have a title whose Jaccard char-bigram similarity > 0.85 against any
  `past_roundup_titles` (recent 7-day window; compute this manually — the
  formal check runs in step 8 via `check-dup.mjs`)
- Violate the "what does NOT earn a place" rules in `persona.md`

**Advisory check**: write the surviving candidates (each carrying
`subjective_score: 0-8`, `domain`, `url`, `title`, `source_id`,
`source_tier`) as a JSON array and pipe through the score module to add
the objective `+2 domain coverage bonus` mechanically:

```bash
cat candidates.json | node skills/daily-news/scripts/decisions/score.mjs > scored.json
```

The module adds `coverage_bonus` and `score` fields. You MAY override the
final `score` if you see a rubric mismatch (e.g., the +2 bonus pushed a
marginal item into the deep-story tier). Record overrides in PR body
under `### Advisory overrides`.

### Step 4: Pick today's items (domain coverage)

Aim: all 5 priority domains represented (ai / systems / infra / web /
backend). Hard floor: ≥4 distinct domains. Per-domain cap: ≤6 items.

**Selection algorithm**:

1. Sort all candidates by score, descending.
2. Take top items in score order until 10 selected.
3. If fewer than 4 domains represented in the selected 10:
   - For each uncovered domain, find the highest-score candidate in
     that domain
   - SWAP it in for the lowest-score selected item from an
     over-represented domain
   - Repeat until ≥4 domains met
4. If any domain has >6 items in the selected list (over the cap):
   - Drop the lowest-score items in that domain until count is 6
   - If those drops bring total below 10, swap in the highest-score
     candidates from under-represented domains until 10 or until no
     candidates remain
5. If exhaustive search shows no qualifying candidate for ≥2 domains
   (genuine sparse day), accept fewer items rather than padding with
   garbage. Log skipped domains in the PR body under "Domains skipped
   today".

Assign final `news_id` values as `YYYY-MM-DD-NN` (zero-padded) in
ranked order.

**Advisory check**: pipe scored candidates through the cover-domains
module:

```bash
cat scored.json | node skills/daily-news/scripts/decisions/cover-domains.mjs > selected.json
```

The module returns `{ selected, skipped_domains, capped_domains }` with
each selected item carrying a `rank_nn` field (`"01"`..`"10"`). Wrap with
the date prefix to produce `news_id` values (`2026-05-19-01`, etc.). You
MAY override the selection (e.g., swap a marginal pick for a higher-
impact candidate the algorithm dropped). Record overrides in PR body
under `### Advisory overrides`.

**PR body must list**:
- Domain distribution (e.g., "AI · 3 · SYSTEMS · 3 · INFRA · 2 ·
  WEB · 1 · BACKEND · 1")
- Any domain skipped (with reason: no qualifying candidates / all
  candidates failed dedup / etc.)
- Any domain that hit the cap and had candidates dropped (e.g.,
  "8 qualifying items in AI today, top 6 selected")

### Step 5.0: Cluster candidates across sources

Before deciding which candidates earn a deep-story, cluster them so the
same story spotted on multiple sources gets one combined brief rather
than competing briefs. Pipe the merged `candidates[]` (Step 2's
dispatcher + WebFetch results) through the clustering helper:

```bash
cat candidates.json | node skills/daily-news/scripts/decisions/cluster.mjs > clusters.json
# (npm run sources:cluster still works via the cluster-candidates.mjs shim)
```

Or in-process:

```js
import { clusterCandidates } from "./skills/daily-news/scripts/decisions/cluster.mjs";
const clusters = clusterCandidates(candidates);
```

Each cluster has shape:

```js
{ primary: { ... }, variants: [ { ... }, ... ] }
```

Two candidates cluster when their canonical URLs match (modulo
`utm_*`, hash, trailing slash) OR their title token-Jaccard ≥ 0.6.
Clustering is transitive (union-find). `primary` is the highest-tier
variant in the cluster (lowest `source_tier` number; ties broken by
longest summary then lowest `source_id`). Singletons (candidates that
didn't cluster with anything) still appear, with
`primary === variants[0]`.

Use these clusters as the unit of decision in the rest of Step 5: one
deep-story per cluster, not per candidate. A cluster's score = its
`primary`'s score; do not aggregate scores across variants.

When a deep-story is written from a multi-variant cluster, the
sidecar's `sources[]` array must list every variant's canonical URL,
not just the primary. That is the data-layer signature of
cross-source synthesis — the post visibly draws from multiple upstream
signals.

### Step 5: Pick deep-story candidates + choose archetype

For each **cluster** whose `primary` scored ≥8 from Step 4, decide:

**a. Worth a deep-story?**

YES if all of:
- Source has drillable depth (long-form blog, paper, RFC, design doc,
  postmortem, repo with substantial README/docs)
- Topic genuinely benefits from 600-1200 lines of treatment
- Not duplicate-similar to a past `past_deep_titles` entry (Jaccard
  bigram similarity ≤ 0.70)

**b. If yes, which archetype fits?**

Decision tree:

| Signal | Pick |
|---|---|
| Time-ordered story of an event | `narrative` |
| Structural exposition of a new design / algorithm / protocol | `technical-deep-dive` |
| "Why is this happening?" puzzle with hypotheses | `investigation` |
| Two or more options to choose between | `comparison` |
| Reader may not know what X even is, concept needs explained | `explainer` |
| None fit cleanly, or fits multiple awkwardly, or hybrid | `freeform` |

**IMPORTANT**: Archetypes are SUGGESTIONS. When in doubt — or when
forcing a structured archetype would worsen the prose — pick
`freeform`. A forced fit produces worse content than free shape.

**Advisory check**: for each ≥8 cluster, extract the 6 archetype signals
(`time_ordered`, `structural_exposition`, `puzzle_with_hypotheses`,
`multiple_options`, `concept_unknown`, `hybrid_or_unclear` — all booleans
based on what the source URL reads like) and pipe through the archetype
module:

```bash
echo '{"signals":{"time_ordered":true,"structural_exposition":false,"puzzle_with_hypotheses":false,"multiple_options":false,"concept_unknown":false,"hybrid_or_unclear":false}}' \
  | node skills/daily-news/scripts/decisions/pick-archetype.mjs
```

The module returns `{ archetype, matched_signal }`. You MAY override
(e.g., module said `narrative` but the post is structural exposition with
a timeline framing, so `technical-deep-dive` fits better). Record
overrides in PR body under `### Advisory overrides`.

**Phrasing freedom**: archetype reference files describe the *arc*
(e.g., setup → mechanism → consequence for narrative), not the exact
H2 text. Name each H2 after the actual topic — generic phrasing
(`what happened` / `why it matters` / `so what`) makes every post in
an archetype feel like the same post. The test suite checks H2
*counts*, not strings. Closer labels are also free; pick one that
fits the post's voice.

**c. Selection constraints — default is N = 3**:

The deep-story count default is **N = 3**. Aim for 3 every run unless a
named structural constraint blocks it. The constraints when writing 3:

- All 3 must score ≥ 8
- ≥ 2 distinct domains required if writing 3 (≥ 1 if writing 2)
- ≥ 2 distinct archetypes required if writing 3 (avoid "3 narratives
  in a row"); `freeform` counts as its own archetype for diversity
- If genuine candidate scarcity makes domain + archetype diversity
  unsatisfiable at N = 3, fall back to N = 2 or N = 1. Do not force a
  3rd pick that violates the diversity rule.

**Trimming N below 3 is ONLY legitimate when one of these structural
reasons applies**:

1. Fewer than 3 clusters scored ≥ 8 in Step 5.0 (record cluster
   scores in PR body)
2. Cannot find 3 clusters satisfying ≥ 2 domain + ≥ 2 archetype
   diversity (record the domain × archetype matrix in PR body)
3. Step 5d URL dedup dropped a pick AND replacement pool is exhausted
   (record refill attempt in PR body)
4. Step 7.5 blocking exhausted on a draft after 5 retries (Step 7.5c)
5. Step 8.5 blocking exhausted on a draft after 5 iterations
6. Step 7.6 fact-check: a high-load unverifiable claim unresolved
   after 3 fix rounds (Step 7.6c)

**"Budget / wallclock / dispatch cost" is NEVER a Step 5 reason to
trim.** Steps 7.5 and 8.5 have their own runtime trim mechanisms
(documented in "No skip clause exists" paragraphs). Those clauses
authorize trimming when *runtime evidence* shows the gate cannot fit
— they do NOT authorize preemptive trimming in Step 5 on imagined
cost. If you find yourself reasoning "Step 7.5 will be expensive with
3 posts so I'll do 2", STOP — that reasoning is the anti-pattern this
clause forbids.

**PR #35 (2026-05-23)** shipped 2 deep stories on a self-declared
"dispatch budget" rationalization. Step 5 had 9 qualifying ≥ 8 clusters
and domain + archetype diversity was trivially achievable for N = 3.
A third deep story (weirdgloop AI scrapers, web/narrative) was added
in the same PR after the user caught the trim in review. The PR body
now requires an explicit "Deep-story count justification" section
when N_final < 3, and `check-quality-gate-evidence.mjs` enforces it
mechanically.

**d. Pre-dispatch URL dedup (added 2026-05-21 after PR #30)**:

Before finalising the deep-story picks for Step 7a, run the URL-dedup
helper to catch any pick whose canonical URL already appears anywhere in
the archive (`past_urls` from Step 1 spans the full history, not just 7
days). This must happen *here*, not at Step 8 — otherwise a sub-agent will
write an entire deep-story (DONE) only to have it dropped during the
formal `check-dup.mjs` run, leaving an empty deep-story slot with no
refill path.

```bash
echo '{"candidates":[{"news_id":"...","url":"...","title":"...",...}, ...],
       "past_urls":[ ...from load-context.mjs... ]}' \
  | node skills/daily-news/scripts/decisions/dedup-urls.mjs
```

The module returns `{ kept, dropped }`. Any candidate in `dropped`:

1. Is NOT dispatched in Step 7b.
2. MUST be replaced by the next-best deep-story candidate from Step 5b
   that satisfies the same constraints (≥8 score, domain + archetype
   diversity). If no qualifying replacement exists, reduce N by 1 and
   note `Domains skipped today` accordingly. Do NOT leave deep-story
   N silently below target without refilling first.
3. The `roundup` separately must also drop or swap that URL — handle
   the roundup-side dedup before writing roundup HTML in Step 6.

Record any dedup-driven swap or refill in PR body under
`### Advisory overrides`. Example: "`deep[01] = GitHub eBPF` dropped on
URL collision with 2026-05-16 roundup; refilled with cluster #07 (Slack
HTTP/3, score 8, infra domain)".

**Invariant**: `N_deep_dispatched_in_step_7b == N_deep_final_in_PR`. If
not, the routine has a bug in this step. Recording a "dropped, not
refilled" deep-story in the PR body is acceptable ONLY when Step 5d
truthfully reports `replacement_pool_exhausted: true` — never as a
silent N reduction.

After picking each archetype, read the corresponding detail file for the
structure rules to follow when writing:

- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/daily-news/references/archetypes/deep-narrative.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/daily-news/references/archetypes/deep-technical-deep-dive.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/daily-news/references/archetypes/deep-investigation.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/daily-news/references/archetypes/deep-comparison.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/daily-news/references/archetypes/deep-explainer.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/daily-news/references/archetypes/deep-freeform.md`

### Step 6: Write roundup HTML + sidecar

Read the archetype skeleton at
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/src/archetypes/daily-roundup.html` for structure
reference. Author the full HTML following
`references/archetypes.md` § "Roundup spec".

Write to `src/posts/YYYY/MM/DD/roundup.html` plus matching
`.11tydata.json` sidecar.

**Required structural attributes** (the test suite checks them):

- Each item card has `id="item-NN"` (zero-padded), corresponding to
  the score-order `news_id`
- Each item card has `data-vg-readkey-item="{{page.url}}#item-NN"`
- Each item card wraps its `<h2>` + `<p class="vg-card-lede">` +
  `<p class="vg-card-meta">` content in a `<div class="vg-card-roundup-body">`
- Progress span has `data-vg-progress-of` and `data-vg-progress-total`

**Required emit order** (NOT score order):

Items render grouped by domain in this fixed order:
`ai → systems → infra → web → backend`. Within each domain, sort
by score descending. Each non-empty domain emits exactly ONE section
label header at the top of its group (with `<span class="vg-roundup-section-count">N 篇</span>`).
Empty domains emit no section.

**Lede length**: 2-3 Chinese sentences. First = what happened, second =
why an engineer cares, optional third = a concrete number / quote /
consequence. Lint allows up to 4 `。` periods (covers 2-3 sentences
plus inline references like `ClickHouse 25.11.`).

**Lede typography**: render as `<p class="vg-card-lede">` — CSS handles
the rest (Spectral 400 normal at `--fs-sm`). Do not add inline
`style=""` or italic markup.

**Hero lede chrome label**: the hero `<p class="vg-roundup-lede">` MUST
begin with an inline `<span class="vg-roundup-lede-label">TODAY'S THREAD</span>`
prefix (uppercase English, no trailing colon) followed by a space and
the CJK summary sentence. Do NOT prefix the CJK summary with
"今日主旋律：" — the English label has replaced that role.

**Do NOT hardcode read-state buttons in HTML**. The read-tracker
(`src/static/read-tracker.js`) injects all of these at page load:

- `↶ unread` button inside each `.vg-card-roundup-body`
- `✓ mark read` button (with separator) appended into each `.vg-card-meta`
- `mark all read` link appended next to the progress span

Emit only source link, optional deep link, optional tag chip in the meta
row. The button surface is owned by JS so it can evolve without
re-emitting historical roundup HTML.

### Step 7a: Prepare deep-story briefs

For each cluster picked in Step 5 (≤3 briefs total), construct a
deep-story brief following the contract in
`references/deep-story-brief.md`. Each brief is fully self-contained
— it knows its cluster, its archetype, its output path, and all the
reference files it needs.

Each brief carries these fields:

- `news_id` — the YYYY-MM-DD-NN from the roundup
- `primary_url` and `variant_urls[]` — every variant from the cluster
- `title`, `domain`, `archetype` — set in Step 5
- `summary` — 2-3 sentences telling the sub-agent what to cover
- `output_path` — `src/posts/YYYY/MM/DD/deep-<kebab-slug>.html`
- `sidecar_path` — same path with `.11tydata.json`
- `ledger_path` — same path with `.ledger.json` (the reading ledger
  the author builds while fetching sources; see
  `references/fact-check.md`)
- `related_roundup` — `/YYYY/MM/DD/roundup/`
- `recent_widgets` — a flat list of the `widget_templates` used by the last
  ~5 deep-stories, PLUS the hero each of today's *other* deep-stories is
  planning. Collect the recent part by reading the `widget_templates` field
  of the most recent `deep-*.11tydata.json` sidecars (newest first, ~5 posts);
  add today's sibling heroes so the ≤3 concurrent stories don't all pick the
  same hero. This list lets each sub-agent rotate its widget choices (brief
  step 9 + cookbook INDEX § Hero rotation). It exists to stop the site shipping
  the same hero and the same `tab-switcher` + `matter-of-fact-table` combo every
  day. If you can't cheaply gather it, pass an empty list — the sub-agent still
  applies the cookbook's rotation guidance, just without cross-post awareness.

Briefs must be finalised before any dispatch in Step 7b — the parent
agent is the only place that knows the cluster→archetype mapping and
the dedup state. Each sub-agent sees only its own brief.

The sidecar contract is unchanged:

- `archetype` is `"daily-deep-story"`
- `deep_archetype` is the value picked in Step 5
- `sources[]` MUST include every variant_url, not just the primary
  (cross-source synthesis contract from Step 5.0)

### Step 7b: Dispatch parallel deep-story sub-agents

Issue all ≤3 dispatches in ONE response (single message containing
multiple `Agent` tool blocks). Each dispatch uses
`subagent_type: general-purpose` with **`model: "sonnet"` required** —
author writing is a design-grade judgment task (archetype selection,
H2 structuring, opener/closer crafting, material density), not
mechanical pattern-matching. Default sub-agent model selection
(cheap) is wrong here. If Sonnet is not available at dispatch time,
report BLOCKED rather than fall back to a cheaper model — the routine
should produce no PR rather than a PR of unknown calibration. The
brief from Step 7a is passed as the prompt — see
`references/deep-story-brief.md` for the exact markdown template
each sub-agent receives.

Sub-agents run concurrently; the parent waits for all to return before
proceeding to Step 7c.

Each sub-agent is constrained per the brief:

- Tools allowed: WebFetch, Read, Write only.
- No nested `Agent` dispatch, no Bash, no Edit on other days' posts,
  no git operations.
- Writes ONE HTML to `output_path` + ONE sidecar to `sidecar_path`
  + ONE reading ledger to `ledger_path` (built while reading, per
  `references/fact-check.md` § The authoring discipline), reports
  back with `{status, char_count, archetype, archetype_deviations,
  note_count, spine_points}`.

If a sub-agent reports `BLOCKED` or `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`:

- `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` with a documented deviation → accept and
  proceed; note the deviation in the PR body.
- `BLOCKED` → re-dispatch that one brief with additional context, or
  drop the deep-story (reducing N to N-1). Do NOT skip QA — the
  routine remains correct with fewer deep-stories.

### Step 7c: Verify deep-story outputs

After all sub-agents return:

1. Read each output HTML + sidecar + ledger back to confirm the files exist and
   the sidecar + ledger parse as JSON.
2. Verify per-file invariants the sub-agent was told to honour:
   - Prose ≥ 4000 CJK chars in `.vg-post-body` (widget code inside
     `<script>`, `<style>`, `<svg>`, `<canvas>` excluded) — same floor
     `archetype-check.mjs` enforces mechanically in Step 8. A floor,
     not a target (tier-3 §11: density > length).
   - `<p class="vg-deep-opener">` and `<p class="vg-deep-closer"><strong>`.
   - ≥ 3 widgets total (count of elements with `class="vg-w-*"`).
   - ≥ 1 widget is interactive (contains `<script>` OR `<input>`
     OR `<canvas>` OR `animation-timeline: scroll()` in inline CSS).
   - Universal contract from `deep-freeform.md` applies to all archetypes.
   - Body matches the picked archetype's H2 *count range* (phrasing free).
   - Sidecar contains `widget_count`, `widget_questions`,
     `widget_templates` arrays; lengths agree.
   - Ledger contains a 5-7 point `spine`, non-empty `notes[]`, and a
     `perspective` set per source (`claims` may be empty — the
     Step 7.6 checker fills it).
3. **Count-conservation invariant** (added 2026-05-21 after PR #30):
   `N_deep_dispatched_in_step_7b == N_deep_written_files`. If a
   sub-agent BLOCKED or its output got dropped, refer to Step 5d's
   refill loop — do NOT silently let N drop. The PR body must
   explicitly account for every dispatched brief (DONE,
   DONE_WITH_CONCERNS, BLOCKED, or refilled-after-drop).
4. **BA-slider pane invariant** (added 2026-05-21 after PR #30): if
   any deep-story contains a before/after slider widget
   (`.vg-w-ba-*`), inspect both `.before` and `.after` panes via
   Playwright DevTools and confirm both contain visible, sensical
   content at the default 50/50 position. The PR #30 Rust BA widget
   inverted DOM order + clip-path; the right pane was authored
   correctly but never painted. Spot-check via:

   ```js
   document.querySelectorAll('.vg-w-ba-* .before, .vg-w-ba-* .after')
     .forEach(el => console.log({ cls: el.className, h: el.scrollHeight, text: el.textContent.slice(0,60) }));
   ```

   Both panes must report nonzero `scrollHeight` and non-empty
   `textContent`. See `widget-cookbook/tier-2-snippets/before-after-slider.md`
   for the canonical pattern.
5. **Banned widget templates invariant** (added 2026-05-21 after PR #30):
   the deep-story sidecar's `widget_templates` array MUST NOT include
   any of the banned ids. Current ban list:
   - `scroll-driven-explanation` (sticky figure leaves viewport
     before stages change; fragile observer margins; mobile sticky
     covers the prose)
   - `css-scroll-timeline` (same scroll-position fragility, no
     reliable fallback)

   If a sub-agent returned a deep-story whose sidecar references a
   banned id, REJECT the output and re-dispatch the brief with an
   explicit instruction to pick a non-banned alternative
   (typically `tab-switcher-pure-css` for staged narratives, or
   `annotated-diagram-walkthrough` for architecture exposition).
   The canonical reference implementation is the Meta migration
   tabs widget `vg-w-tabs-meta-ingest-migration` in
   `src/posts/2026/05/21/deep-meta-data-ingestion-migration.html`.
6. The mechanical QA gate in Step 8 (`archetype-check`, `check-dup`,
   `html-validate`, `link-check`) is the formal validation. Step 7c is
   the first-pass sanity check before that.
7. Read the sub-agent's `preflight` block. Each deep-story sub-agent
   runs a mechanical self-audit (deep-story-brief Step 11.8) and reports
   `em_dash_check`, `widget_count_match`, `placeholder_check`, and
   `cjk_char_count_ok`. If a sub-agent reports `status: DONE` while any
   preflight item is FAIL, that is contradictory — treat the story as
   BLOCKED and re-dispatch it (the per-story re-dispatch path already
   used for partial failures). The pre-flight front-loads mechanical
   contract violations that Step 8 CI would otherwise catch on a
   round-trip; it is NOT a substitute for the Step 7.5 judgment review.

PR body must list:

- One line per deep-story: news_id, archetype, slug, char count,
  archetype-deviations (if any).
- "Parallel dispatch summary": which N briefs were dispatched, how
  many returned DONE / DONE_WITH_CONCERNS / BLOCKED, and any
  re-dispatches needed.
- Explicit `N_deep_dispatched == N_deep_final` reconciliation. Any
  drop must point at a Step 5d refill attempt (success or "pool
  exhausted").

### Step 7.5: Content quality gate

After Step 7c verifies structure, run the content-quality reviewer pass on
the roundup + each deep-story. This is the only step that judges
whether the prose is actually good — Step 8 catches HTML / dedup /
archetype-count failures, Step 8.5 catches visual issues, but neither
looks at story arc, hook strength, or whether H2s are template-shaped.

**Wallclock is NOT capped** in this step. Quality trumps speed.

**No skip clause exists.** If wall-clock or Opus-budget anxiety makes
the full dual-reviewer pass feel expensive, the only legal response is
to **drop deep-stories (N → N-1) so the remaining gate fits**, never
skip the gate to ship more posts. PR #32 (2026-05-22) shipped 3 deep
stories with a self-declared "deviation: 7.5 skipped because parallel
dispatch already consumed multiple Opus batches" — this is exactly the
pattern this clause forbids. The cost arithmetic the routine performed
("8 more Opus dispatches with retry potential") is irrelevant: if you
cannot afford 8 reviewer dispatches, you cannot afford 3 deep stories
in this run. Trim to 2 or 1.

**Scope clarification (added 2026-05-23 after PR #35)**: this clause
authorizes trimming N when *runtime evidence* shows the gate cannot
fit — e.g. a reviewer crashed and won't re-dispatch, a per-post retry
loop legitimately exhausts, or an inter-post reviewer keeps failing.
It does NOT authorize **Step 5 preemptive trimming** on imagined
cost. The "if you cannot afford 8 reviewer dispatches" sentence above
is a post-hoc rule that kicks in when you have evidence the budget
won't hold; it is not an invitation to do the math in Step 5 and
trim N preemptively. If you cite "Step 7.5 will be expensive" in
Step 5b, you've inverted the clause — see Step 5c's "Trimming N
below 3 is ONLY legitimate when…" list for the legal Step 5
reasons.

Step 7c sub-agent self-checks (the author reading the archetype
reference + persona before drafting) are **not a substitute** for
Step 7.5 — author self-check is biased and shallow by construction;
the whole point of dispatching an independent Opus reviewer is to get
a judgment the author cannot give itself. Wording like "the Step 7c
sub-agent self-checks plus the Step 8 mechanical checks serve as the
quality gate for this run" is a rationalization, not a substitution
argument; reject it in your own routine output. (The deep-story Step
11.8 pre-flight is a different thing: it checks MECHANICAL contract
compliance — em-dash, widget count, placeholders, length — which is
countable, not a judgment. It is orthogonal to this clause and does not
claim to replace the Step 7.5 quality review.)

#### Step 7.5a: Dispatch dual reviewers (parallel)

For each post produced in Steps 6 + 7 (1 roundup + N deep-stories,
max 3), dispatch **2 independent reviewer sub-agents** with
`subagent_type: general-purpose` and **`model: "opus"` required**.
Reviewer quality judgment (Axis 2 structural coherence, Axis 4 depth
vs. paraphrase, Axis 6 anti-template) is a design-grade task. Running
reviewer on the same model family as author also produces LLM-judging-LLM
bias — using Opus widens the judgment-power gap now that author defaults
to Sonnet. If Opus is unavailable at dispatch time, report BLOCKED rather
than fall back. Each reviewer's brief follows the template in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/daily-news/references/content-reviewer-brief.md`
with the per-post values substituted.

Total batch size: 2 × (1 + N) reviewer sub-agents, all dispatched in
ONE response (single message with multiple `Agent` tool blocks).

Each reviewer:
- Tools: Read only
- Reads: post HTML + sidecar + rubric file + archetype reference (if
  deep-story) + persona file + ledger spine (deep-story only)
- Does NOT read: other posts, exemplars, other reviewer's output
- Emits: ONE JSON object per the rubric's "Reviewer output format"
  schema

#### Step 7.5b: Consolidate dual-reviewer findings

For each post, parent receives 2 reviewer outputs. For each axis:
- `consensus_score = min(reviewer_A.score, reviewer_B.score)` (lower
  = stricter gate)
- `disagreement = |reviewer_A.score - reviewer_B.score|`

If `disagreement >= 2` on any axis, record for PR body:
`<output_path> Axis <name>: reviewer-A=<A>, reviewer-B=<B>`.

Derive per-post `overall` from consensus scores using the rubric's
band semantics:
- Any consensus axis <= 3 → BLOCKING
- Otherwise any consensus axis 4-6 → IMPORTANT
- Otherwise any consensus axis 7-8 → PASS-with-notes
- All consensus >= 9 → PASS

#### Step 7.5c: Per-post retry loop

For each post with `overall` BLOCKING or IMPORTANT, construct a retry
brief for the author sub-agent. The retry brief is the post's
original brief (from Step 7a — held by parent) PLUS:

- The current `output_path` (existing draft is the starting point)
- The reviewer findings: each weak axis, its consensus score, both
  reviewers' justifications
- Explicit instruction on the target level (axis must reach >= 7 to
  exit BLOCKING; >= 7 to exit IMPORTANT)
- Permission to keep widgets unchanged unless reviewer findings cite
  widget content (most prose findings should not touch widgets)
- For Axis 8 (zh-TW prose) findings: the retry must obey
  zh-tw-prose.md §1 — fix by deletion and rewriting only. Inventing
  numbers, scenes, or quotes to "add texture" is fabrication and
  forbidden; every concrete detail must come from the source material.

Parent dispatches retry author sub-agents in parallel (one per post
needing retry) — **same `model: "sonnet"` requirement as Step 7b**.
After all retries return, re-dispatch the dual reviewers (Step 7.5a,
also Opus) for each retried post; consolidate again (Step 7.5b).

Iteration budget per post:
- **BLOCKING**: up to 5 retry rounds. If still BLOCKING after 5 →
  drop this post (N → N-1). Log to PR body under
  `## Step 7.5 Blocking drops`.
- **IMPORTANT**: up to 3 retry rounds. If still IMPORTANT after 3 →
  accept the current draft, log to PR body under
  `## Content Quality Concerns`.
- **PASS-with-notes / PASS**: no retry; logged for transparency only.

If a reviewer emits malformed JSON: re-dispatch that reviewer up to 2
extra times. If still malformed, treat as a vote of BLOCKING on that
post (drop the post).

If the roundup itself reaches BLOCKING and exhausts retries: this is
a routine failure. Do NOT open PR. Report BLOCKED status with the
roundup's blocking axes.

#### Step 7.5d: Inter-post diversity check (only when N_final >= 2)

After all per-post retries settle, count the number of deep-stories
still in the batch (`N_final`). If `N_final >= 2`, dispatch ONE
inter-post reviewer sub-agent (**`model: "opus"` required**, same
rationale as Step 7.5a) with the inter-post brief variant from
`content-reviewer-brief.md`. It scores Axis 7 only.

If `batch_score < 7`:
1. Identify `most_similar_post` from the reviewer output.
2. Construct a retry brief: original brief + "find another angle"
   instruction + the inter-post reviewer's justification on what
   makes this post too-similar-to-others.
3. Dispatch one retry author sub-agent for that post (Opus, per
   Step 7b).
4. Re-dispatch the inter-post reviewer (Opus, per above).
5. Up to 2 inter-post retry rounds. If still `batch_score < 7`
   after round 2, accept and log to
   `## Inter-post diversity concerns`.

`N_final = 1` → skip Step 7.5d entirely.

#### Step 7.5e: Collate findings for PR body

Parent now has, for each surviving post:
- Final per-axis consensus scores
- Final overall status
- Retry rounds run
- Reviewer disagreement notes (if any axis disagreed by >= 2)

And, if N_final >= 2:
- Final batch_score
- Inter-post retries run

These populate the PR body sections defined in Step 9's template
(see Step 9 prose).

#### Failure modes for Step 7.5

| Scenario | Handling |
|---|---|
| One reviewer emits malformed JSON | Re-dispatch that reviewer (up to 2 retries). Still malformed → treat as BLOCKING vote on that post. |
| Both reviewers crash on one post | Treat as BLOCKING for that post. Drop the post if it's a deep-story; abort routine if it's the roundup. |
| All N deep-stories blocking-drop | Routine continues with roundup-only PR; PR title says "(0 deep stories)" and PR body documents the drops. |
| Roundup blocking-drops | BLOCKED — do NOT open PR. Report status with roundup's blocking axes. |
| Reviewer dispatch returns no output (network / tool failure) | Re-dispatch that reviewer once. Still nothing → treat as BLOCKING vote. |

### Step 7.6: Fact-check gate (trace + authenticity)

After Step 7.5 settles (prose is final modulo fact fixes), verify the
posts against their reading ledgers, and the ledgers against the
world. Authors built the ledgers while reading (Step 7b); this step
proves the post only asserts what the notes contain (trace) and that
the notes' quotes are real (authenticity). The standard lives in
`references/fact-check.md`; the checker contract in
`references/fact-check-brief.md`. Ledgers are committed next to the
posts (`<slug>.ledger.json`) — they are PR-review evidence and the
site's re-verification record.

**No skip clause exists.** Same enforcement rule as Steps 7.5/8.5:
if wall-clock or budget is tight, drop deep-stories (N → N-1) so the
remaining gate fits — never ship unverified claims to ship more
posts. `check-quality-gate-evidence.mjs` fails when ledgers are
missing; `check-claim-ledger.mjs` fails when they are incomplete or
unresolved.

#### Step 7.6a: Dispatch fact-check sub-agents (parallel)

For each post (1 roundup + N deep-stories), dispatch **1 checker
sub-agent** with `subagent_type: general-purpose` and **`model:
"opus"` required** (hedge-strength and source-independence judgment
is design-grade; if Opus is unavailable, report BLOCKED rather than
fall back). All ≤4 dispatches in ONE response. Each checker (tools:
Read + WebFetch only):

- **Trace pass** — extracts load-bearing claims from the post and
  binds each to ledger notes (`note_ids`); unbound + unmarked =
  trace failure.
- **Authenticity pass** — re-fetches every ledger source; verifies
  each used note's `quote` is really in the source at the recorded
  `hedge` strength; judges independence (echo ≠ corroboration) and
  timeliness; fills any `archive_url` the author left null.
- For the roundup: creates `roundup.ledger.json` (claims-only — no
  notes/spine), ≥1 claim per item lede verified against the item's
  source URL.
- Emits the completed ledger JSON; the parent writes it back to
  `ledger_path`.

#### Step 7.6b: Apply the action matrix

Parent walks the returned claims: every claim whose `action` ≠
`none` needs a fix per the fact-check.md action matrix (high-load
`unverifiable` → correct from source or delete; unmarked `inferred`
→ mark as inference or delete; `hedge_delta: inflated` → restore the
note's hedging strength; high-load `pending` → alternate source or
visible hedged attribution).

#### Step 7.6c: Fix loop

For each post with actionable claims, dispatch one retry author
sub-agent (Opus, per Step 7b) whose brief contains the claim list,
each claim's verdict + evidence + bound notes, and the **fix
discipline**: deletion, hedging, marking-as-inference, or correcting
to what the note's quote actually says ONLY — a fix may not
introduce facts, numbers, or quotes absent from the ledger
(zh-tw-prose.md §1). Trace failures may also be fixed by ADDING a
note — but only with a verbatim quote from a re-fetched source.
After fixes, re-dispatch the checker with the re-check variant brief
(fixed claims only); parent merges verdicts and updates each claim's
`resolution`, bumping `checker_rounds`.

Iteration budget: up to **3 rounds** per post. A high-load
`unverifiable` claim that survives 3 rounds drops the post
(N → N-1), logged under `## Step 7.6 Fact-check drops`; if that post
is the roundup, the routine is BLOCKED — do NOT open PR. Fixes here
are deletions/hedges/corrections, narrow by construction — they do
not re-trigger Step 7.5.

#### Step 7.6d: Mechanical validation

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/daily-news/scripts/check-claim-ledger.mjs src/posts/YYYY/MM/DD/
```

Validates every committed ledger: schema + enums, spine 5-7, one
perspective set per source, notes integrity (verbatim quote, hedge,
interpretation separation), trace binding (`note_ids` non-empty or
verdict `inferred`), coverage arithmetic, claim floors (deep ≥
min(10, candidates); roundup ≥ item count), and resolution rules (no
surviving high-load `unverifiable`, no `pending-fix`,
`accepted-with-flag` only for medium/low-load `pending`). Exit 1 =
the discipline is not done; the fix is to finish it, never to edit
ledger fields to pass.

#### Failure modes for Step 7.6

| Scenario | Handling |
|---|---|
| Author sub-agent returns post but no ledger (or unparseable) | Treat as BLOCKED for that post in Step 7c — re-dispatch the brief; the ledger is not optional output. |
| Checker emits malformed JSON | Re-dispatch that checker (up to 2 retries). Still malformed → treat the post as unverified: drop it (deep-story) or BLOCK (roundup). |
| All ledger sources unreachable on re-fetch | Every claim is `pending`. High-load pendings need alternate sources or hedged attribution; if the post's core claims can't be supported, drop the post. |
| Archive (web.archive.org) fails or times out | Non-blocking. `archive_url: null`, move on — the gate warns but does not fail. |
| High-load `unverifiable` survives 3 fix rounds | Drop the post (N → N-1); roundup → BLOCKED, no PR. |

### Step 8: Self-check (mechanical)

Run the validation scripts:

```bash
# Dedup check (catches anything missed in step 3)
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/daily-news/scripts/check-dup.mjs src/posts/YYYY/MM/DD/

# zh-TW prose check (zh-CN terms + AI-boilerplate phrases; flag terms listed for judgment)
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/daily-news/scripts/check-zh-prose.mjs src/posts/YYYY/MM/DD/

# Schema/structure check
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/daily-news/scripts/publish.mjs src/posts/YYYY/MM/DD/

# HTML validity + archetype + link check
npx @11ty/eleventy
npx html-validate "_site/**/*.html"
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/tests/archetype-check.mjs _site/
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/tests/link-check.mjs

# Fact-check ledger validation (re-run of Step 7.6d — cheap, keep it in
# the battery so a post-7.6 edit can't silently invalidate a ledger)
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/daily-news/scripts/check-claim-ledger.mjs src/posts/YYYY/MM/DD/

# Quality-gate evidence: enforces that Steps 7.5, 7.6, and 8.5 actually ran
# (reviewer JSON + fact-check ledgers + screenshot artifacts present on
# disk). Exits 1 if any post lacks evidence. Run this AFTER Steps 7.5, 7.6,
# and 8.5 have completed and BEFORE the commit / PR step.
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/daily-news/scripts/check-quality-gate-evidence.mjs src/posts/YYYY/MM/DD/
```

If any step fails: fix the underlying content, re-run. Do not commit while
checks fail.

`check-quality-gate-evidence.mjs` failing means the routine skipped a
quality pass. The fix is **never** "delete the gate" or "stub the
artifacts"; the fix is to actually run Step 7.5 / 7.6 / 8.5, or to drop
deep stories until what remains fits the budget the routine can pay.

### Step 8.5: Visual self-review (Playwright + multimodal)

Mechanical checks (Step 8) catch broken HTML and missing structure; they
do NOT catch visual regressions like SVG widgets invisible in dark mode,
text overflow, layout collapse, or unreadable contrast. Step 8.5 closes
that gap by having Claude open each rendered page in Playwright, take a
screenshot, and look at it.

**No skip clause exists.** Same enforcement rule as Step 7.5: if
wall-clock is tight, drop deep-stories (N → N-1) so the audit fits,
never skip the audit to ship more posts. PR #32 (2026-05-22) declared
the visual audit as "(Minor) deferred" with the rationale "the
mechanical semantic invariants cover the highest-risk visual failures"
— this is false. The mechanical scripts cover SVG legibility floor +
text overflow only; they do not catch grid-track conflicts, breakout
overflow, dark-mode contrast, viewport-scroll regressions, or any
class of layout bug that is visible at a glance in a screenshot but
invisible to per-element DOM measurement. The 2026-05-22 C# widget
shipped with desktop SVG squeezed to 409 px in a 1.3fr-1fr grid (vs
intended 960 px full-width) — the post-merge screenshot revealed it
in one second; the routine's mechanical PASS hid it completely.

If you find yourself thinking "I already ran the mechanical scripts so
the visual pass is lower priority" — that is the rationalization this
clause forbids. **Mechanical and visual passes are not substitutes
for each other**; they catch disjoint failure modes by construction.

**Scope clarification (added 2026-05-23 after PR #35)**: same scope
rule as Step 7.5. This clause authorizes trimming N when *runtime
evidence* shows a Blocking visual issue genuinely can't be fixed in 5
iterations. It does NOT authorize Step 5 preemptive trimming on
"Step 8.5 will be expensive with N posts" reasoning. Step 5c's
"Trimming N below 3 is ONLY legitimate when…" list is the only
authorization for sub-3 in Step 5.

**Setup**:

```bash
npm run dev > /tmp/vg-dev-selfreview.log 2>&1 &
sleep 2 && curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost:8080/
# ^ expect 200; otherwise tear down and BLOCK
```

**For each published post** (roundup + each deep-story):

1. Navigate Playwright to `http://localhost:8080/YYYY/MM/DD/<slug>/`
2. Initial viewport screenshot in light mode (default)
3. Switch to dark via **both** `localStorage` AND `data-theme` attribute —
   the site reads `localStorage` only on page load and then applies
   `data-theme` to `<html>`, so post-load `localStorage` change alone does
   nothing. Use:
   ```js
   localStorage.setItem("vg-theme", "dark");
   document.documentElement.setAttribute("data-theme", "dark");
   ```
   Then take initial viewport screenshot.
4. For widgets below the fold (deep-stories often have widgets 800–1500px
   down): use `document.querySelector('.vg-w-...').scrollIntoView()` then
   screenshot the **viewport**, not the element. Element-level screenshots
   (`target=` in playwright) are unreliable when multiple `<figure>` or
   `<svg>` elements exist on the page (strict-mode selector violation).
5. **Mobile audit — every deep-story, every widget** (added 2026-05-20
   after PR #23/#24/#25 surfaced widespread mobile issues):

   a. Resize browser to **375×812** (iPhone SE / small phone).

   b. For each deep-story, navigate to the post URL.

   c. For each widget inside `.vg-post-body figure[class*="vg-w-"]`:
      - `widget.scrollIntoView({ block: 'center' })`
      - Wait ~300ms for any sticky / IntersectionObserver to settle.
      - Take a viewport screenshot.
      - **Look at the screenshot**. Check:
        - Is every SVG label / axis / chart annotation readable?
          (Wide-aspect viewBox ≥4:1 widgets crush at 375px to ~80px
          tall — labels collide. See tier-3 §12.1.D-pre for fix
          patterns.)
        - Are tap targets ≥ 32px? (range thumbs, buttons, divider
          handles, SVG clickable rects.)
        - Does the widget overflow horizontally? (any `bb.right > 400`)
        - For scroll-driven widgets: does the sticky figure stay
          visible below the site header (not hidden behind chrome)?
          Site header is `position: sticky; top: 0; z-index: 50` ~100px
          tall — sticky widget figures must use `top: var(--vg-header-h)`
          per tier-3 §12.1.B.

   d. Also scroll past each scroll-driven widget's stages and verify
      the active stage class actually changes as the reader scrolls
      (IntersectionObserver mobile rootMargin per §12.1.E).

   e. **Semantic invariants — mechanical** (added 2026-05-21 after PR #30):
      run the two semantic-invariant scripts against every published
      page. These catch classes of failure that visual screenshot
      review systematically misses (because screenshots are
      downsampled and human reviewers pattern-match on "looks roughly
      right" rather than measuring).

      **(i) SVG legibility floor**: smallest text inside every
      `vg-w-*` SVG must render at ≥ 11 effective px on a 375 viewport.

      ```bash
      node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/daily-news/scripts/measure-svg-legibility.mjs \
        http://localhost:8080/YYYY/MM/DD/<roundup-slug>/ \
        http://localhost:8080/YYYY/MM/DD/<deep-slug-1>/ \
        http://localhost:8080/YYYY/MM/DD/<deep-slug-2>/ \
        > /tmp/vg-legibility.json
      # exit 1 = at least one figure below the 11 px hard floor
      ```

      The script emits one JSON line per figure on stderr and an
      aggregate verdict on stdout. PASS = ≥ 11 effective px (target);
      SOFT-PASS = 10.0–11.0 (acceptable for deliberate calibration);
      FAIL = < 10 px. Fix by adding or bumping `data-svg-scroll="<min-px>"`
      on the `<figure>` per `references/design-system.md` § Mobile
      legibility floor. Treat any FAIL as a Blocking-tier issue.

      **(ii) SVG text overflow**: no `<text>` inside a `vg-w-*` figure
      may extend more than 2 SVG units past the right edge of the
      `<rect>` that semantically contains it.

      ```bash
      node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/daily-news/scripts/check-svg-text-overflow.mjs \
        http://localhost:8080/YYYY/MM/DD/<deep-slug-1>/ \
        http://localhost:8080/YYYY/MM/DD/<deep-slug-2>/ \
        > /tmp/vg-overflow.json
      # exit 1 = at least one text overflows its owning rect
      ```

      Fix per `widget-cookbook/tier-3-principles.md` §12.1.D-bis:
      shorten the label, drop font-size (within legibility floor),
      move outside the rect, or split into stacked `<text>` lines.

      **(iii) Desktop grid + `data-svg-scroll` mutual exclusion** (added
      after the 2026-05-22 C# unsafe widget shipped a 1.3fr-1fr grid
      with `data-svg-scroll="720"`; on a ~880 px desktop figure the
      left track is only ~497 px, so the 720 px-min SVG overflowed and
      triggered an unintended horizontal scrollbar). The
      `data-svg-scroll="N"` rule sets `min-width: N px` on every
      descendant `<svg>` — that floor is measured against the
      containing grid track, not the figure. If the figure is itself a
      multi-column grid on desktop, the SVG can't fit and either spills
      or forces the figure's `overflow-x: auto` open. The
      `widget-cookbook/anti-examples.md` "Two-column grid + scroll"
      pattern documents the rule verbally; this script enforces it
      mechanically.

      ```bash
      node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/daily-news/scripts/check-grid-svgscroll-conflict.mjs \
        http://localhost:8080/YYYY/MM/DD/<deep-slug-1>/ \
        http://localhost:8080/YYYY/MM/DD/<deep-slug-2>/ \
        > /tmp/vg-grid-scroll.json
      # exit 1 = at least one figure combines desktop multi-column
      # grid with data-svg-scroll
      ```

      Fix by either (a) dropping `data-svg-scroll` if the SVG is
      readable in the desktop track at its natural width, or (b)
      collapsing the desktop grid to a single column so the SVG spans
      the full figure. Treat as Blocking.

      **(iv) SVG text-vs-text collision** (added 2026-06-15): no two
      `<text>` inside the same `vg-w-*` SVG may overlap by more than 1
      AND 3 viewBox user-units (horizontal AND vertical). Overlap is
      measured with `getBBox()` in the SVG's own viewBox space, so the
      threshold is viewport-independent. The 3-unit vertical floor
      tolerates a deliberate two-line description at the same cx (normal
      line spacing). This catches the smear that legibility and overflow
      scripts miss — two `text-anchor="middle"` labels placed at
      hand-picked cx closer than they are wide.

      ```bash
      node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/daily-news/scripts/check-svg-text-collision.mjs \
        http://localhost:8080/YYYY/MM/DD/<deep-slug-1>/ \
        http://localhost:8080/YYYY/MM/DD/<deep-slug-2>/ \
        > /tmp/vg-collision.json
      # exit 1 = at least one text-vs-text collision.
      # stdout JSON carries figures_inspected; a "WARNING: inspected 0
      # figures" on stderr means the page never loaded — not a real PASS.
      ```

      Fix by spreading anchors across the viewBox, staggering one label
      above/below the axis with a leader line, or end-anchoring a single
      colliding label. Treat as Blocking.

      **(v) Drag-handle coordinate target** (added 2026-06-15): a widget
      that does `getScreenCTM` coordinate math must NOT grab its svg with
      a bare `querySelector('svg')` when its figure holds more than one
      `<svg>` (e.g. an affordance-icon svg as the first svg). The bare
      query grabs the wrong svg and the drag handle lands off the cursor.
      Disambiguate by selecting a class-qualified svg
      (`querySelector('svg.vg-w-<name>-main')`, or any `svg.<class>`).

      ```bash
      node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/daily-news/scripts/check-svg-coordinate-target.mjs \
        http://localhost:8080/YYYY/MM/DD/<deep-slug-1>/ \
        http://localhost:8080/YYYY/MM/DD/<deep-slug-2>/ \
        > /tmp/vg-coordinate.json
      # exit 1 = a coord-transform widget with >1 svg uses a bare svg query
      ```

      Fix by giving the main svg a class and selecting it explicitly.
      Treat as Blocking.

      **(vi) Static widget scan** (added 2026-06-15): runs on the post
      *source* files (no browser). Flags `vg-w-table-*` figures rendered
      as `<pre>` instead of a real `<table>`, and SVG `role=button`
      widgets with `data-target` rects but no bridge script. The dead-
      button check is file-level — a clean result proves at least one
      `getAttribute('data-target')` bridge exists in the file, not that
      every SVG-button widget is individually wired.

      ```bash
      node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/daily-news/scripts/check-widget-static.mjs \
        src/posts/YYYY/MM/DD/ \
        > /tmp/vg-widget-static.json
      # exit 1 = at least one fake-table or dead-svg-button finding
      ```

      Fix the fake table by rebuilding it as a real `<table>`; fix the
      dead button by adding the radio-bridge script. Treat as Blocking.

   f. **Touch-tier audit — true touch emulation** (added 2026-06-12,
      static-tier spec): the 375px *resize* in (a)–(c) does NOT trigger
      the touch CSS (`hover: none / pointer: coarse` is capability
      detection, not width).

      Open a NEW device-emulated browser context for this step — do
      NOT reuse the resized desktop window:

      ```js
      const { chromium, devices } = require("@playwright/test");
      const browser = await chromium.launch();
      const ctx = await browser.newContext({ ...devices["iPhone 13"] });
      const page = await ctx.newPage();
      ```

      Per deep-story: navigate, then scrollIntoView + screenshot every
      `.vg-post-body figure[class*="vg-w-"]`, every `.vg-mobile-card`,
      and the `.vg-mobile-notice`. LOOK at the screenshots and check
      per tier:
      - `keep`: figure visible; NO control remnants（slider、checkbox、
        radio、button 全藏乾淨，無空白破洞）; text passes the box-test
        (no text-vs-text / text-vs-box overlap, nothing clipped).
      - `static`: all `keep` checks, PLUS — figure 有 `data-svg-scroll`
        且可橫向滑到最右端；預設狀態讀得懂——verdict/annotation 文字是
        有意義的預設值，不是空白或 placeholder。
      - `swap`: card shows title + summary, NO per-card desktop hint;
        top notice appears exactly once.

   g. Record findings for the post in the issue list (see severity
      tiering below).

6. **Roundup mobile check**: navigate to roundup at 375px, screenshot
   the donut + top 3 item cards. Verify section labels render,
   read-tracker buttons inject correctly, no horizontal scroll.

**Look at each screenshot. Classify any issues by severity**:

| Tier | Examples | Loop behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Blocking** | Element overlap obscuring text; text cut off mid-character; SVG widget completely invisible (white-on-white in light mode, dark-on-dark in dark mode); page renders blank or with browser console errors; layout collapse where one column eats another | Fix the underlying CSS/HTML; rebuild; re-screenshot; re-classify. Up to **5 iterations**. If still blocking after 5 → stop and report BLOCKED status (do NOT open PR). |
| **Important** | Awkward but readable spacing; SVG renders but legend overflows; sticky header overlaps card title on scroll; CJK wrap breaking a code identifier ugly | Fix in current iteration. Up to **3 iterations**. If still present after 3 → note in PR body under `## Visual Concerns` and continue to PR. |
| **Minor** | Drop cap baseline 2-3px off; tag chip vertical alignment imperfect; line-height slightly tight | Record only. Note in PR body, do NOT iterate. |

**When retrofitting / fixing existing posts (not just authoring new ones)**:
the Step 8.5 audit MUST be re-run on every post that was modified. This
applies to bulk widget retrofits, prose trims, density refactors, mobile
fixes — any change that touches a post's HTML. Mechanical checks alone
(Step 8) are insufficient because they do not look at the rendered page.

PRs #23/#24/#25 each surfaced issues that would have been caught by a
proper Step 8.5 audit but weren't because retrofits skipped Step 8.5:
- Wide viewBox widgets crushed on mobile
- Sticky figure hidden behind site header
- Range thumbs untappable

Rule: if you modify N posts, you run Step 8.5 on N posts. No exceptions.

**Iteration budget rationale**: 5 blocking-tier iterations covers real-world
fix cycles (a wrong CSS selector → rebuild → re-screenshot → still wrong →
another CSS attempt → success usually fits in 2-3 rounds; 5 is the hard
ceiling so the routine doesn't infinite-loop on an unfixable case). 3
important-tier iterations keeps quality bar without spending all run-time
on polish. Minor issues never iterate — they belong in human review.

**Inter-iteration discipline**: each fix must be a deliberate, named change
("changed `.vg-card-roundup` grid columns from 3rem 1fr to 4rem 1fr to fix
overlap of #NN numeral with title at narrow viewports"). Do NOT change
multiple unrelated things in one iteration — if fix doesn't work, you won't
know which change was wrong.

**Tear down**:

```bash
kill $(lsof -ti:8080) 2>/dev/null
```

**Record findings**: keep a list of any Important + Minor issues to write
into the PR body. Blocking issues should be all-fixed before reaching
Step 9 (or the run should have BLOCKED out).

### Step 9: Open PR

```bash
git checkout -b daily/YYYY-MM-DD
git add src/posts/YYYY/MM/DD/
git commit -m "daily: YYYY-MM-DD news (1 roundup + N deep stories)"
git push -u origin daily/YYYY-MM-DD
gh pr create --base main --title "daily: YYYY-MM-DD news (1 roundup + N deep stories)" --body "<see body template below>"
```

**PR body template** — include all sections:

```markdown
## 今日 10 則 (roundup)

01. {{title}} — {{source_url}}
02. ...
...

## 深入文章 (deep-stories)

### {{deep_title_1}}

Lede: {{deep_lede_1}}

### {{deep_title_2}}

Lede: {{deep_lede_2}}

## 跳過 (dup with last 7 days)

- {{skipped_url}} — title similarity 0.91 vs "{{past_title}}"
- (none) if no skips

## Domain distribution

AI · 3 · SYSTEMS · 3 · INFRA · 2 · WEB · 1 · BACKEND · 1

## Domains skipped today

- (none) — or list each: e.g., "WEB: no qualifying candidates"

## Domains capped (≤6 rule)

- (none) — or list e.g., "AI: 8 qualifying, top 6 selected"

## 來源使用

- HackerNoon: 18 candidates → 4 selected
- Hacker News: 12 candidates → 2 selected
- Cloudflare blog: 5 candidates → 1 selected
- ...
- Failed: (none) or list of failed-fetch sources

## Step 8.5 Visual Audit Evidence (REQUIRED — no "deferred" allowed)

This section MUST list, for every published post, the screenshot
artifacts produced in Step 8.5. Empty or "skipped" or "deferred" is an
INVALID PR — the publish gate (`check-quality-gate-evidence.mjs`) will
fail if the screenshot directory is empty.

For each post:
- `<output_path>` — desktop (1280×900) and mobile (375×812), light + dark,
  plus one viewport screenshot per widget. Format:
  ```
  /2026/MM/DD/<slug>/
    desktop-light.png · desktop-dark.png
    mobile-light.png · mobile-dark.png
    widget-<vg-w-name>-desktop.png · widget-<vg-w-name>-mobile.png  (× N widgets)
  ```
  Screenshots live under `/tmp/vg-audit-YYYY-MM-DD/<slug>/`. Full
  path list goes here; do not summarize.

### Visual issues found (and fixed during the audit)

- (none) — or list each issue with affected page URL + screenshot path +
  what was fixed. Example:
- `/2026/05/22/deep-csharp-memory-safety-net11/` (desktop 1280): the
  `.vg-w-annotated-csharp-unsafe-contracts` widget rendered SVG at
  409 px in a 1.3fr-1fr grid track instead of full-width.
  Fix: replaced desktop grid with `display: flex; flex-direction: column`
  so the wide-aspect SVG spans the figure and the detail panel sits
  beneath it. Re-screenshot in
  `/tmp/vg-audit-2026-05-22/deep-csharp-memory-safety-net11/widget-annotated-csharp-unsafe-contracts-desktop.png`
  confirms 960 px SVG, no horizontal scroll. Blocking-tier; 1 iteration.

### Visual issues accepted (Important/Minor — NOT skipped)

Issues here mean the visual audit DID run, found something, AND a
decision was made to ship anyway with the issue documented. This is
different from skipping the audit. List with severity + screenshot
path + rationale for accepting.

- (none) — or list each.

## Step 7.5 Content Quality Review (REQUIRED — no "skipped" allowed)

This section MUST contain dual-reviewer per-axis scores for every
post. Empty or "skipped" or "deviation declared" is an INVALID PR —
the publish gate (`check-quality-gate-evidence.mjs`) will fail if the
reviewer JSON artifacts under `/tmp/vg-quality-YYYY-MM-DD/` are
missing.

Wall-clock or Opus-budget pressure is NOT a valid reason to omit this
section. If the routine cannot afford full reviewer dispatches for N
deep-stories, the routine MUST drop deep-stories until N fits the
budget, per Step 7.5 "No skip clause exists" paragraph. Shipping more
posts at lower quality-assurance is forbidden.

For each post (roundup + deep-stories):
- `<output_path>` — final status: PASS / PASS-with-notes / IMPORTANT-accepted / BLOCKED-dropped
  - Axis 1 (Hook): <consensus-score> (A=<a>, B=<b>) — "<short justification>"
  - Axis 2 (Structural, <archetype>): <consensus-score> (A=<a>, B=<b>) — "<short justification>"
  - Axis 3 (Material): <consensus-score> (A=<a>, B=<b>)
  - Axis 4 (Depth): <consensus-score> (A=<a>, B=<b>)
  - Axis 5 (Relevance, <dimension>): <consensus-score> (A=<a>, B=<b>)
  - Axis 6 (Anti-template): <consensus-score> (A=<a>, B=<b>)
  - Axis 8 (zh-TW prose): <consensus-score> (A=<a>, B=<b>) — "<short justification>"
  - (Axis 7 inter-post diversity: see § Inter-post diversity concerns below)
  - Reviewer JSON artifacts: `/tmp/vg-quality-YYYY-MM-DD/<slug>-reviewer-A.json`, `<slug>-reviewer-B.json`
  - Retry rounds: <N>

## Step 7.5 Blocking drops

- (none) — or list: `<output_path>` (archetype), blocking axes, final scores, attempted retries

## Content Quality Concerns

- (none) — or list each post with axes still 4-6 after retry budget exhausted

## Reviewer disagreements

- (none) — or list: `<output_path>` Axis <name>: reviewer-A=<A>, reviewer-B=<B>. Human reviewer should look closely.

## Inter-post diversity concerns

- (none) — or batch_score=<N>, attempted retries=<M>, final state notes.

## Step 7.6 Fact-check (REQUIRED — no "skipped" allowed)

This section MUST contain per-post ledger summaries. Empty or
"skipped" is an INVALID PR — `check-quality-gate-evidence.mjs` fails
when ledgers are missing and `check-claim-ledger.mjs` fails when they
are unresolved.

For each post (roundup + deep-stories):
- `<output_path>` — claims checked: <N> (of <M> candidates; <K> dropped low-load)
  - trace: <N-bound> bound to notes · <N-inferred> marked inferred · <N-trace-failures> trace failures fixed
  - verdicts: 已核實 <n1> · 待核實 <n2> · 推斷 <n3> · 不可核實 <n4>
  - fixes applied: <list each — corrected / hedged / marked-inferred / deleted, with claim id + one-line what>
  - accepted-with-flag: <list each pending medium/low-load claim the human should eyeball, with its source>
  - unarchived sources: <list each archive_url: null, or (none)>
  - Ledger: `src/posts/YYYY/MM/DD/<slug>.ledger.json` (committed — review the diff)
  - Checker rounds: <N>

## Step 7.6 Fact-check drops

- (none) — or list: `<output_path>`, the claim(s) that could not be
  corrected or deleted in 3 rounds, and the verdict evidence.

## Deep-story archetypes used today

- {{deep_title_1}} — `narrative`
- {{deep_title_2}} — `technical-deep-dive`
- {{deep_title_3}} — `freeform` (hybrid topic, no structured archetype fit cleanly)

## Deep-story count justification (REQUIRED when N_final < 3)

The default deep-story count is N = 3. If N_final < 3, this section
MUST contain exactly one of the named structural reasons below.
`check-quality-gate-evidence.mjs` enforces this mechanically: a sub-3
run with no listed reason (or with a "budget/wallclock/dispatch cost"
reason) fails the publish gate.

- Target: N = 3
- Actual: N = <number>
- Reason (only if Actual < Target; pick exactly one):
  - `<3 score-qualifying clusters: <list cluster IDs + their scores>`
  - `domain/archetype diversity unsatisfiable: <enumerate combinations tried>`
  - `Step 5d URL collision with refill pool exhausted: <details>`
  - `Step 7.5 BLOCKING retry exhausted on <slug> after 5 rounds`
  - `Step 8.5 Blocking visual issue unfixable after 5 iterations on <slug>`
  - `Step 7.6 fact-check: high-load unverifiable claim unresolved after 3 rounds on <slug>`

"Budget" / "wallclock" / "dispatch cost" / "Opus quota" is NOT a
valid Step 5 reason — see SKILL.md Step 5c. If you wrote one of those
phrases here, the routine has a bug in Step 5 and you should re-pick
deep stories at N = 3.

## Advisory overrides

Records every place where Claude overrode a `scripts/decisions/*.mjs`
module's output. Empty section = pure advisory consensus.

- (none) — or list each:
  - `score(2026-05-19-04)`: module said 9, kept 7. Reason: paraphrase, not
    original.
  - `cover-domains`: module dropped `2026-05-19-09` (backend, score 7); kept
    in selection. Reason: novel architectural pattern worth higher signal.
  - `archetype(deep-foo)`: 選了 `freeform` 而非 `narrative`,
    因為該題目沒有清晰時間線,強套 setup→mechanism→consequence 會讓 prose
    變成「凡是事件都套同一個 H2 序列」的模板感。

## Failure modes — explicit handling

| Scenario | Handling |
|---|---|
| Some sources fetch-fail | Skip them; log in PR body; require ≥5 successes overall |
| Fewer than 10 candidates pass scoring | Write actual N ("今日 7 則"); don't pad |
| Fewer than 3 deep-story candidates pass | Write 2 or 1; don't force |
| All sources fail | Fail-fast: no PR, no commit; report status |
| Dup filter excludes everything in a domain | Note in PR body; pick from other domains |
| html-validate fails | Self-fix one round; if still failing, open PR but flag `⚠ HTML validation failed` in title |
| Step 8.5 visual: blocking issue still present after 5 iterations | Stop. Do NOT open PR. Report BLOCKED status with the offending screenshot path so a human can inspect. |
| Step 8.5 visual: important issue still present after 3 iterations | Continue to Step 9. Write the issue into `## Visual Concerns` so reviewer knows. |
| Step 8.5 visual: dev server fails to start | BLOCKED — likely a build break; cannot self-review without a live server. |
| Step 7.5 content: all reviewer instances crash on one post | BLOCKED for that post. Drop that post if it's a deep-story; abort routine if it's the roundup. |
| Step 7.5 content: post fails 5 BLOCKING retries | Drop the post (N → N-1). Log to PR body. Routine continues. |
| Step 7.5 content: roundup fails 5 BLOCKING retries | Abort routine. Do NOT open PR. Report BLOCKED status. |
| Step 7.5 content: inter-post diversity fails 2 retries | Accept and log to PR body. Routine continues. |
| Step 7.6 fact-check: checker crashes or emits malformed JSON after retries | Treat the post as unverified: drop it if it's a deep-story; abort routine if it's the roundup. |
| Step 7.6 fact-check: high-load unverifiable claim survives 3 fix rounds | Drop the post (N → N-1); log to PR body. Roundup → abort routine, do NOT open PR. |

## Output expectations summary

A successful run produces:

- 1 × `roundup.html` + `roundup.11tydata.json` + `roundup.ledger.json`
  (claims-only, written by the Step 7.6 checker) in `src/posts/YYYY/MM/DD/`
- 0-3 × `deep-<slug>.html` + matching `.11tydata.json` + matching
  `.ledger.json` (the committed reading ledger; count may be reduced
  from intended N by Step 7.5 / 7.6 drops)
- One git branch `daily/YYYY-MM-DD` pushed to origin
- One PR open against `main` with the body template above filled in,
  including the five Step 7.5 content-quality sections and the two
  Step 7.6 fact-check sections

## Why this is split across multiple references

`SKILL.md` stays lean (workflow only) so it loads fast when the skill
triggers. Detailed rules (persona, sources, archetype HTML structures, dedup
math, design tokens, widget contract) live in `references/` files that load
on-demand when authoring decisions actually need them. This is the
"progressive disclosure" pattern: ~150 words always visible, ~1500 words
visible when skill activates, ~5000 words loadable as needed.

If a reference contradicts this SKILL.md, the reference wins for content
decisions (it is the detailed spec); SKILL.md wins for workflow ordering.
