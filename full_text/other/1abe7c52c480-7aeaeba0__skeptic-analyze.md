description: Skeptic analysis contract lock and execution. Use after formulate, protocol, clean, and examine to lock one executable analysis contract within upstream constraints and execute it, producing auditable outputs for route-appropriate PCS evaluation without widening the claim boundary or self-revising based on result quality. Use when Codex should run the Skeptic analyze stage as a standalone skill, including requests like skeptic analyze --auto to run this stage with autonomous cycle execution.
---


## Codex Invocation

Use this skill for `skeptic analyze`. If the user writes `skeptic analyze --auto`, run all cycles for the `analyze` stage without asking cycle-by-cycle questions; make autonomous pass/iterate decisions from the stage acceptance criteria and stop only for missing required inputs, blocking environment failures, or user-owned choices that cannot be inferred.

# /skeptic:analyze - Analysis Contract Lock and Execution

IMPORTANT: Before executing, read `references/core-principles.md`. `core-principles.md` is the architecture contract. If this file conflicts with it, `core-principles.md` wins.

## Guiding Principle

`analyze` translates the approved question, protocol contract, cleaned data, and examination handoff into one executable analysis specification, executes only that specification, and packages the outputs for `evaluate`. It does not self-revise based on result quality. Sensitivity divergence, challenger disagreement, and result magnitude are findings for `evaluate` to adjudicate. `analyze` handles execution-viability failures only: convergence failure, degenerate output, computational infeasibility.

## Stage Outputs

`analyze` writes exactly three project-side artifacts plus a README block.

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `{scripts_dir_name}/05_analysis.py` | Single Python file containing one function per cycle (`run_cycle_a`, `run_cycle_b`, `run_cycle_c`, `run_cycle_d`, `run_cycle_f`, plus any `run_cycle_eN` follow-ups). Invoked one cycle at a time. Returns a JSON evidence packet on stdout. |
| `{docs_dir_name}/05_analysis.yaml` | Canonical stage memory. Holds the locked contract, assumption results, primary/sensitivity/challenger outputs, deviations, amendments, claim boundary state, evaluation handoff, reproducibility result, cycle history, and PCS review. Created at stage start, updated at the end of every cycle. |
| `{docs_dir_name}/05_analysis.md` | Human-readable report. Rendered once at finalization from the canonical YAML. |
| `{readme_name}` | Short `## Analyze [COMPLETE]` block added at finalization. |

The canonical YAML is the single source of truth. If the rendered markdown disagrees with the YAML, the YAML wins.

## Required Inputs

| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Project folder path | Path to an existing project under the configured `projects_root` with completed `formulate`, `protocol`, `clean`, and `examine` stages |

`analyze` does not collect domain inputs directly. It reads them from upstream canonical YAMLs:

- `01_formulation.yaml`: approved question, question type, target quantity, claim boundary, route candidates, unit of analysis, decision context, key assumptions
- `02_protocol.yaml`: active route, data-usage mode, visibility rules, frozen artifacts, leakage rules, forbidden variable classes, validation logic, analyze contract-lock obligations, analyze claim limits, backtracking triggers, protocol-committed analyses
- `03_cleaning.yaml`: final visible artifact list, final variable list, population-shift summary, open questions
- `04_examination.yaml`: support registry (supported / weakly supported / unsupported), analysis handoff, analysis constraints, fragility verdicts, active-route pressure

Cycle A verifies each upstream artifact parses and contains the fields `analyze` depends on. If anything is missing, contradictory, or forces widening of the claim boundary, stop and reopen the affected upstream stage. Do not invent analysis permissions around gaps.

Cross-stage metric consistency rule: when recomputing a metric also computed in `examine` (baseline performance, prevalence rate, fold statistic), record the exact data subset and fold range used. If the recomputed value differs from `examine`'s value, record the reason explicitly. Unexplained discrepancies are a blocking defect.

## Canonical YAML Schema

`05_analysis.yaml` is the stage's memory. The model initializes it in Cycle A and extends it at the end of every cycle. The script never writes to this file.

Write only fields that apply to the project. Omit fields that would be null; readers treat a missing key as "not applicable." The schema below names every possible field; a concrete project will populate a subset.

```yaml

```

Each `decision_ledger` entry:

```yaml
- cycle:                            # cycle letter or follow-up id
  iteration:                        # 1-based per cycle id
  decision:                         # pass|iterate|acknowledge_gap|reopen_*|data_insufficient|archive|override
  blocking_failures:                # int (0 = PASS, >0 = FAIL)
  blocking_reason:                  # one-line reason when blocking_failures > 0, else null
  evidence_summary: {}              # compact material evidence only; no full JSON, DataFrames, arrays, or per-column schema dumps
  changed_fields: []                # canonical-YAML fields written or materially changed this iteration
  next_action:                      # next cycle, follow-up, finalization, or backtrack target
  # Optional: user_observations, decision_reason, override: {reason, criterion}, material_sources: [{url, claim}], rejected_alternatives: [{option, reason}]
```

Analytical findings belong in their destination fields. The decision ledger records only what changed, why the cycle did or did not close, and what happens next. Do not store full subagent replies, criterion-by-criterion PASS notes, or repeated script output in canonical YAML.
`pcs_review` when set:

```yaml
pcs_review:
  overall:                          # PASS|FAIL, satisfied|valid_concern|disagree_override, or route-specific terminal verdict
  blocking_findings: []             # compact list of failed checks or blocking concerns
  material_risks: []                # compact list of non-blocking risks worth carrying forward
  material_findings: []             # compact list of review findings that changed a decision or disposition
  full_review_pointer:              # optional; use only when a FAIL or override requires retaining full text outside the canonical YAML
  disposition:                      # satisfied|valid_concern|disagree_override
  disposition_reason:
```

Rules:
- The YAML must parse with a standard YAML loader after every write.
- `decision_ledger` is append-only. Superseded iterations stay in the list; new iterations append.
- `claim_boundary.narrowing_log_additions` is append-only within `analyze` and is merged into formulate's `claim_boundary.narrowing_log` at finalization.
- `contract` is set in Cycle A and may be amended only under the locked `contract.assumption_failure_policy`. Every amendment appends to `contract_amendments` and narrows the claim boundary if the fallback requires it.
- Write only fields that apply.
- Use only ASCII characters in generated YAML content. Replace em dashes with `--`, curly quotes with straight quotes. Source-data strings may keep non-ASCII when the encoding is declared.

## Cycle Structure

| Cycle | Focus | Mandatory |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| A | Contract Lock | Yes |
| B | Assumption Verification | Yes |
| C | Primary Execution | Yes |
| D | Sensitivity and Challenger Execution | Yes |
| F | Results Assembly, Reproducibility, Handoff | Yes |
| E1, E2, ... | Execution-issue Follow-ups | Conditional |

`E`-prefixed follow-ups are narrow execution-issue cycles opened only when Cycle C or Cycle D surfaces a material execution-viability problem (convergence failure, degenerate output, computational infeasibility, missing-data cascade). They are not a license for re-exploration or result-quality judgment.

## Per-cycle Reference Files

Before running cycle X, load only `cycles/{X}.yaml`. Each cycle YAML carries:

- `upstream`: canonical-YAML fields (including upstream-stage fields) that must be set before the cycle starts
- `setup_side_effects`: one-time actions (typically Cycle A only); omit when empty
- `required_evidence`: evidence keys or judgment outputs the cycle must produce
- `acceptance_criteria`: 3-5 verifiable conditions for cycle closure
- `writes`: mapping from evidence or judgment outputs to canonical-YAML fields
- `research_questions`: topics for the research subagent
- `guidance`: short, cycle-specific judgment rules
- decision-relevance check: for material judgments, name the plausible alternative most likely to change a downstream decision and store it in the relevant analytical field, not a new log
- `step4_additions`, `pcs_focus`, `log_extension`: present only when the cycle adds a specific discipline. `pcs_focus` holds cycle-specific PCS questions injected into the evaluation subagent prompt; it has no separate Step 5 application.

The stage entry (this file) is read once at stage start. Per-cycle files are loaded one at a time as each cycle runs.

Follow-up cycles use `cycles/E_template.yaml` as a starting shape. Materialize the concrete En spec inside the canonical YAML (not as a new file on disk) when a follow-up is opened.

## Cycle Protocol

This protocol applies to every cycle, mandatory or follow-up.

### Step 1: Setup and Execution

1. Read `cycles/{cycle}.yaml`.
2. Recover prior stage state:
   - Cycle A: read `01_formulation.yaml`, `02_protocol.yaml`, `03_cleaning.yaml`, `04_examination.yaml` once. Confirm each parses and contains the fields `analyze` depends on. Resolve exactly one `active_route` from `01_formulation.yaml` plus `02_protocol.yaml`; if they contradict or do not collapse to one route, stop and reopen `protocol`. Load `references/routes/{active_route}.md` once and keep it in memory for the rest of the stage.
   - First cycle entered in a fresh session (not Cycle A), or first cycle after a backtrack reopens the stage: read `05_analysis.yaml` once to recover the locked contract, assumption results, execution outputs, prior `decision_ledger`, and `status.active_route`; reload the same route file.
   - Every other case (continuing the same chat session): skip the re-read; the canonical YAML content is already in context from the cycle that just wrote it.
3. If the active route becomes ambiguous mid-stage, reread the four upstream canonical YAMLs and the same route file before proceeding. Do not guess.
4. Cycle A only: verify all upstream artifacts, hash each source file read into `provenance.upstream_artifacts`, derive and record `provenance.visibility_set`, initialize `05_analysis.yaml` with `stage`, `schema_version`, `project`, `status.current_cycle: A`, `status.active_route`, and create `05_analysis.py` with the shape specified below.
5. Every cycle: extend `05_analysis.py` by writing or updating the cycle's function (`run_cycle_a`, `run_cycle_b`, ...). The function must produce every required evidence key named by the cycle spec.
6. Run `python {scripts_dir_name}/05_analysis.py --cycle {cycle}`. Capture stdout.
7. Parse stdout as JSON. Use the parsed dict as this cycle's candidate evidence for Step 2 and Step 3; Step 5 records a compact summary in `decision_ledger[*].script_evidence`. Do not retain raw stdout by default. Write a debug sidecar only when the cycle fails, is rerun for diagnosis, or the user asks for retained raw evidence.
8. Scan stderr and stdout for unhandled exceptions. Any unhandled exception is a blocking defect and must be fixed before continuing. Functions that intentionally demonstrate failure must be explicitly flagged with a `# expected_failure` comment.

Script contract: generate `05_analysis.py` for the current project and follow `references/script-contract.md`. Include only the helpers needed for the locked analysis contract, visible artifacts, and active cycle evidence. Cycle F contains the reproducibility re-run logic for the executed contract.

Script rules:
- The script prints exactly one JSON object to stdout. Nothing else on stdout.
- The script does not write to `05_analysis.yaml`. Only the model writes the canonical YAML.
- The script reads only artifacts allowed by the protocol visibility referenced in `provenance.visibility_ref`. Touching a restricted artifact is a blocking defect.
- Heavy data (arrays, full DataFrames) is summarized, not dumped. Evidence packets stay compact.
- Per-file provenance (schema, encoding, sha256) is emitted only the first time a file is recorded -- typically Cycle A iter 1. After it lands in `provenance.files`, neither the stdout packet nor `decision_ledger[*].script_evidence` re-emits those fields; downstream cycles reference those files by filename.
- Seeds are set inside the function whenever stochastic steps run, and echoed into the evidence packet.
- Stable helper functions or sibling helper modules are allowed when they reduce duplication and improve reproducibility. Helpers must be deterministic, documented briefly, and must not write canonical YAML or access restricted artifacts.

### Step 2: Human Review

Interactive mode:
1. Present the script evidence inline, concisely.
2. Scan the evidence for ambiguities, decision points the model cannot resolve alone, and research topics worth seeding into Step 3 beyond the cycle's default research_questions.
3. If at least one such item exists, dispatch `AskUserQuestion` with 1-3 questions targeting them. Otherwise proceed directly to Step 3.
4. When AskUserQuestion was dispatched, record the user's answers as `user_observations` in the pending decision_ledger entry. Pass them into Step 3 subagent prompts via the `User observations:` field.

Auto mode: apply the self-review loop from `the `--auto` rule in this SKILL.md`. Self-correct within the configured budget, then proceed unless an escalation trigger fires.

### Step 3: Subagent Review

Run subagents only when the cycle risk warrants it. Use the research subagent only when outside domain or methodological information can materially change a decision. Use the evaluation subagent on high-risk cycles, unresolved blocking issues, or stage close; otherwise perform the acceptance-criteria check inline.

Research subagent:

```text
Agent(
  model="{subagent_model}",
  description="Methodological research for Analyze Cycle {X}: {focus}",
  run_in_background=true,
  prompt="""
  You are a methodological research assistant for a Skeptic analyze stage.

  Context:
  - Approved question: "{approved question}"
  - Question type: {question type}
  - Target quantity: {target quantity}
  - Claim boundary: {claim boundary}
  - Active route: {route}
  - Protocol mode: {data_usage_mode}
  - Visibility rules: {visibility summary}
  - Examination support summary: {supported/weakly/unsupported}
  - Analysis constraints: {from examine}
  - Current cycle script evidence: {compact summary of script_evidence}
  - User observations: {decision_ledger entry's user_observations from Step 2, or "none"}

  Answer these research questions for Cycle {X} ({focus}):
  {research_questions list from the cycle YAML}

  Rules:
  - Stay inside the approved question, protocol contract, and active route.
  - Focus on methodological guidance. Do not re-do domain discovery.
  - If a question does not apply, say "not applicable" with a one-line reason.
  - Create or reference a `research_log.jsonl` row only for sources that materially change a decision or will be cited in a deliverable; canonical YAML keeps only `research_log#n` pointers.

  Return concise findings organized by research question.

)
```

Evaluation subagent:

```text
Agent(
  model="{subagent_model}",
  description="Evaluation for Analyze Cycle {X}: {focus}",
  run_in_background=true,
  prompt="""
  You are an objective evaluator for a Skeptic analyze-stage cycle.

  Read:
  1. {projects_root}/{project-name}/{docs_dir_name}/05_analysis.yaml
  2. {projects_root}/{project-name}/{scripts_dir_name}/05_analysis.py

  5. {projects_root}/{project-name}/{docs_dir_name}/03_cleaning.yaml
  6. {projects_root}/{project-name}/{docs_dir_name}/04_examination.yaml

  Cycle focus: {cycle focus description}
  Cycle YAML for reference: {cycles/{X}.yaml full content}
  Script evidence produced this iteration: {the candidate script_evidence}
  User observations: {decision_ledger entry's user_observations from Step 2, or "none"}

  Produce this structured output, in order, with these exact section headings:

  EVALUATION: Cycle {X} - {focus}

  MISSING REQUIRED EVIDENCE (list required evidence keys or judgment outputs that are absent; evidence with a satisfied skip rule is not missing):
  - Unanswered: [list of IDs, or "none"]

  CYCLE-SPECIFIC PCS QUESTIONS (from `pcs_focus.items`, if any):
  {pcs_focus.items from the cycle YAML, one bullet per item, or "none defined"}

  DEFECT SCAN (adversarial mode):
  Assume the work contains errors. Actively falsify the acceptance criteria and material evidence rather than confirm them. Record only failures or non-obvious risks; do not write PASS notes for every criterion. Categories to scan:
  contract drift, post-hoc analysis additions, claim-boundary widening,
  protocol violations, forbidden variable usage, unauthorized data access,
  unregistered specification changes, result-quality-driven self-revision,
  perturbation or challenger added after seeing primary results, visibility
  violations, examination-support misalignment.
  If after genuinely adversarial scrutiny you find zero defects, state
  "No defects found" and name at least three specific failure modes you
  tested and ruled out. Do not fabricate defects.
  - Defect 1: [description with evidence]
  - Defect 2: [description with evidence]

  SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION:
  - Defect 1: BLOCKING | NON-BLOCKING - [one-line reason]
  - Defect 2: BLOCKING | NON-BLOCKING - [one-line reason]

  ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA ASSESSMENT (list only failed criteria or non-obvious criteria that materially affected the decision; missing required evidence fails dependent criteria):
  - {criterion_id}: PASS | FAIL - [evidence]

  CLAIM BOUNDARY CHECK:
  - Locked verbs_allowed and verbs_forbidden (from claim_boundary plus any narrowing_log_additions): [summary]
  - Any language or action in this cycle that violates them: [list, or "none"]
  - Any narrowing this cycle introduced: [list, or "none"]

  DECISION-RELEVANT COUNTERFACTUAL:
  - Strongest plausible alternative that would change a downstream decision: [alternative, affected decision, why accepted/rejected]

  CONTRACT FIDELITY (Cycles B/C/D/F only): {contract followed | drift detected | amendment needed per locked A07 policy}
  GAPS REMAINING: [list, or "none"]
  RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP CYCLE: [topic and why, or "none"]

  FINAL COUNTS:
  Unanswered items: [count]
  Blocking defects: [count]
  Failed criteria: [count]

  Be objective. Not harsh, not lenient.
  """
)
```

When both subagents return, the model parses three counts from the evaluation output: `Unanswered items`, `Blocking defects`, `Failed criteria`. `blocking_failures = unanswered + blocking_defects + failed_criteria`; `blocking_failures == 0` means PASS. Every required evidence key must be produced or formally skipped, and every acceptance criterion must pass or be explicitly overridden.

Digest subagent replies only when they change the cycle outcome or leave a risk that downstream stages must carry. Store those items in `decision_ledger[*].review_findings`.

Include only:
- blocking findings or failed criteria that drove the decision
- decision-changing external sources, referenced by `research_log#n` when a research log exists
- the strongest rejected alternative when it would change a downstream decision
- unresolved risks that downstream stages must carry

Exclude PASS notes, subagent summaries, restatements of required evidence, sources that did not change behavior, and default implementation choices.

### Step 4: Decision

When both subagents return:

1. Verify each result is non-empty and contains its required sections. If malformed, escalate to the user (interactive) or follow `the `--auto` rule in this SKILL.md` (auto).
2. Parse `Unanswered items`, `Blocking defects`, `Failed criteria` from the evaluation output.
3. Compute `blocking_failures = unanswered + blocking_defects + failed_criteria`.
4. Apply the decision matrix.

Decision matrix:

| blocking_failures | forward actions allowed |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| 0 | pass, iterate |
| > 0 | iterate, acknowledge_gap (with written justification) |

Always available regardless of `blocking_failures`:
- `iterate` -> extend the cycle's function with new checks, rerun Step 1
- `reopen_examine` -> stop and reopen `examine` (support overestimated, fragility understated)
- `reopen_protocol` -> stop and reopen `protocol` (admissible method set or visibility rules too tight or too loose)
- `reopen_formulate` -> stop and reopen `formulate` plus `protocol` (question type or claim boundary needs widening)
- `reopen_clean` -> stop and reopen `clean` (structural data problem not caught earlier)
- `data_insufficient` -> log why and present options (request more data, reformulate, archive)
- `archive` -> stop with documentation of why
- `override` -> user states the specific reason a FAIL is incorrect; logged as `override: {reason, criterion}`; forward actions unlock

Cycle A special rule: passing Cycle A additionally requires explicit user approval of the full locked contract. The decision matrix applies, but the model does not set `status.current_cycle: B` until that approval is recorded in `contract.user_approval`.

Interactive mode: present the synthesized assessment and the allowed actions via `AskUserQuestion`. Wait for the user's answer before invoking any other tool.

Auto mode: apply the autonomous decision protocol from `the `--auto` rule in this SKILL.md`.

All challengers producing materially different results from the primary is not a backtracking trigger. It is a finding documented in Cycle D for `evaluate` to adjudicate. `analyze` does not self-revise based on result quality.

### Step 5: Log

Append one entry to `decision_ledger`. Required fields:

- `cycle`, `iteration`
- `decision`, `blocking_failures`, `blocking_reason`, `evidence_summary`, `changed_fields`, and `next_action`

Write conditional fields only when they apply:

- `user_observations`: captured in Step 2 when AskUserQuestion elicited user input.
- `decision_reason`: required when `decision != pass`.
- `override`: `{reason, criterion}` only when a FAIL was overridden.

`blocking_failures` (0 = PASS, >0 = FAIL) is the enforceable integer summary. Record only material failed criteria, rejected alternatives, or source-backed decisions; do not store Per-criterion PASS notes or full subagent output.

Update every canonical-YAML field named by the cycle spec `writes`, but only for fields this project actually populates. Leave non-applicable optional fields out entirely rather than setting them to null. Cycle-specific `step4_additions` are applied at this point if the cycle YAML defines them. `pcs_focus` is consumed by the Step 3 evaluation subagent prompt and produces no separate Step 5 entry.

Set `status.current_cycle` to the next cycle letter (or keep for another iteration). Append the closed cycle letter to `status.completed_cycles` only when the cycle passes or is closed by override. The planned order is A -> B -> C -> D -> F, with any approved En follow-ups slotted before F.

Re-parse `05_analysis.yaml` to confirm validity.

## Ending the Cycle Loop

The loop ends when all of the following hold:

- every mandatory cycle (A, B, C, D, F) has a closing `decision` of `pass` or an `override`
- every approved En follow-up is resolved
- `reproducibility.status` is `pass` (produced by Cycle F)
- interactive mode: the user explicitly approves the contract (Cycle A), the deviation register, evaluation handoff, and claim boundary as-narrowed
- auto mode: the stage approval checkpoint in `the `--auto` rule in this SKILL.md` completes

Finalization requires explicit stage-close discipline.

## PCS Subagent Review

At stage close:

```text
Agent(
  model="{subagent_model}",
  description="PCS review of analyze stage",
  prompt="""
  You are a PCS reviewer for a Skeptic analyze stage.

  Read:
  1. {projects_root}/{project-name}/{docs_dir_name}/05_analysis.yaml
  2. {projects_root}/{project-name}/{scripts_dir_name}/05_analysis.py
  3. {projects_root}/{project-name}/{docs_dir_name}/01_formulation.yaml
  4. {projects_root}/{project-name}/{docs_dir_name}/02_protocol.yaml
  5. {projects_root}/{project-name}/{docs_dir_name}/03_cleaning.yaml
  6. {projects_root}/{project-name}/{docs_dir_name}/04_examination.yaml

  Evaluate only the incremental risk introduced by analysis contract lock
  and execution. Do not restate the full formulation, protocol, cleaning,
  or examination reviews.

  PREDICTABILITY:
  - Did execution produce outputs that the protocol-specified reality check
    in `evaluate` can run against?
  - Are primary and sensitivity outputs structured for comparison?
  - Are target population or deployment-context mismatches surfaced as flags?

  STABILITY:
  - Are perturbation and challenger outputs present and separated so
    `evaluate` can assess whether results survive reasonable alternatives?
  - Were perturbation axes adequate for the route?
  - Could a different but still reasonable locked contract materially change
    the allowed claim?

  COMPUTABILITY:
  - Can another analyst reproduce the full analysis from the locked contract,
    cleaned artifacts, frozen artifacts, and the analyze script?
  - Did the reproducibility re-run pass?
  - Are random seeds, parameters, and diagnostics recorded?

  CONTRACT FIDELITY:
  - Did execution follow the locked contract?
  - Are deviations and amendments documented with cause, impact, and
    narrowing confirmation?

  MAIN RISK DRIVER:
  - What single contract choice or execution choice introduced the most risk,
    if any?

  REOPEN CYCLE OR ROUTE UPSTREAM:
  - Should `analyze` reopen a cycle or route upstream? Yes or no, and why.

  For each lens, state what holds up well, what is uncertain or risky, and
  any specific recommendations. Keep it concise.

Digest the review into `pcs_review`: record `overall`, `blocking_findings`, `material_risks`, `material_findings`, `disposition`, and `disposition_reason`. Do not store the full review text unless a FAIL or override makes literal audit text necessary; if retained, store only a pointer in `full_review_pointer`.

- Interactive mode: present via `AskUserQuestion` with options `satisfied`, `valid_concern`, `disagree_override`. Wait for the user's answer before invoking any other tool.
- Auto mode: apply `the `--auto` rule in this SKILL.md` stage-close rules.

Record the chosen disposition and reason in `pcs_review.disposition` and `pcs_review.disposition_reason`.

The subagent advises. It does not silently widen scope, bypass a blocking concern, or revise analysis outputs based on result quality.

## Finalization

After the PCS review clears or the user overrides it:

1. Finalize `claim_boundary`: ensure the analyze-stage `narrowing_log_additions` are ordered by the cycle that introduced them (A, B, D, or F), that no entry widens `scope`, `evidence_ceiling`, `generalization_limit`, or the effective verb set, and that any added `verbs_forbidden_added` or `verbs_allowed_added` are explicit.

2. Finalize `evaluation_handoff`: confirm `claim_inventory`, `contract_summary`, `execution_summary`, `deviation_register`, `contract_amendments`, `flags_for_evaluate`, and `handoff_discipline` are populated and that every protocol-committed analysis from `02_protocol.yaml` is either completed in `primary_execution` / `sensitivity_execution` / `challenger_execution` or logged under `deviations` with justification. `claim_inventory` is the compact pre-adjudication table for `evaluate`: one row per claim the analysis contract was designed to support, with `claim_id`, claim statement, quantity, evidence keys, stability inputs, known limits, allowed verbs, and forbidden verbs.

3. Parse `05_analysis.yaml` with a standard YAML loader. Repair if parsing fails.

4. Render `05_analysis.md` from the canonical YAML. Keep the report compact: one `##` section per top-level YAML key that is populated (`Upstream Contract`, `Locked Analysis Contract`, `Assumption Verification`, `Primary Execution`, `Sensitivity Execution`, `Challenger Execution`, `Comparison Table`, `Deviation Register`, `Contract Amendments`, `Claim Boundary As-Narrowed`, `Reproducibility`, `Evaluation Handoff`, `PCS Assessment`). Omit sections whose YAML keys are empty or absent. Reference compact `pcs_review` fields through the YAML; the markdown is a rendered summary.

5. Update `README.md` with:

   ```markdown
   ## Analyze [COMPLETE]
   Type: {question_type}
   Active route: {route}
   Method: {method_family} -- {primary_specification one-line}
   Contract amendments: {n, or "none"}
   Deviations: {n, or "none"}
   Claim boundary: {unchanged from examine | narrowed to {one-line}}
   Perturbation axes: {n} executed
   Challengers: {n} executed
   Reproducibility: pass -- {runtime}
   Next: Evaluate - route-appropriate PCS review of outputs and claims
   ```

6. Set `status.locked_at: {ISO timestamp}`. Re-parse the YAML to confirm validity.

7. Read `README.md` and include the `## Analyze [COMPLETE]` block exactly in the stage-close user message. If the block is not present or any field is empty, finalization is incomplete; return to step 5. Only then tell the user the analyze stage is complete.

## Backtracking

If a downstream stage reopens `analyze`, or an in-stage decision triggers a reopen of an upstream stage:

- Preserve every entry in `decision_ledger`. Append new iterations.
- Unlock the stage: set `status.locked_at: null`.
- When reopening upstream (`reopen_examine`, `reopen_protocol`, `reopen_formulate`, `reopen_clean`): record the reason in the current cycle's `decision_reason`, write the target stage and rationale, and stop. Do not silently rewind. The upstream stage reopens under its own backtracking discipline.
- Re-run the affected cycles and re-render the markdown at the end.
- `claim_boundary.narrowing_log_additions` already written remain in place; only widening is prohibited.
- Contract amendments under the locked `contract.assumption_failure_policy` remain permitted only inside Cycle B. Post-result amendments require an explicit reopen of Cycle A with user approval.
