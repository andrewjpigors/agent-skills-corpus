description: Run the review phase — adversarial review of implementation against the approved spec, plan, and verification evidence.

Before anything else happens here: read your phase checklist. It's at .wazir/runs/latest/phases/. Every item on it is there because skipping it caused problems before. Are you going to follow it or skip it?

# Reviewer

## Session Boundary (Hard Gate — `final` mode only)

When invoked with `--mode final`, the completion phase MUST start in a fresh session. Do NOT run final review in a session that executed subtasks — the orchestrator's execution context biases the reviewer (it participated in routing decisions, saw intermediate findings, accumulated context that masks drift). If this skill is invoked in `final` mode in a session that ran the executor phase, STOP and instruct the user to start a new session with the execute-to-complete handover artifact.

This gate does NOT apply to other review modes (task-review, spec-challenge, plan-review, etc.) — those run within their respective phase sessions.

## Model Annotation
When multi-model mode is enabled:
- **Sonnet** for internal review passes (internal-review)
- **Opus** for final review mode (final-review)
- **Opus** for spec-challenge mode (spec-harden)
- **Opus** for architectural-design-review mode (design)
- **Opus** for visual-design-review mode (visual design)

## Command Routing
Follow the Canonical Command Matrix in `hooks/routing-matrix.json`.
- Large commands (test runners, builds, diffs, dependency trees, linting) → context-mode tools
- Small commands (git status, ls, pwd, wazir CLI) → native Bash
- If context-mode unavailable, fall back to native Bash with warning

## Codebase Exploration
1. Query `wazir index search-symbols <query>` first
2. Use `wazir recall file <path> --tier L1` for targeted reads
3. Fall back to direct file reads ONLY for files identified by index queries
4. Maximum 10 direct file reads without a justifying index query
5. If no index exists: `wazir index build && wazir index summarize --tier all`

Run the Final Review phase — or any review mode invoked by other phases.

The reviewer role owns all review loops across the pipeline: research-review, clarification-review, spec-challenge, architectural-design-review, visual-design-review, plan-review, per-task execution review, and final review. Each uses phase-specific dimensions from `docs/reference/review-loop-pattern.md`.

**Key principle for `final` mode:** Compare implementation against the **ORIGINAL INPUT** (briefing + input files), NOT the task specs. The executor's per-task reviewer already validated against task specs — that concern is covered. The final reviewer catches drift: does what we built match what the user actually asked for?

**Reviewer-owned responsibilities** (callers must NOT replicate these):
1. **Two-tier review** — internal review first (fast, cheap, expertise-loaded), Codex second (fresh eyes on clean code)
2. **Dimension selection** — the reviewer selects the correct dimension set for the review mode and depth
3. **Pass counting** — the reviewer tracks pass numbers and enforces the depth-based cap (quick=3, standard=5, deep=7). Final mode uses a different structure: 2+1 passes (see Completion Pipeline section).
4. **Finding attribution** — each finding is tagged `[Internal]`, `[Codex]`, or `[Both]` based on source
5. **Dimension set recording** — each review pass file records which canonical dimension set was used, enabling Phase Scoring (first vs final delta)
6. **Learning pipeline** — ALL findings (internal + Codex) feed into `state.sqlite` and the learning system

## Review Modes

The reviewer operates in different modes depending on the phase. Mode MUST be passed explicitly by the caller (`--mode <mode>`). The reviewer does NOT auto-detect mode from artifact availability. If `--mode` is not provided, ask the user which review to run.

| Mode | Invoked during | Prerequisites | Dimensions | Output |
|------|---------------|---------------|------------|--------|
| `final` | After integration verification + concern resolution | All completion inputs (see Completion Pipeline section) | 7 final-review dims, 2+1 passes, scored 0-70 | Scored verdict with severity-based exit criteria (SHIP/SHIP WITH CAVEATS/DO NOT SHIP) |
| `spec-challenge` | After specify | Draft spec artifact, original input | 5 spec/clarification dims | Pass/fix loop, no score |
| `architectural-design-review` | After architectural design approval (Phase 5) | Design artifact, approved spec, original input | 6 architectural design-review dims | Pass/fix loop, no score |
| `visual-design-review` | After visual design approval (Phase 4a) | Visual design artifact, approved spec, original input | 5 visual design-review dims | Pass/fix loop, no score |
| `plan-review` | After planning | Draft plan artifact, original input | 8 plan dims (7 + input coverage) | Pass/fix loop, no score |
| `task-review` | During execution, per task | Uncommitted changes or `--base` SHA, original input | 5 task-execution dims (correctness, tests, wiring, drift, quality) | Pass/fix loop, no score |
| `research-review` | During discover | Research artifact, original input | 5 research dims | Pass/fix loop, no score |
| `clarification-review` | During clarify | Clarification artifact, original input | 5 spec/clarification dims | Pass/fix loop, no score |

Each mode follows the review loop pattern in `docs/reference/review-loop-pattern.md`. Pass counts are fixed by depth (quick=3, standard=5, deep=7). No extension.

### CHANGELOG Enforcement

In `task-review` and `final` modes, flag missing CHANGELOG entries for user-facing changes as **[warning]** severity. User-facing changes include new features, behavior changes, and bug fixes visible to users. Internal changes (refactors, tooling, tests) do not require CHANGELOG entries.

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites depend on the review mode:

### `final` mode

**Phase Prerequisites (Hard Gate):** Before proceeding, verify ALL of these artifacts exist. If ANY is missing, **STOP** and report which are missing.

- [ ] `.wazir/runs/latest/clarified/clarification.md`
- [ ] `.wazir/runs/latest/clarified/spec-hardened.md`
- [ ] `.wazir/runs/latest/clarified/design.md`
- [ ] `.wazir/runs/latest/clarified/execution-plan.md`
- [ ] `.wazir/runs/latest/artifacts/verification-proof.md`

If any file is missing:

> **Cannot run final review: missing prerequisite artifacts.**
>
> Missing: [list missing files]
>
> Run `/wazir:clarifier` (for clarified/* files) or `/wazir:executor` (for verification-proof.md) first.

1. Check `.wazir/runs/latest/artifacts/` has completed task artifacts. If not, tell the user to run `/wazir:executor` first.
2. Read the approved spec, plan, and design from `.wazir/runs/latest/clarified/`.
3. Read `depth` from `run-config.yaml`. Read `.wazir/state/config.json` for `multi_tool` settings.

### `task-review` mode
1. Uncommitted changes exist for the current task, or a `--base` SHA is provided for committed changes.
2. Read `depth` from `run-config.yaml`. Read `.wazir/state/config.json` for `multi_tool` settings.
3. **Commit discipline check:** If uncommitted changes span work from multiple tasks (e.g., files from task N and task N+1 are both modified), REJECT immediately: "REJECTED: Multiple tasks in single commit. Split into per-task commits before review." This is a blocking finding — no other dimensions are evaluated until resolved.
4. **Security sensitivity check:** Run `detectSecurityPatterns` from `tooling/src/checks/security-sensitivity.js` against the diff. If `triggered === true`, add the 6 security review dimensions (injection, auth bypass, data exposure, CSRF/SSRF, XSS, secrets leakage) to the standard 5 task-execution dimensions for this review pass. Security findings use severity levels: critical (exploitable), high (likely exploitable), medium (defense-in-depth gap), low (best-practice deviation).
5. **Pipeline vs standalone:** In-pipeline execution, `task-review` is handled by the subtask execution loop's Reviewer/Verifier steps — the orchestrator dispatches the loop, not this skill. This skill's `task-review` mode is for standalone/non-pipeline invocations only (e.g., manual review of uncommitted changes outside a pipeline run). See `docs/reference/review-loop-pattern.md` "Subtask Execution Loop" section.

### `spec-challenge`, `architectural-design-review`, `visual-design-review`, `plan-review`, `research-review`, `clarification-review` modes
1. The appropriate input artifact for the mode exists.
2. Read the original user input from `.wazir/input/briefing.md` and any `input/*.md` files. This is required for ALL review modes — it serves as the ground truth reference per Vision Principle 16.
3. Read `depth` from `run-config.yaml`. Read `.wazir/state/config.json` for `multi_tool` settings.
4. **`plan-review` additional dimension — Input Coverage:**
   - Read the original input/briefing from `.wazir/input/briefing.md` and any `input/*.md` files
   - List every distinct item/requirement in the original input
   - For each input item, check whether at least one task maps to it
   - If any input item has no mapped task → **HIGH** finding: "Input item '[item]' has no mapped task in the plan"
   - One task MAY cover multiple input items (vertical-slice) if justified in the task description
   - This is item-level traceability, not a count comparison — aligns with the scope coverage hard gate

## Review Process (`final` mode) — Completion Pipeline

**The final review is not another code review — it is a compliance audit with fix authority.**

The completion pipeline runs three stages. The orchestrator (wazir skill) dispatches Stages 1-2 as separate sub-phases (4a, 4b) before invoking this skill. The reviewer skill owns Stage 3 (the review passes). Stages 1-2 are documented here for context — the reviewer consumes their outputs but does not orchestrate them.

### Integration Verification (Vision Stage 1 — orchestrator-owned, sub-phase 4a)

The orchestrator runs the full verification suite on merged main before invoking the reviewer:

1. **Plan-defined integration criteria**: run the exact commands specified in `.wazir/runs/latest/clarified/execution-plan.md` under "Integration verification criteria"
2. **Standard suite**: test suite, type checking, lint, build, and full deterministic analysis scan
3. **Side effects verification**: check all declared external side effects from subtask specs were completed or compensated. Undeclared side effects discovered here are CRITICAL findings.

If integration fails: identify the culprit via sequential merge record (re-run checks after each individual merge). Targeted fix executor receives failing output + acceptance criteria + merged code.

Save results to `.wazir/runs/latest/completion/integration/`.

### Concern Resolution (Vision Stage 2 — orchestrator-owned, sub-phase 4b)

A fresh agent — one that did NOT produce any of the artifacts being evaluated — reads:

1. **Concern registry**: all DONE_WITH_CONCERNS entries from execution
2. **Residuals**: all `residuals-<subtask-id>.md` files from execution (findings that exhausted the 7-spawn subtask loop)
3. **Batch-boundary disposition**: concerns from final batch + cross-subtask systemic patterns

For each concern and residual, four questions:
1. Is the concern still valid? (Some become moot after later subtasks.)
2. Was the resolution acceptable? (Full implementation may change the picture.)
3. Does it map to a spec requirement? (If yes, cannot be dismissed as trade-off.)
4. Is it systemic? (3+ occurrences across subtasks = planning gap.)

**Principle: concerns are innocent until proven acceptable.** Burden of proof is on the resolution.

**Sycophancy guard**: the generating agent MUST NOT rebut or respond to reviewer concerns during this stage. Models abandon correct answers 98% of the time when challenged. If a concern is contested, route to human — not to agent debate.

Save results to `.wazir/runs/latest/completion/concerns/`.

### Final Review — 2+1 Passes (Vision Stages 3-6)

**Before starting, output to the user:**

> **Final Review** — About to run 2+1 pass compliance audit comparing your implementation against the original input. Pass 1: expertise-loaded internal review. Pass 2: cross-model fresh-context review. Pass 3 (conditional): reconciliation if passes disagree.
>
> **Why this matters:** Without this, implementation drift ships undetected. Per-task review confirms each task matches its spec, but cannot catch: tasks that collectively miss the original intent, scope creep, or acceptance criteria rewritten to match implementation.

#### Pass 1: Internal Review (Expertise-Loaded)

Composer-built prompt with `always.reviewer` + `reviewer_modes.final` + stack antipatterns + auto modules.

**Input:** All completion inputs — merged implementation, approved plan, approved spec, original user input, concern resolution output, all `proof.json` files, integration results, all `analysis-findings.json` files.

**Dual comparison:**
1. **Implementation vs Plan** (bidirectional): does each plan item have implementation? Are there files the plan didn't mention? Plan items with no code? Code no plan item requested?
2. **Implementation vs Original Input**: the telephone game check. Would the user recognize this as what they asked for? Drift measured from the source across all transformations.

**Three additional dimensions:**
3. **Concern & residual resolutions**: re-examine every resolution from Stage 2
4. **Verification evidence quality**: are tests meaningful or tautological? Every acceptance criterion covered by proof?
5. **Integration completeness**: do cross-subtask interfaces match? Data flow correct between modules?

Score each of the 7 canonical dimensions 0-10. Total out of 70. Additionally classify each finding by severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW).

Save to `.wazir/runs/latest/completion/final-review/pass-1-internal.md`.

#### Finding Severity (Final Review Specific)

| Severity | Meaning | Response |
|----------|---------|----------|
| CRITICAL | Implementation contradicts spec or original input | Targeted fix or escalate to user |
| HIGH | Significant drift or integration gap | Targeted fix |
| MEDIUM | Minor drift or quality gap | Document, fix if ≤10 lines |
| LOW | Style or convention divergence | Document for learning only |

#### Targeted Fixes (Between Passes 1 and 2)

- **CRITICAL/HIGH code issues** → fix executor batched by severity tier. All CRITICAL findings to one executor, all HIGH to another. Each executor receives all findings of its tier + relevant files + violated criteria. Batching prevents the "Death of a Thousand Round Trips" anti-pattern.
- **CRITICAL/HIGH drift** → escalate to user (pipeline can't decide user intent)
- **MEDIUM** → fix if ≤10 lines, otherwise document
- **LOW** → document only (regression risk exceeds value)

After fixes: commit, re-run integration verification (Stage 1). Fixed state becomes input for Pass 2.

**Finding adoption tracking**: after targeted fixes, record which findings led to code changes vs documented vs ignored. Write to `.wazir/runs/latest/completion/final-review/finding-adoption.md`. This is the learner's source data for adoption rate metrics.

#### Pass 2: Cross-Model Review (Fresh Session, Different Family)

Different model family from Pass 1. Selection priority:
1. Different vendor, highest tier (maximizes blind spot diversity)
2. Same vendor, different generation
3. Same vendor, same tier (last resort — still a fresh context)

**Input:** Deterministic inputs + concern resolution output — merged implementation, plan, spec, original input, `proof.json` files, integration results, `analysis-findings.json` files, concern resolution output. Pass 2 does NOT receive Pass 1's LLM-generated findings. Deterministic findings reduce hallucinations 60-80%. Prior LLM opinions cause self-conditioning. Note: concern resolution output is included despite being LLM-generated because it is a neutral evaluation by a fresh agent (not the producer's self-assessment) — the vision explicitly includes it in Pass 2's inputs.

Independent review. Same dual comparison (implementation vs plan vs original input). Also reviews concern resolutions and verification evidence independently.

If Codex/Gemini CLI is the cross-model tool: invoked via Bash in a fresh subagent session. Falls back to same-model fresh-context review if external tools unavailable.

Save to `.wazir/runs/latest/completion/final-review/pass-2-cross-model.md`.

#### Pass 3: Reconciliation (Conditional)

Runs ONLY if Passes 1 and 2 have conflicting CRITICAL or HIGH findings — one pass flagged an issue the other did not, or they disagree on severity/resolution.

A fresh agent reads both pass outputs and reconciles:
- **Both found it** → confirmed finding
- **Only one found it** → evaluate with code evidence. If substantiated, confirmed. If not, downgrade or remove.
- **Conflicting assessments** → escalate to user with both rationales

If Passes 1 and 2 agree (no conflicting CRITICAL/HIGH): skip Pass 3, merge findings with deduplication.

Save to `.wazir/runs/latest/completion/final-review/pass-3-reconciliation.md` (if run).

### Scoring and Exit Criteria

Score each dimension 0-10. Total out of 70.

| Verdict | Score | Action |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **PASS** | 56+ | Ready for SHIP sign-off |
| **NEEDS MINOR FIXES** | 42-55 | Auto-fix and re-review |
| **NEEDS REWORK** | 28-41 | Re-run affected tasks |
| **FAIL** | 0-27 | Fundamental issues |

**Verdict-to-sign-off mapping:** Score verdicts determine the *next action*. Sign-off labels (SHIP/SHIP WITH CAVEATS/DO NOT SHIP) are the *final disposition* after all actions complete. PASS with no remaining findings → SHIP. PASS with accepted MEDIUM/LOW → SHIP WITH CAVEATS. NEEDS REWORK or FAIL after all passes exhausted → DO NOT SHIP.

**Precedence rule**: a single unresolved CRITICAL finding prevents SHIP regardless of score. When score and blocking findings disagree, blocking findings win.

Full exit criteria:
- All CRITICAL findings resolved (including CRITICAL residuals from execution)
- All HIGH findings resolved or explicitly accepted by user
- MEDIUM/LOW documented in learning system
- Every spec requirement has implementation evidence
- No undetected drift (or drift explicitly approved)
- Cross-model reviewer has no unresolved CRITICAL/HIGH

If not met after Pass 3 (or Pass 2 when Pass 3 skipped): escalate to user with full finding history.

## Two-Tier Review Flow (Non-Final Modes)

The review process for non-final modes has two tiers. Internal review catches ~80% of issues quickly and cheaply. Codex review provides fresh eyes on clean code.

**Note:** Final mode uses the Completion Pipeline structure above (2+1 passes), not this two-tier flow. The two-tier flow applies to: task-review, spec-challenge, architectural-design-review, visual-design-review, plan-review, research-review, and clarification-review modes.

### Tier 1: Internal Review (Fast, Cheap, Expertise-Loaded)

1. **Compose expertise:** Load relevant expertise modules from `expertise/composition-map.yaml` into context based on the review mode and detected stack. This gives the internal reviewer domain-specific knowledge.
2. **Run internal review** using the dimension set for the current mode. When multi-model is enabled, use **Sonnet** (not Opus) for internal review passes — it's fast and good enough for pattern matching against expertise.
3. **Produce findings:** Each finding is tagged `[Internal]` with severity (blocking, warning, note).
4. **Fix cycle:** If blocking findings exist, the executor fixes them. Re-run internal review. Repeat until clean or cap reached.

Internal review passes are logged to `.wazir/runs/latest/reviews/<mode>-internal-pass-<N>.md`.

### Tier 2: External Review (Fresh Eyes on Clean Code)

Codex is one implementation of cross-model review. If `gemini` or other tools are in `multi_tool.tools`, follow the same pattern. The principle is "different model family for blind spot diversity," not a specific vendor.

Only runs AFTER Tier 1 produces a clean pass (no blocking findings).

Read `.wazir/state/config.json`. If `multi_tool.tools` includes external reviewers:

#### Codex Review

**For detailed Codex CLI usage, see `wz:codex-cli` skill.**

If `codex` is in `multi_tool.tools`:

1. Run Codex review against the current changes:
   ```bash
   CODEX_MODEL=$(jq -r '.multi_tool.codex.model // empty' .wazir/state/config.json 2>/dev/null)
   CODEX_MODEL=${CODEX_MODEL:-gpt-5.4}
   codex review -c model="$CODEX_MODEL" --uncommitted --title "Wazir review: <brief summary>" \
     "Review against these acceptance criteria: <paste criteria from spec>" \
     2>&1 | tee .wazir/runs/latest/reviews/codex-review.md
   ```
   Or if changes are committed:
   ```bash
   CODEX_MODEL=$(jq -r '.multi_tool.codex.model // empty' .wazir/state/config.json 2>/dev/null)
   CODEX_MODEL=${CODEX_MODEL:-gpt-5.4}
   codex review -c model="$CODEX_MODEL" --base <base-branch> --title "Wazir review: <brief summary>" \
     "Review against these acceptance criteria: <paste criteria from spec>" \
     2>&1 | tee .wazir/runs/latest/reviews/codex-review.md
   ```

2. **Extract findings only** (context protection): After tee, use `execute_file` to extract only the final findings from the Codex output (everything after the last `codex` marker). If context-mode is unavailable, use `tac <file> | sed '/^codex$/q' | tac | tail -n +2`. If no marker found, fail closed (0 findings, warn user). See `docs/reference/review-loop-pattern.md` "Codex Output Context Protection" for full protocol.
3. Incorporate extracted Codex findings into your scoring — if Codex flags something you missed, add it. If you disagree with a Codex finding, note it with your rationale.

**Codex error handling:** If codex exits non-zero (auth/rate-limit/transport failure), log the full stderr, mark the pass as `codex-unavailable` in the review log, and use internal review findings only for that pass. Do NOT treat a Codex failure as a clean review. Do NOT skip the pass. The next pass still attempts Codex (transient failures may recover).

**Code review scoping by mode:**
- Use `--uncommitted` when reviewing uncommitted changes (`task-review` mode).
- Use `--base <sha>` when reviewing committed changes.
- Use `codex exec -c model="$CODEX_MODEL"` with stdin pipe for non-code artifacts (`spec-challenge`, `architectural-design-review`, `visual-design-review`, `plan-review`, `research-review`, `clarification-review` modes).
- See `docs/reference/review-loop-pattern.md` for code review scoping rules.

#### Gemini Review

Look at your recent actions. Did each one follow from a checklist item, or are you improvising? Improvisation means drift. Go back to .wazir/runs/latest/phases/ and realign. Where did you go off-script?
If `gemini` is in `multi_tool.tools`, follow the same pattern using the Gemini CLI when available. **For detailed Gemini CLI usage, see `wz:gemini-cli` skill.**

### Fix Cycle (Codex Findings)

If Codex produces blocking findings:
1. Executor fixes the Codex findings
2. Re-run internal review (quick pass) to verify fixes didn't introduce regressions
3. Optionally re-run Codex for a clean pass

### Merging Findings

The final review report must clearly attribute each finding:
- `[Internal]` — found by Tier 1 internal review
- `[Codex]` — found by Tier 2 Codex review
- `[Gemini]` — found by Tier 2 Gemini review
- `[Both]` — found independently by multiple sources

### Finding Persistence (Learning Pipeline)

ALL findings from both tiers are persisted to `state.sqlite` for cross-run learning:

```javascript
// After each review pass
const { insertFinding, getRecurringFindingHashes } = require('tooling/src/state/db');
const db = openStateDb(stateRoot);

for (const finding of allFindings) {
  insertFinding(db, {
    run_id: runId,
    phase: reviewMode,
    source: finding.attribution, // 'internal', 'codex', 'gemini'
    severity: finding.severity,
    description: finding.description,
    finding_hash: hashFinding(finding.description),
  });
}

// Check for recurring patterns
const recurring = getRecurringFindingHashes(db, 2);
// Recurring findings → auto-propose as learnings in the learn phase
```

This is how Wazir evolves — findings that recur across runs become accepted learnings injected into future executor context, preventing the same mistakes.

## Interaction Mode Awareness

Read `interaction_mode` from run-config:

- **`auto`:** No user checkpoints. Present verdict and let gating agent decide. On escalation, write reason and STOP.
- **`guided`:** Standard behavior — present verdict, ask user how to proceed.
- **`interactive`:** Discuss findings with user: "I found a potential auth bypass in `src/auth.js:42` — here's why I rated it high severity. Do you agree, or is there context I'm missing?" Show detailed reasoning for each dimension score.

**Exception for `final` mode:** In final mode, completion is autonomous regardless of `interaction_mode`. The only user interaction is the two exceptions defined in "User Interaction During Completion" (drift escalation, unresolvable concern). The mode rules above apply to non-final review modes only.

## CLI/Context-Mode Enforcement

In ALL review modes, check for these violations:

1. **Index usage enforcement:** If the agent performed >5 direct file reads (Read tool) without a preceding `wazir index search-symbols` query, flag as **[warning]** finding: "Agent performed [N] direct file reads without using wazir index. Use `wazir index search-symbols <query>` before reading files to reduce context consumption."

2. **Context-mode enforcement:** If the agent ran a large-category command (test runners, builds, diffs, dependency trees, linting — as classified by `hooks/routing-matrix.json`) using native Bash instead of context-mode tools (when context-mode is available), flag as **[warning]** finding: "Large command `[cmd]` run without context-mode. Route through `mcp__plugin_context-mode_context-mode__execute` to reduce context usage."

These are warnings, not blocking findings — they improve efficiency but don't affect correctness.

## Task-Review Log Filenames

In `task-review` mode, use task-scoped log filenames and cap tracking:
- Log filenames: `.wazir/runs/latest/reviews/execute-task-<NNN>-review-pass-<N>.md`
- Cap tracking: `wazir capture loop-check --task-id <NNN>` (each task has its own independent cap counter)

## Output

Save review results to `.wazir/runs/latest/reviews/review.md` (non-final modes) or `.wazir/runs/latest/completion/final-review/` (final mode) with:
- Findings with severity: blocking/warning/note (non-final modes) or CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW (final mode)
- Rationale tied to evidence
- Score breakdown
- Verdict

Run the phase report and display it to the user:
```bash
wazir report phase --run <run-id> --phase <review-mode>
```

Invoke `wz:humanize` on the report content (domain: technical-docs) before presenting to the user. Fix any high/medium findings — review reports are the primary artifact users read to judge pipeline quality.

Output the report content to the user in the conversation.

## Phase Report Generation

After completing any review pass, generate a phase report following `schemas/phase-report.schema.json`:

1. **`attempted_actions`** — Populate from the review findings. Each finding becomes an action entry:
   - `description`: the finding summary
   - `outcome`: `"success"` if the finding passed, `"fail"` if it is a blocking issue, `"uncertain"` if ambiguous
   - `evidence`: the rationale or evidence supporting the outcome

2. **`drift_analysis`** — Compare review findings against the approved spec:
   - `delta`: count of deviations between implementation and spec (0 = no drift)
   - `description`: summary of any drift detected and its impact

3. **`quality_metrics`** — Populate from test, lint, and type-check results gathered during review:
   - `test_pass_count`, `test_fail_count`: from test runner output
   - `lint_errors`: from linter output
   - `type_errors`: from type checker output

4. **`risk_flags`** — Populate from any high-severity findings:
   - `severity`: `"low"`, `"medium"`, or `"high"`
   - `description`: what the risk is
   - `mitigation`: recommended mitigation (if known)

5. **`decisions`** — Populate from any scope or approach decisions made during the review:
   - `description`: what was decided
   - `rationale`: why
   - `alternatives_considered`: other options evaluated (optional)
   - `source`: `"[Wazir]"`, `"[Codex]"`, or `"[Both]"` (optional)

6. **`verdict_recommendation`** — Set based on the gating rules in `config/gating-rules.yaml`:
   - `verdict`: `"continue"` (PASS), `"loop_back"` (NEEDS MINOR FIXES / NEEDS REWORK), or `"escalate"` (FAIL with fundamental issues)
   - `reasoning`: brief explanation of why this verdict was chosen

### Report Output Paths

Save reports to two formats under the run directory:
- `.wazir/runs/<id>/reports/phase-<name>-report.json` — machine-readable, validated against `schemas/phase-report.schema.json`
- `.wazir/runs/<id>/reports/phase-<name>-report.md` — human-readable Markdown summary

The gating agent (`tooling/src/gating/agent.js`) consumes the JSON report to decide: **continue**, **loop_back**, or **escalate**.

### Report Fields Reference

All required fields per `schemas/phase-report.schema.json`:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `phase_name` | string | yes | Review mode name (e.g., `"final"`, `"task-review"`) |
| `run_id` | string | yes | Current run identifier |
| `timestamp` | string (date-time) | yes | ISO 8601 timestamp of report generation |
| `attempted_actions` | array | yes | Findings mapped to action outcomes |
| `drift_analysis` | object | yes | Spec-vs-implementation drift summary |
| `quality_metrics` | object | yes | Test/lint/type results |
| `risk_flags` | array | yes | High-severity risk items |
| `decisions` | array | yes | Scope/approach decisions made |
| `verdict_recommendation` | object | no | Gating verdict based on `config/gating-rules.yaml` |

## Post-Review: Learn (final mode only)

After the final review verdict (completion Stages 3-6 exit), extract durable learnings using the **learner role** (`roles/learner.md`). This corresponds to completion pipeline Stage 7 (Apply Learning) in `docs/vision/pipeline-complete.md`.

The learning agent receives ALL signals from the run — not just review findings. See `roles/learner.md` for the full input list including user corrections (highest-priority signal), adoption rates, and quality deltas.

### Step 1: Gather all findings

Collect review findings from ALL sources in this run:
- `.wazir/runs/<run-id>/reviews/` — all review pass logs (task-review, final review)
- Codex findings (attributed `[Codex]` or `[Both]`)
- Self-audit findings (if `run_audit` was enabled)

### Step 2: Identify learning candidates

A finding becomes a learning candidate if:
- It recurred across 2+ review passes within this run (same issue found repeatedly)
- It matches a finding from a prior run (check `memory/learnings/proposed/` and `accepted/` for similar patterns)
- It represents a class of mistake, not just a single instance (e.g., "missing error handling in async functions" vs "missing try-catch on line 42")

### Step 3: Write learning proposals

For each candidate, write a proposal to `memory/learnings/proposed/<run-id>-<NNN>.md`:

```markdown
---
artifact_type: proposed_learning
phase: learn
role: learner
run_id: <run-id>
status: proposed
sources:
  - <review-file-1>
  - <review-file-2>
approval_status: required
---

# Proposed Learning: <title>

## Scope
- **Roles:** [which roles should receive this learning — e.g., executor, reviewer]
- **Stacks:** [which tech stacks — e.g., node, react, or "all"]
- **Concerns:** [which concerns — e.g., error-handling, testing, security]

## Evidence
- [finding from review pass N: description]
- [finding from review pass M: same pattern]
- [optional: similar finding from prior run <run-id>]

## Learning
[The concrete, actionable instruction that should be injected into future executor context]

## Expected Benefit
[What this prevents in future runs]

## Confidence
- **Level:** low | medium | high
- **Basis:** [single run observation | multi-run recurrence | user correction]
```

### Step 4: Humanize

Invoke `wz:humanize` on each learning proposal (domain: technical-docs). Fix any high/medium findings. Learning proposals persist across runs and shape future execution context — AI patterns in learnings propagate into every downstream run.

### Step 5: Report

Present proposed learnings to the user:

> **Learnings proposed:** [count]
> - [title 1] (confidence: high, scope: executor/node)
> - [title 2] (confidence: medium, scope: reviewer/all)
>
> Proposals saved to `memory/learnings/proposed/`. Review and accept with `/wazir audit learnings`.

Learnings are NEVER auto-applied. They require explicit user acceptance before being injected into future runs.

## Post-Review: Prepare Next (final mode only)

After learning extraction (completion Stage 7), prepare the session handoff. This corresponds to completion pipeline Stage 8 in `docs/vision/pipeline-complete.md`. Invoke the `prepare-next` skill which handles the two output modes:

### Mode 1: Run Complete → execution-summary.md

After drafting the execution summary, invoke `wz:humanize` on it before writing to disk (domain: technical-docs). This is the final pipeline output — it must read as authored, not generated.

Produces `.wazir/runs/<run-id>/execution-summary.md` with: what was built (linked to spec requirements), verification summary, concerns and resolutions, final review findings per pass with adoption rates, residuals disposition, learning proposals, quality delta, cost/timing, SHIP/SHIP WITH CAVEATS/DO NOT SHIP recommendation.

### Mode 2: Run Incomplete → handover-batch-N.md

Produces `.wazir/runs/<run-id>/handover-batch-N.md` with: completed/in-progress/remaining subtask IDs with status and lifecycle state, accumulated concerns from DONE_WITH_CONCERNS subtasks, blocked subtasks with reasons and lifecycle state, partial learnings, environment state (active branches, worktrees), resume prompt (~500 tokens, self-contained, references files for depth).

See `skills/prepare-next/SKILL.md` for the canonical template.

### Cleanup

- Archive verbose intermediate review logs (compress to summary)
- Update `.wazir/runs/latest` symlink if creating a new run
- Do NOT mutate `input/` — it belongs to the user
- Do NOT auto-load proposed learnings into the next run

## Reasoning Output

Throughout the reviewer phase, produce reasoning at two layers:

**Conversation (Layer 1):** Before each review pass, explain what dimensions are being checked and why. After findings, explain the reasoning behind severity assignments.

**File (Layer 2):** Write `.wazir/runs/<id>/reasoning/phase-reviewer-reasoning.md` with structured entries:
- **Trigger** — what prompted the finding (e.g., "diff adds SQL query without parameterization")
- **Options considered** — severity options, fix approaches
- **Chosen** — assigned severity and recommendation
- **Reasoning** — why this severity level
- **Confidence** — high/medium/low
- **Counterfactual** — what would ship if this finding were missed

Key reviewer reasoning moments: severity assignments, PASS/FAIL decisions, dimension score justifications, and escalation decisions.

### Completion-Specific Reasoning Moments

During final mode (completion pipeline), additionally capture reasoning for:
- Concern resolution dispositions (accepted/rejected/escalated)
- Reconciliation verdicts (Pass 3 confirmed/downgraded/escalated findings)
- SHIP/DO NOT SHIP decisions
- Learning proposal priorities
- Severity assignments for CRITICAL/HIGH findings

Write completion reasoning to `.wazir/runs/<id>/reasoning/phase-completion-reasoning.md`.

## User Interaction During Completion

Completion is autonomous with exactly two exceptions:
1. **Drift escalation**: implementation doesn't match what user asked for (CRITICAL/HIGH drift finding)
2. **Unresolvable concern**: requires spec/design change (concern maps to spec requirement but resolution is unacceptable)

Pipeline pauses, presents evidence, waits. User's decision is final. All other completion stages run without user interaction.

## Done

**After completing this phase, output to the user:**

> **Final Review Phase complete (Completion Pipeline).**
>
> **Integration verification:** [PASS/FAIL] — [N] tests, [N] type errors, [N] lint errors
> **Concern resolution:** [N] concerns evaluated, [N] residuals resolved, [N] escalated
> **Final review (2+1 passes):** [N] findings — [N] CRITICAL, [N] HIGH, [N] MEDIUM, [N] LOW. Score: [score]/70.
> **Pass 3 reconciliation:** [ran/skipped] — [reason]
> **Learnings:** [N] proposed (adoption rate: [X]%, quality delta: [Y] points average)
>
> **Without this phase:** Implementation drift would ship undetected, concerns would accumulate without resolution, cross-subtask integration bugs would hide, and recurring mistakes would never get captured
>
> **Changed because of this work:** [List of findings fixed per pass, score improvement, learnings extracted]

**Autonomous sign-off** — completion does NOT ask the user what to do. Present the sign-off and proceed:

> **Sign-off:** [SHIP / SHIP WITH CAVEATS / DO NOT SHIP]
> **Handoff:** `.wazir/runs/<run-id>/execution-summary.md`

If SHIP or SHIP WITH CAVEATS: proceed to create PR automatically.
If DO NOT SHIP: present findings and stop.

User interaction occurs ONLY for the two exceptions defined in "User Interaction During Completion" above (drift escalation, unresolvable concern). All other completion stages run without user prompts.

**If the run is incomplete** (batch boundary, not all subtasks done): produce `handover-batch-N.md` and hard stop. The next batch MUST resume in a fresh session consuming the handover artifact.

Final challenge: name every checklist item you completed and what you produced for each one. If any answer is "I think I covered that" instead of "here's the output," you have more work to do. Which items are you unsure about?
