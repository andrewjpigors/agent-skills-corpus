name: rust-port
description: >-
  Packaged Rust-port harness (invoked as /harness:rust-port). Runs an autonomous, resumable loop
  that performs a FULL-FEATURE, NO-DOWNGRADE port of a source project (TypeScript/Python/etc.) to
  idiomatic Rust — no feature logic left behind. ALWAYS use for: "port <project> to Rust", "rust
  port", "rewrite in Rust", "full-parity Rust port", "port meta/Archon to Rust", AND follow-ups —
  "resume", "continue the port", "run it again", "re-run", "redo only the <unit/phase>", "based on
  the previous result", "what's left to port". Also ejectable: "install/eject the rust-port harness
  into <repo>". ALSO does port-and-MERGE: "port <X> to Rust and merge into <Y>", "merge the rust code
  into <repo>", "reconcile the port with <repo>" — ports X then integrates each verified unit into a
  destination repo Y (re-verified in Y). Runs an automated 3-model workflow (opus on gates/hard design,
  sonnet on structured work, haiku on mechanical). Drives a Ralph loop over a parity ledger: one unit
  per cycle, differential parity test, commit per cycle, hand off at budget. DONE only at 100% parity
  (+ 100% merged when a destination repo is set) — nothing left behind.

# rust-port — full-feature, no-downgrade Rust port harness  (`/harness:rust-port`)

Leader skill of the **rust-port** packaged harness (in the `harness` plugin). It ports a source
project to **idiomatic Rust with zero capability loss**: every module, behavior, error path, and
edge case in the source is inventoried, ported, and **differentially verified** against the source
before it counts as done. The guarantee is **no feature logic left behind** — enforced structurally
by a parity ledger that must reach 100%, not by good intentions.

It is **packaged + runnable + ejectable**: run in place via `/harness:rust-port`, or eject into the
target/port repo's `.claude/` (see §Eject). Built on the FlexNetOS autonomous-operation pattern:
**truth lives on disk**, every cycle commits, any restart resumes cold with zero loss.

## Execution mode — Hybrid (sub-agent + file-based), and why

Single-orchestrator with specialist sub-agents, coordinated **file-based** under `.handoff/loop/`
(durable) + return-values. Not a live team: team state dies at the self-restart boundary, and this
loop's premise is that state (the parity ledger) survives a fresh process. Per phase:

| Phase | Mode | Shape |
|-------|------|-------|
| Discover / inventory | Sub-agent | cartographer → ledger+symbol-map; architect → target design; researcher → X⟷Y reuse map; cross-repo-referencer → reference map (parallel-capable) |
| Port (per cycle) | Sub-agent, sequential | one unit → porter → build-health → parity-verifier |
| Merge (per cycle, when `dest_repo` Y set) | Sub-agent, sequential | merge-integrator → build-health(Y) → parity-verifier re-verify in Y |
| Handoff | Sub-agent | continuity-steward writes HANDOFF.md |

### Model tiering — the automated 3-model workflow (opus / sonnet / haiku)

`Agent` calls are tiered by task, NOT all-opus — but **every no-downgrade GATE runs at `opus`** and is
never tiered down. Tiering a *worker* down is safe **because the opus parity gate catches any worker
downgrade** (a sonnet porter that drops a branch is FAILed and bounced back, never shipped) — so
tiering is a cost/speed lever, never a correctness downgrade.

- **opus** (gates + hard design): `rust-port-architect`, `rust-port-parity-verifier`,
  `rust-port-merge-integrator`, `evolution-steward`, and the `rust-port-cartographer` **pre-DONE
  left-behind sweep** (the completeness gate — overridden to opus even though the agent defaults lower).
- **sonnet** (structured work): `rust-port-cartographer` (inventory), `rust-port-porter`,
  `rust-port-researcher`, `continuity-steward`.
- **haiku** (mechanical): `build-health-auditor`, `rust-port-cross-repo-referencer`.

**Escalation:** a tiered worker that hits reasoning beyond its tier (intricate concurrency, an
ambiguous reconciliation) says so and the orchestrator re-runs it at the next tier up — never guess.
Shared agents (`build-health-auditor`/`continuity-steward`/`evolution-steward`) keep their `opus`
frontmatter; this orchestrator overrides their model per-call (scope law — don't edit shared defaults).

## Agents (in the plugin's shared `harness/agents/` pool)

| Agent | Owns | Shared? |
|-------|------|---------|
| `rust-port-cartographer` | exhaustive source inventory + parity ledger + left-behind sweep | specialist |
| `rust-port-architect` | Rust target layout + idiom map + dependency equivalents | specialist |
| `rust-port-porter` | full (no-stub) idiomatic port of one unit | specialist |
| `rust-port-parity-verifier` | differential parity proof (source vs Rust, + re-verify in Y) | specialist |
| `rust-port-merge-integrator` | merge a verified unit into destination repo Y (no-downgrade) | specialist |
| `rust-port-researcher` | deep research/discovery of X **and** Y (the reuse map) | specialist |
| `rust-port-cross-repo-referencer` | cross-repo reference + blast-radius map (X⟷Y⟷substrates) | specialist |
| `build-health-auditor` | cargo build/clippy/test green gate | shared |
| `continuity-steward` | cold-start HANDOFF.md at budget | shared |
| `evolution-steward` | evaluates each run, mines lessons, upgrades the harness (runs last) | shared |

Skills: `rust-port-inventory`, `rust-port-translate`, `rust-port-parity`, `rust-port-merge`,
`cross-repo-reference`, `cross-repo-health`, `icm-memory`, `session-relay-wrap-up`, `session-relay-resume`,
`harness-loop-init`, `harness-evolution` (research reuses `code-research-map`/`-analyze` + `deep-research`).

**Persistent memory (any agent, as needed):** every agent has the **`icm-memory`** skill available to
**recall** relevant prior context before acting and **store** durable memory when it learns something
(a decision, a resolved conflict, a parity gotcha, a completed unit). It is *not* a forced step — the
lead delegates *which* agent uses it *when* at runtime (graceful no-op where ICM is absent, so the
harness stays portable). This complements the loop-boundary `session-relay-wrap-up`/`-resume` ICM
store/recall with finer, in-cycle agent memory.

## Agent runtime (the declarative execution contract)

The consolidated, per-agent runtime spec for this harness. It is the single source of truth for *how*
each agent is run (it subsumes the scattered facts — the `model: "opus"` rule, the phase/mode table
above, the retry/fail-closed rule, the self-pace cadence). **This table is the declarative contract
the `harness-agent-rs` runtime (ADR-0001) will consume to execute the harness**, so every cell is
meant to be precise and machine-translatable — model, phase, concurrency, precondition, timeout/retry,
I/O files, and gate-role are the fields a runtime needs to schedule, isolate, and gate each run. Keep
it in sync with the agent defs in `harness/agents/` and the per-row contracts they declare.

| Agent | Model | Runs-in (phase) | Concurrency | Trigger / precondition | Timeout & retry (fail-closed) | Inputs (reads) | Outputs (writes) | Gate-role |
|-------|-------|-----------------|-------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|------------------|-----------|
| `rust-port-cartographer` | sonnet · **opus** (pre-DONE sweep = gate) | P1 DISCOVER (seed); DONE gate (left-behind sweep) | parallel-capable with `rust-port-architect` at DISCOVER; sequential at the sweep | initial run or new source/scope; and once more pre-DONE | retry once; on 2nd failure → `- [!]` blocked row + continue, never fake coverage; empty symbol harvest of non-empty source → `NEEDS-HUMAN` | source root; prior `parity-ledger.md`/`symbol-map.md` | `parity-ledger.md` + `symbol-map.md` (authoritative), `reports/inventory.md` | **completeness critic** — its two-grain sweep (zero unlisted units/symbols, zero `- [ ]`/`- [~]`, zero rollup violations) is a hard DONE precondition |
| `rust-port-architect` | opus | P1 DISCOVER (layout); P2 ITERATE (**mandatory** for `extend-Y` / structural-or-landing-decision / `- [!]`-blocked / above-threshold units; optional below threshold) | parallel-capable with cartographer at DISCOVER; on-demand, single-flight per unit otherwise | DISCOVER, or an `extend-Y`/structural/blocked/above-threshold unit (records `findings/<unit>-architecture.md` = design + sub-cycle decomposition the porter executes one-per-cycle) | retry once; unresolved equivalent → record options + surface to orchestrator, never pick/drop silently | source root; `parity-ledger.md` | `target-architecture.md` (layout + idiom map + dep table + port-and-map decisions); per-unit `findings/<unit>-architecture.md` (design + sub-cycle decomposition) | advisory — establishes the no-downgrade idiom/dep + reimplement-vs-map-onto mapping + per-unit decomposition the porter must follow; not a pass/fail gate |
| `rust-port-porter` | sonnet (escalate hard units → opus) | P2 ITERATE (the per-cycle worker) | **sequential, exactly one per cycle** (the one-specialist-per-cycle rule) | a picked unit whose `deps:` are all `- [x]` | retry once; if not finished → unit `- [~]`/`- [!]` + the specific `symbol-map.md` rows `- [ ]`/`- [!]`, never `- [x]` | unit's ledger + symbol rows; `target-architecture.md`; source file; `rust-port-translate` | Rust source + tests in the target crate; unit + symbol rows → `- [~]` | produces the artifact under test; its claim is **never self-certified** (verifier + auditor gate it) |
| `build-health-auditor` | haiku (per-call override; shared frontmatter stays opus) | P1 DISCOVER (skeleton baseline); P2 ITERATE (post-port compile gate); MERGE (Y green) | sequential, after the porter in a cycle | a freshly ported unit, or the DISCOVER baseline / verify-on-resume | retry once; environmental failure (toolchain/network) → `skip` w/ reason, never silent pass | target repo set; the porter's new code; (merge) Y + Y's test suite | `findings/health.md`; `baseline.md`; (merge) `findings/y-regression.md` (Y baseline captured at DISCOVER) | **green-build gate** — `cargo build` + `clippy -D warnings` (+ `test`) must pass; precondition for the parity gate; captures Y's regression baseline for the dual gate |
| `rust-port-parity-verifier` | opus | P2 ITERATE (the per-cycle gate) | sequential, after build-health-auditor | a unit that compiles + passes clippy | retry once; can't run one side → `INCONCLUSIVE`, unit stays open (never pass on faith) | unit's ledger + symbol rows; source unit; Rust impl; `target-architecture.md` | `findings/parity.md` (verdict + diff); per-symbol `- [x]` in `symbol-map.md`; golden fixtures | **the no-downgrade gate** — only a `PASS` (every contract branch matches **and** all the unit's symbols `- [x]`/`- [≠]`) lets the orchestrator mark `- [x]` |
| `rust-port-merge-integrator` | opus | MERGE (per cycle, when `dest_repo` Y set) | sequential, in the Y worktree (`dest_worktree`/`dest_branch`); one per cycle | a verified/`reuse-Y`/`map-onto` unit + a `dest_repo` Y | retry once; unresolvable conflict / substrate can't express a behavior → `- [!]`/`- [≠]` + route up, never drop a side; any gate fail → `reset --hard` + release locks + `- [~]` (atomic) | ported Rust (if any); `merge-ledger.md`; `reports/{research,cross-repo-refs}.md`; Y worktree | merged Rust on `dest_branch`; `merge-ledger.md`; `findings/merge.md` | **bidirectional no-downgrade gate** — re-verify vs X **+ Y-not-regressed** + Y green; reuse>duplicate-never-by-narrowing; atomic (commit iff all pass) |
| `rust-port-researcher` | sonnet (escalate ambiguous verdicts → opus) | P1 DISCOVER; per-unit on demand | parallel-capable at DISCOVER | initial run / a unit needing external or Y-context research | retry once; inconclusive → record open question + evidence, never assume | source X, dest Y, docs/web, `git-kb code` | `reports/research.md` (X-needs ⟷ Y-provides reuse map) | advisory — feeds reuse-vs-reimplement + map-onto-Y; read-only, not a pass/fail gate |
| `rust-port-cross-repo-referencer` | haiku (escalate reconciliation judgment → higher tier) | P1 DISCOVER (seed map); MERGE (refresh touched symbols) | parallel-capable at DISCOVER; per merge cycle otherwise | a merge run (`dest_repo` Y set) | retry once; empty graph for non-empty repo → re-index; still empty → `INCONCLUSIVE`, never "no references" | X, Y, substrate repos; `symbol-map.md`; `.meta.yaml`; `git-kb code`, `meta` | `reports/cross-repo-refs.md` (per-symbol blast radius + lock scope) | advisory — supplies blast radius + contract-compat flags the merge-integrator gates on; mechanical collection |
| `continuity-steward` | sonnet (per-call override; shared frontmatter stays opus) | P3 HAND OFF (at budget) | sequential, single-flight at the budget boundary | `cycles_this_session >= cycle_budget` (or STOP) | retry once; missing `baseline.md` → reconstruct verify-on-resume block + note it | `parity-ledger.md`, `symbol-map.md`, `loop_state.md`, `baseline.md`, session commit list | `HANDOFF.md` (state + pointers, the authoritative resume signal) | continuity gate — writes the cold-resume contract; no fake DONE may substitute for it |
| `evolution-steward` | opus | Phase E (runs **last** — at DONE full retro, at HAND OFF lightweight) | sequential, single-flight at the run boundary (never mid-cycle) | end of run (DONE or HAND OFF) | retry once; thin artifacts → evaluate what exists + record the gap as its own lesson | `.handoff/loop/` artifacts; CLAUDE.md change history; `LESSONS.md` | `evaluation.md`; `proposed-upgrades.md`; lessons-ledger rows; applied PR edits | **gate-strengthener only** — may evaluate and *strengthen* the parity/DONE gate, never weaken it (scope law) |

**Loop-level runtime (the schedule the runtime drives):**

- **Self-pacing** — after each committed cycle the orchestrator re-enters via `ScheduleWakeup` (P2 step 6); at HAND OFF/DONE it stops with **no** `ScheduleWakeup` and lets exactly one terminal sentinel (`DONE` / `NEEDS-HUMAN` / `HANDOFF.md`) drive the external runner.
- **Cycle budget** — `cycle_budget` (default `3`, in `loop_state.template.md`) cycles per session; `cycles_this_session` resets to `0` on RESUME. Hitting the budget routes to P3 HAND OFF, not a stop-and-ask.
- **Context budget** — a session runs cycles continuously to a ~50% context budget rather than stopping per item; only a genuine wall (`NEEDS-HUMAN`) or the cycle budget halts it.
- **Commit per cycle** — every ITERATE cycle commits one unit with its `.handoff/loop/` state (`port(<crate>): <unit> — parity verified`); truth lives on disk so any restart resumes cold with zero loss.
- **One specialist per cycle** — exactly one specialist (the porter) runs per ITERATE cycle, gated by the auditor then the verifier; the architect runs only on a structural question. This bounds coordination to a single sequential chain per cycle and is what makes the loop machine-schedulable.

## Phase 0: Context check (initial / resume / partial)

- `.handoff/loop/HANDOFF.md` exists + user says resume/continue → **RESUME** via
  `session-relay-resume` (ICM recall → weave inbox scan → read committed HANDOFF → verify-on-resume
  baseline, fail-closed → broadcast `relay:resumed` → reset `cycles_this_session=0`), continue at the
  ledger's next `- [ ]`/`- [~]` unit.
- `.handoff/loop/` exists + user asks to redo one unit/phase → **PARTIAL**: re-run only that unit.
- `.handoff/loop/` exists + `loop_state.md` shows `status: DISCOVER in-progress` (no HANDOFF) →
  **RESUME DISCOVER**: read the `discover_progress:` checklist and continue at the first `pending` item
  (the committed deliverables before it are durable — don't redo them). An interrupted DISCOVER is
  resumable, not restarted, because each deliverable was committed as it landed (Phase 1).
- `.handoff/loop/` exists + new source/scope → **NEW RUN**: move old to `.handoff/loop_prev/`.
- absent → **INITIAL**.

The orchestrator must know the **source root** (the project being ported) and the **Rust target
crate/dir**, and — for a **port-and-merge** run — the **destination repo Y** (`dest_repo`). Ask once if
not given (default `dest_repo: none` = port-only); record all in `loop_state.md`. When `dest_repo` is
set, the ITERATE cycle gains the MERGE step and DONE adds the merge conditions, and the orchestrator also
records `dest_branch`/`dest_worktree`/`dest_base` (Y is a separate repo — all Y writes happen in a
per-task **worktree** on a **feature branch**, never on Y's main; see `rust-port-merge` §Y git discipline).
**Localization directive (optional).** If the run is to translate the source's user-facing natural-language
text to the dest's shipping language (e.g. the owner asks to render MiroFish's Chinese strings in English),
record `localize: <src>-><dst>` (e.g. `localize: zh->en`); default `localize: none` keeps byte-identical
string preservation. A non-`none` directive activates the localization-parity discipline (translate
user-facing text, preserve contract strings, verify at semantic grain) — see `references/localization.md`.
**On RESUME of a merge run:** fetch Y, rebase `dest_branch` onto `dest_base`, re-index Y, and re-run the
cross-repo-referencer over the merged set — any `- [x]` merged unit whose Y blast-radius drifted drops to
`- [~]` for re-verification (Y is mutable; a merge proven against an old Y isn't proven against the new Y).

**Port-in-place (`rust_target == dest_repo` — a common config).** When the Rust port lands *directly
into an existing Rust app* that already has the foundation (no separate port crate, then merge — the port
target **is** the merge destination, e.g. porting a Python app into an existing Rust app), set
`dest_repo` = `rust_target` and the **port and merge steps collapse into one landing**: the porter lands
Rust straight into the dest's modules, so there is no "port-then-merge-into-Y" hop. In this config:
- The **merge-ledger tracks each unit's `class` + landing decision** (where in the dest it lands), but it
  does **not** re-port — `port-fresh`/`extend-Y` units are produced once by the porter directly in the
  dest; `reuse-Y`/`map-onto-substrate` units verify the dest's existing surface against X.
- The **merge condition collapses to "landed-in-dest + dest-not-regressed"** — there is no second-repo
  re-verification hop (X⟷Y *is* X⟷dest). The **parity gate doubles as the dest-regression gate**: the
  dest's own behavioral baseline (`findings/y-regression.md`, captured at DISCOVER) is the no-downgrade
  guard, run every cycle. `dest_branch`/`dest_worktree` are the port's own branch/worktree (one git
  context, one commit per cycle — the two-commit rule does not apply when there is one repo).
- All gates stay intact — collapsing the hop removes *duplicate* bookkeeping, never a check. See
  `references/merge-ledger.md` §Port-in-place.

## Phase 1: DISCOVER (initial run)

1. Seed `.handoff/loop/loop_state.md` (template in `scripts/`) with source root + Rust target + UTC start,
   and set `status: DISCOVER in-progress` with a `discover_progress:` checklist
   (`ledger/symbol-map/research/architecture/cross-repo-refs/merge-ledger/baseline` — each `pending`).
   **Commit this seed now** — DISCOVER is multi-step and long; an interrupted DISCOVER must resume cold.
2. `rust-port-cartographer` → `.handoff/loop/parity-ledger.md` (every source unit, all `- [ ]`)
   **and `.handoff/loop/symbol-map.md`** (every source symbol — fn/type/method/field/const/variant/
   trait/CLI flag/route — harvested deterministically via `git kb code symbols --json --limit -1`,
   all `- [ ]`, each `unit:`-tagged). See `references/symbol-map.md`.
3. `rust-port-researcher` → `.handoff/loop/reports/research.md` (deep research of X **and**, when
   `dest_repo` Y is set, Y — the X-needs ⟷ Y-provides **reuse map** so the port maps onto what Y
   already has instead of duplicating it). Reuses `code-research-*` + `deep-research`.
4. `rust-port-architect` → `.handoff/loop/target-architecture.md` (crate layout, idiom map, deps, and
   — informed by the reuse map — the per-unit port-and-map / reuse-vs-reimplement decisions). **When Y
   is set, also record each unit's merge `class`** (`port-fresh`/`extend-Y`/`reuse-Y`/`map-onto-substrate`)
   from the reuse map — this drives ITERATE (reuse-Y/map-onto skip the fresh port). See `references/merge-ledger.md`.
5. **When `dest_repo` Y is set:** create the Y **worktree** on a fresh **feature branch**
   (`dest_worktree` on `dest_branch` off `dest_base`); `rust-port-cross-repo-referencer` →
   `.handoff/loop/reports/cross-repo-refs.md` (cross-repo reference + blast-radius map across
   X⟷Y⟷substrates) and seed `.handoff/loop/merge-ledger.md` (one `- [ ]` row per unit, `class`-tagged).
6. `build-health-auditor` → confirm the Rust target skeleton builds (baseline) **and, when Y is set,
   that Y builds AND is runnable, and that every substrate the map-onto decisions target
   (`hf`/`weave`/`grit`/`icm`) is actually present in Y's Cargo workspace** → `.handoff/loop/baseline.md`.
   **The baseline must be EXECUTED, not asserted: actually run `cargo build` + `cargo test` against the
   exact dest tip (the `dest_base`/`dest_branch` commit you are blessing) and paste the real counts as
   evidence** ("build: 0 errors"; "test result: N passed; M ignored; 0 failed"). **A non-compiling dest
   tip is FAIL-CLOSED** — write `.handoff/loop/NEEDS-HUMAN` (or open a recorded repair task and repair to
   a clean tip before ITERATE) and record the build error; **never emit a GREEN / green-to-start verdict
   you did not run.** The baseline is the loop's entire no-downgrade reference: a green that wasn't
   executed against the real tip (a stale run, a different checkout, an upstream "it's green" claim) is a
   phantom baseline that poisons every later cycle. (Observed: a DISCOVER baseline blessed a bad-merge tip
   that did not compile as "142 tests GREEN @ c894de8" without executing it; the phantom went undetected
   for a full iteration until the cycle-1 porter couldn't build. This is a STRENGTHENING of the
   no-downgrade gate — never relax it to let a red tip pass.)
   **When Y is set, also capture Y's own behavioral baseline** (Y's existing test suite + golden fixtures
   for the symbols in each unit's Y blast-radius) → `.handoff/loop/findings/y-regression.md` — the
   reference the merge's dual no-downgrade gate diffs against.
   **Also confirm the SOURCE is runnable** — the differential parity-verifier's hard precondition is
   that it can *execute the source* (its `source_toolchain`: bun/node/python). Smoke-run the source
   (or its test suite) once here.
   **Classify runnability per unit/path, not whole-source binary** (a source is often *partly* runnable):
   - a **locally-differentiable** unit runs from local source alone (utils, models, pure pipeline) — it
     MUST be runnable for its parity gate to PASS;
   - an **external-service** unit's source path needs creds/an external SaaS to run (e.g. a cloud
     graph/memory SDK, a subprocess sim) and is a `map-onto-substrate` unit — it is verified by the
     **behavioral equivalence of the mapped dest/substrate path against the unit's contract**, NOT by
     running the source's external path. Record which units are external-service in `baseline.md`.
   **The fail-fast NEEDS-HUMAN trigger is unchanged in strength** — record `.handoff/loop/NEEDS-HUMAN`
   now and stop if: the source toolchain itself can't run at all; OR a unit that **requires running the
   source** (a locally-differentiable unit) has no runnable path; OR — for a merge — **Y** or a **named
   substrate** can't be executed/found. Only the *false* halt is removed: an external-service path that
   is map-onto-substrate-verified is **not** a wall (it never required running the source's external
   path). Fail fast at DISCOVER for a genuine wall, but do not halt on a path that was never going to be
   run differentially against the source.
7. Order the ledger by dependency (leaf modules / pure functions first; entrypoints last). See
   `references/parity-ledger.md`. Mark `status: DISCOVER complete`.

**Commit each DISCOVER deliverable as it lands — not once at the end.** After each of steps 2–7
produces its artifact, flip that item in `loop_state.md`'s `discover_progress:` to `done` and **commit
that artifact + the updated state** (`discover(<port>): <artifact> — <n>/<total>`). DISCOVER is a long,
multi-agent phase; a single end-of-phase commit means any interruption strands every partial deliverable
uncommitted and un-resumable (observed: a prior DISCOVER left ledger/research/baseline on disk but no
loop_state/symbol-map/architecture/HANDOFF, so the documented RESUME path couldn't pick it up and the
work was redone). With incremental commits + the `discover_progress:` checklist, a dropped DISCOVER
resumes at the first `pending` item. (The DONE-gate completeness sweep is unchanged — incremental commits
only make partial progress durable, never let an incomplete DISCOVER read as complete.)

## Phase 2: ITERATE (one unit per cycle)

1. Read `loop_state.md` + `parity-ledger.md`.
2. Stop checks: no `- [ ]`/`- [~]` left → go to **DONE gate**; `cycles_this_session >= cycle_budget`
   → **HAND OFF**; `.handoff/loop/STOP` present → stop.
3. Pick the top unported unit whose dependencies are `- [x]`.
4. **Branch on the unit's merge `class`** (port-only runs treat every unit as `port-fresh`):
   - `port-fresh` / `extend-Y` → **Architect** → **porter** ports it FULLY (no stubs, every branch —
     see `rust-port-translate`) → **build-health-auditor** (compiles + clippy).
     - **Architect route is MANDATORY (not "only if it looks structural") when the unit is `extend-Y`,
       needs a structural/landing decision, is `- [!] blocked` on a stub/missing wiring, OR exceeds the
       size/complexity threshold** (default: source unit > ~300 LOC, or > ~8 symbols, or any cross-module
       wiring). For such a unit the architect FIRST records a per-unit design to
       `findings/<unit>-architecture.md` — the reuse-vs-narrowing call, the substrate-mapping/facade
       decision, the de-risking of any perceived blocker (measure the blast radius before treating a stub
       as a hard wall), pre-identified `- [≠]`/`- [!]` risk flags for the no-downgrade gate, **and an
       ordered sub-cycle decomposition** (each sub-cycle independently portable + parity-verifiable in one
       loop cycle, with explicit deps). The porter then executes **one sub-cycle per cycle** against that
       recorded design — it never guesses the decomposition or the landing. Below the threshold and with no
       structural/landing decision, the architect step may be skipped (a trivial port-fresh leaf). This
       strengthens the design-decision gate; it relaxes no parity/DONE check.
   - `reuse-Y` / `map-onto-substrate` → **skip the porter** (porting then discarding what Y/substrate
     already provides is the wasted work the classification removes). Go straight to the parity gate,
     which differentially verifies **Y's existing symbol (or the substrate) against source X**. If it
     diverges, Y was only *partial* → reclassify `extend-Y` and port the missing behavior.
     - **Verify-only batching (a speed lever, not a gate relaxation).** A `reuse-Y`/`map-onto`
       verify-only step mutates no code, so the "one specialist (porter) per cycle" rule — which exists
       to bound *mutation* and keep the merge atomic — does not constrain it. The verifier MAY
       differentially adjudicate a **batch** of already-landed symbols (e.g. all symbols of one unit, or
       a contiguous verify-only block) in a single cycle/commit, **provided each symbol still gets its
       own per-symbol differential verdict** (no rollup shortcut, no "spot-checked the batch"). This is
       the late-stage pattern where a unit's surface already exists in the dest and only needs proving;
       batching cuts wall-clock without weakening the gate. A cycle that *ports or mutates* (any
       `port-fresh`/`extend-Y`) stays one-unit-per-cycle. (Evidence: MiroFish→teri cycles 64–66 batched
       14 / 3 / 1 already-landed symbols as one verify-only cycle each — per-symbol verdicts intact.)
5. **Parity gate** — `rust-port-parity-verifier` runs the differential test (source vs Rust over the
   unit's whole contract, **exercising every symbol of the unit** in `symbol-map.md`). A unit `PASS`
   requires every contract behavior to match **and all the unit's symbols to be `- [x]`/`- [≠]`**
   (rollup rule) → mark the unit `- [x]`. Any unverified symbol or divergence → leave `- [~]`/`- [!]`
   with the exact missing behavior + symbol id; do NOT commit a fake `- [x]`. **A dropped symbol or
   downgrade never passes the gate.**
   - **Dependency-unblock re-scan (accuracy — a `- [!]` is not forever).** A `- [!]` gap is often
     blocked on *another* symbol/unit ("honest-errors until U-022 is wired"). When a symbol/unit flips
     **terminal** (`- [x]`/`- [≠]`), re-scan every `- [!]` row whose recorded blocking-reason **named
     it** — the block may now be liftable. A `- [!]` whose blocker is now terminal but that was never
     re-evaluated is a stale honest-gap that silently understates coverage. (Evidence: MiroFish→teri —
     the `interview_agents` leaf honest-errored "until U-022," U-022 went terminal `- [x]` in cycle 62,
     but the leaf wasn't re-checked until cycle 64 surfaced it; the re-scan makes that automatic.) Also
     run this scan on RESUME (it is cheap and a multi-session loop accumulates such unblocks).
6. **MERGE step (only when `dest_repo` Y is set)** — for the unit just marked `- [x]`, **in the Y
   worktree (`dest_worktree` on `dest_branch`)**: `rust-port-cross-repo-referencer` refreshes the touched
   symbols' references → `rust-port-merge-integrator` integrates the unit into Y (class-driven landing,
   dup-scan before a new module, reuse>duplicate-never-by-narrowing, grit symbol-lock, breaking-contract
   *resolved* not just flagged — see `rust-port-merge`) → `build-health-auditor` (Y compiles/clippy/test)
   → `rust-port-parity-verifier` **re-runs the differential gate in Y's context** (still matches source X,
   every symbol) **AND the Y-regression diff** against Y's captured baseline (Y's own behavior preserved).
   **Atomic:** only a re-`PASS` **+ Y green + Y-not-regressed** commits the unit's Y changes to
   `dest_branch` and marks `- [x]` in `merge-ledger.md`; any failure → `git -C <dest_worktree> reset
   --hard`, release grit locks, keep `- [~]`. (Skip this step entirely when `dest_repo: none`.)
7. Write ledger(s) back, bump counters, **commit** the `.handoff/loop/` state (`port(<crate>): <unit> —
   parity verified`, or `port+merge(<crate>): <unit> — verified in Y` when merged). A merge cycle thus
   makes **two commits**: the port-repo state commit and the Y-branch commit (step 6). Self-pace
   (`ScheduleWakeup`).

## Phase 3: HAND OFF (at budget)

Invoke **`session-relay-wrap-up`** — the full wrap-up: stop-checks → Phase E lightweight retro
(`evolution-steward`) → persist durable memory to ICM → `continuity-steward` writes+commits
`.handoff/loop/HANDOFF.md` → weave `relay:handoff` heartbeat → best-effort cron successor → stop
(prefer `hf checkpoint`/`hf handoff` when the kernel is reachable). The committed HANDOFF.md is the
resume signal; a fresh session re-enters via `session-relay-resume`.

**Keep the `loop_state.md` NEXT pointer bounded.** The NEXT-on-resume pointer is the resume contract,
but appending every session's pointer onto one line grows an unreadable, slow-to-edit mega-line (a
real per-resume tax in a long loop). Keep only the **current + immediately-prior** pointer inline in
`loop_state.md`; move older pointers to `findings/next-history.md` (append-only). A smaller live state
file reads and edits faster every resume, and the full history stays durable — continuity is unchanged,
only the working-set size shrinks.

## Phase E: Evaluate & evolve (runs last — at DONE and at HAND OFF)

Invoke `evolution-steward` (`model: "opus"`, skill `harness-evolution`): evaluate the run (friction,
**gate quality** — did the parity gate miss a downgrade or false-block?, coverage, human walls),
mine generalizable lessons into the lessons ledger, and upgrade the harness — auto-applying only
low-risk in-scope edits via the standard PR flow (with a change-history row), proposing structural
changes in `.handoff/loop/proposed-upgrades.md`. It may only ever *strengthen* the parity/DONE gate,
never weaken it, and stewards only this harness (scope law). Lightweight at HAND OFF, full at DONE.

**An applied upgrade is not done until it is MERGED.** A harness upgrade left on a pushed-but-unmerged
branch with no open PR is itself drift — a vital fix nobody is running (observed: an architect-design
upgrade sat unmerged on a branch with no PR until a later session found it). So every auto-applied
evolution must reach **opened PR → auto-merge armed** in the same session, not just a pushed branch;
and the unmerged tail is surfaced — `scripts/git-hygiene.sh` flags any local branch with unmerged
commits and **no open PR** as `[3b]` ("may be FORGOTTEN"), the cue to open its PR + merge or delete it.

## DONE gate (no-downgrade, evidence-backed)

Write `.handoff/loop/DONE` only when ALL hold:
- **Left-behind sweep passes at BOTH grains** — `rust-port-cartographer` re-scans the source and
  finds zero *units* missing from the ledger and zero `- [ ]`/`- [~]` unit rows; **then re-harvests
  the full source *symbol* set (`git kb code symbols --json --limit -1`, same visibility filter) and
  finds zero symbols missing from `symbol-map.md`, zero `- [ ]`/`- [~]`/`- [!]` symbol rows, and zero
  rollup violations (every `- [x]` unit has 100% `- [x]`/`- [≠]` symbols).** A zero/empty symbol
  harvest of a non-empty source is fail-closed (`NEEDS-HUMAN`), never a vacuous `0/0` pass. (The
  completeness critic, unit + symbol.)
- Every unit is `- [x]` (parity-verified) or an explicit `- [≠]` intentional-divergence with owner
  approval — **and every symbol in `symbol-map.md` is `- [x]`/`- [≠]`** (symbols X/Y = Y/Y).
- `cargo build` + `cargo clippy -D warnings` + `cargo test` all green.
- The parity trail in `.handoff/loop/findings/parity.md` shows a passing differential test per unit.
- **When `dest_repo` Y is set (merge in scope):** the **merge ledger is 100%** — every ported unit is
  `- [x]` merged + **re-verified in Y** (or owner-approved `- [≠]`); a merge left-behind sweep finds no
  ported-but-unmerged unit; **Y's** `cargo build`/`clippy`/`test` are green; **Y is not regressed** (the
  `findings/y-regression.md` diff is clean — the dual no-downgrade gate); and no contract Y's consumers
  depend on was broken (or resolved per `rust-port-merge` §breaking-contract). Then **open the PR from
  `dest_branch` → `dest_base` with auto-merge armed**. See `references/merge-ledger.md`.
Record the evidence (unit counts, **symbol counts X/Y**, both sweep results, **and merge counts X/Y +
the Y-green + Y-not-regressed results + the Y PR link when merging**) inside `DONE`. After writing `DONE`, run **Phase E**
(full retro) so the completed port feeds the harness's evolution.

## Data transfer & error handling

- File bus: `.handoff/loop/{parity-ledger,symbol-map,merge-ledger,target-architecture,baseline,loop_state,HANDOFF}.md`,
  `findings/{parity,merge,y-regression}.md`, `reports/{inventory,research,cross-repo-refs}.md`.
- **Agent-spawn contract — drop-resilience for large/multi-file deliverables.** Any DISCOVER agent that
  produces a large or multi-file artifact (cartographer's ledger+symbol-map, architect's
  target-architecture+merge-ledger, researcher's research report) MUST **write each artifact/section to
  disk incrementally as it is produced** and **return only a short pointer-summary (<400 words), never
  the full content**. A mid-stream connection drop then strands at most the section in flight, not the
  whole phase, and the small return payload is not itself a drop risk. (A run lost an entire architect
  phase to a socket close at ~400s/29 tool-uses with nothing on disk; the incremental-write re-spawn
  succeeded.) The on-disk artifact — not the agent's message — is always the deliverable.
- **Agent-spawn contract — ignore cross-loop relay noise; always return your work-summary.** Other
  loops sharing the workspace (envctl/forge-loop, the session-relay heartbeat, weave) emit
  relay/notification traffic (`relay:resumed`, `relay:handoff`, DriftSummary, etc.) that can reach a
  sub-agent mid-run. A spawned agent MUST **ignore any relay/weave/notification message not addressed to
  its own task** and **return its own task's work-summary** (files written, what's covered, what's
  open) — never an ACK or echo of unrelated relay traffic. (A run's cycle-2 porter returned an ACK of a
  foreign envctl/forge-loop `relay:resumed` instead of its work-summary; the work was correct on disk so
  the orchestrator recovered via git, but the return was untrustworthy.) The orchestrator treats a return
  that is only a relay-ACK as a missing summary: verify the on-disk deliverable via git, don't trust it.
- **Retry once; never fake completion.** Specialist errors → `- [!]` with reason, continue other
  units. Parity FAIL → unit stays open. Human wall (needs network creds to run source, etc.) →
  `.handoff/loop/NEEDS-HUMAN`, stop. Conflicting behavior readings → keep both, verifier adjudicates.
- **The cardinal rule:** never weaken the parity gate, stub a unit, or drop a branch to make a cycle
  pass. A red parity test is honest; a fake green defeats the harness's entire purpose.

## Team size

10 agents (Large): 7 specialists (`rust-port-cartographer`, `-architect`, `-porter`,
`-parity-verifier`, `-merge-integrator`, `-researcher`, `-cross-repo-referencer`) + 3 shared
(`build-health-auditor`, `continuity-steward`, `evolution-steward`). Still **one specialist per cycle**
(porter in a port cycle; merge-integrator in the appended merge step), so coordination stays bounded —
see the **Agent runtime** table above for the full per-agent execution contract + the 3-model tiering.

## Eject

`bash scripts/eject.sh <target-repo>` copies this harness (skills + the 10 agents) into the port
repo's `.claude/` and scaffolds `.handoff/loop/`. See `references/eject.md`. Invoke as `/rust-port`
once ejected.

## Test Scenarios

**Happy path:** Port `meta/Archon` (TS/Bun) to Rust. DISCOVER inventories 600+ units into the ledger;
architect maps packages→crates, express→axum, prisma→sqlx, sets tokio+thiserror. Cycle N: porter
ports `auth-service/token.ts` fully (all 4 error branches) → builds → verifier runs source & Rust
over happy + 4 error inputs, outputs match → `- [x]`, commit. … At 100%, cartographer's sweep finds
nothing left → tests green → write `DONE`.

**Error path (attempted downgrade):** Porter ports a streaming handler as a synchronous one "for
now." Build is green, but the parity-verifier feeds a streaming input and the Rust returns all-at-once
→ `FAIL` (expected: incremental chunks; actual: single buffer). Unit stays `- [~]` with the exact
diff; the cardinal rule blocks commit. Next cycle the porter implements the streaming version.

**Error path (runtime-construct downgrade):** Porter maps Archon's `dag-executor.ts` parallel layers
onto a sequential `for` loop, and a `loop`-until-signal node onto a fixed-count loop. Build is green,
but the parity-verifier feeds a parallel workload (Rust runs layers serially → ordering/timing diff)
and a cancellation input (Rust never aborts → stuck) → `FAIL`. The runtime contract (concurrency
degree, loop-until-signal, cancellation point) is part of the ledger row per
`references/runtime-constructs.md`, so it stays `- [~]` until the executor runs layers concurrently
and honors the stop signal. Mapping onto a substrate (e.g. run-state onto `hf`) is verified the same
way — a mapped unit is differentially tested, never trusted.

**Error path (intra-unit symbol drop):** Porter ports `Config` but omits one field and one enum
variant. `cargo build` is green and the happy-path differential PASSes, but the verifier exercises
every `symbol-map.md` row for the unit: the dropped field's row stays `- [ ]` and the missing variant
`FAIL`s → by the rollup rule the unit can't reach `- [x]`. The pre-DONE symbol sweep would also catch
it as an unmapped/unverified symbol. The dropped symbol cannot hide behind the module compiling.

**Port-and-merge happy path:** Port `meta/Archon` (TS/Bun) to Rust **and merge into `harness-agent-rs`**
(`dest_repo` Y). DISCOVER: researcher's reuse map finds Y already provides durable run-state via `hf`
and messaging via `weave`, so the architect marks those units MAP-ONTO (not reimplement);
cross-repo-referencer seeds the reference map + merge-ledger. Cycle N (haiku/sonnet/opus tiered): porter
(sonnet) ports `dag-executor` layer logic → verifier (opus) PASS standalone → merge-integrator (opus)
lands it as a new `harness-agent-rs` module, grit-locks the touched Y symbols, wires it → build-health
(haiku) Y green → verifier (opus) **re-verifies in Y** → `- [x]` merged, commit. … At 100% port + 100%
merge, both sweeps clean, Y green → `DONE`.

**Error path (merge downgrade):** merge-integrator maps a streaming run-event unit onto an existing Y
helper that buffers. Y compiles, but the **re-verification in Y** feeds a streaming input → Y emits one
buffer (source streamed) → `FAIL`. The unit stays `- [~]` in the merge ledger (a standalone PASS does
not close a merge row); reuse-by-narrowing is rejected — next cycle it extends the Y helper to stream.
