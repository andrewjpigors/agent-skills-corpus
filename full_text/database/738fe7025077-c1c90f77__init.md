# DevFlow Init

Scaffold this repo's DevFlow config files. **One command does everything — do not hand-write `config.json` or guess field values.**

**Portable helper anchor (single-statement).** The bundled-helper commands in this skill resolve the skill directory inline at each call site via `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR:-<absolute skill base directory this runner reports in context>}`. When `$CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR` is set and non-empty (Claude Code), run each command exactly as written. On a runner where it is unset or empty, replace the placeholder with the skill base directory the runner reports in context (e.g. a `Base directory for this skill:` line) before running the command; if that reported path is Windows-form (`C:\...`), first convert it to this shell's POSIX form with one standalone `wslpath -u '<path>'` (WSL) or `cygpath -u '<path>'` (Git Bash/MSYS2) command and substitute the printed result **only if the command succeeds and prints a non-empty path — otherwise fall through to the drive-letter rules exactly as if the tool were absent, the same success-and-non-empty acceptance the platform's path-normalization rules apply** (if neither tool exists: lowercase the drive letter, map `C:\` to `/mnt/c` on WSL or `/c` on MSYS2, and turn backslashes into `/`; if the environment is neither WSL nor MSYS2, use the path unchanged and report that it could not be normalized — the same arm the platform's path-normalization rules take). Resolve the anchor inline at every call site — never capture it into a shell variable that a later statement reads, because some runners' inline-bash marshaling drops such variables (observed on Copilot CLI). If neither `$CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR` nor a runner-reported base directory is available, stop and report that the helper anchor could not be resolved rather than running a command with a broken path.

**Consumer prompt extension (load first).** Before doing this skill's work, load any consumer-supplied prompt extension for this skill and honor it. From the repo root, run:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR:-<absolute skill base directory this runner reports in context>}"/../../scripts/load-prompt-extension.sh init
```

If the invocation fails because the helper path does not exist (`No such file`, exit 127, or the platform equivalent), that is the **anchor-resolution** failure described in the *Portable helper anchor* note above — fix the anchor, don't report a missing extension. Otherwise, if the helper exits non-zero, a consumer extension exists but could not be loaded — surface its stderr message and do not silently proceed as if none existed. If it exits 0 and prints text, treat that text as additional instructions appended to the end of this skill's own prompt for this run — it is upgrade-safe, consumer-owned customization committed under `.devflow/prompt-extensions/`. If it exits 0 and prints nothing, proceed unchanged.

## Run

```bash
"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR:-<absolute skill base directory this runner reports in context>}"/../../scripts/scaffold-config.sh
```

This is the single shared scaffolder — the same script `install.sh` uses, so the two entry points can never drift. With no argument it targets the current repo root (git toplevel) and:

- creates `.devflow/config.json` from the shipped `config.example.json` **only if it does not already exist** — it never clobbers a config you've already filled in. When the config already exists it's kept and re-running **backfills any newly-added keys** from the example (at any nesting depth) so you can opt into new features; values you've already set always win and arrays you've tuned (e.g. `allowed_tools`) are left as-is;
- always refreshes `.devflow/config.schema.json` so your editor validates against the current field set;
- scaffolds `.devflow/prompt-extensions/` with a commented, inert `<skill-name>.md.example` for **every** skill (each with a skill-specific hint), so you discover the consumer prompt-extension convention and which skills it covers. Each example is created **only if absent** (a per-file backfill, so re-running picks up newly added examples while never overwriting an example you edited or a live `<skill-name>.md` you authored); the `.example` suffix keeps every scaffolded file inert until you deliberately rename it;
- **auto-detects the repo's language(s)** (Node, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby, PHP, .NET, Make, Docker) and **merges the matching build/test/lint tools** into `config.json` — into all three allowlists (`devflow.allowed_tools`, `devflow_implement.allowed_tools`, and `devflow_runner.allowed_tools`, which the automated reviewer consumes when `devflow_runner.provision_env: true` — see below) plus the `setup` block (`node_version` + a lockfile-appropriate install line, and a `composer install` line for PHP). When the Node `package.json`/lockfile lives in a **subdirectory** (a monorepo `frontend/` package, or a PHP/Rails app with a co-located `/jsx` or `/resources/js` bundle), it is auto-detected into `setup.node_working_directory` and the generated Node install line is scoped into that directory (a subshell `cd`) so caching and the build target the right place; a root-level build leaves `node_working_directory` empty. The `setup` block is what lets the automated reviewer build/test a PR — but only once the maintainer opts in with `devflow_runner.provision_env: true` (see "Letting the reviewer build/test a PR" in docs/cloud-setup.md). The merge is an **idempotent union**: it never removes your custom entries and never duplicates, so re-running after adding a language picks up only the new tools.

It resolves the templates from the installed plugin (`"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR:-<absolute skill base directory this runner reports in context>}"/../../.devflow/`), so it works whether DevFlow was installed via the marketplace or vendored by `install.sh`.

## Then: verify the runtime dependencies are present

The scaffolder needs only `jq`, but **running** DevFlow's skills needs more — and **PyYAML is the one dependency people miss**, because `/plugin install` resolves companion *plugins* and never runs `pip`. Config itself is JSON (read by a python3 resolver, no PyYAML), so a missing PyYAML doesn't break scaffolding — but it silently degrades the runtime Python helper that parses YAML blocks in PR bodies (`match-deferrals.py`). So after scaffolding, run the preflight check and surface any gap:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR:-<absolute skill base directory this runner reports in context>}"/../../lib/preflight.sh
```

This verifies `git`, `gh`, `jq`, `python3` (>=3.11), and **PyYAML**, printing an actionable line per missing item and exiting non-zero if any is absent. It's **advisory** — scaffolding already succeeded, so a non-zero exit here is a dependency gap to *report*, not an init failure. **Never run `pip` yourself**: DevFlow deliberately keeps `pip` out of the plugin/init path, so relay the install command and let the user run it (see "After running"). Read the result and respond per the matching branch below.

## Then: provision the local Claude Code settings

Keeping the DevFlow plugin auto-updated otherwise needs a hand-edited Claude Code settings file. This step provisions that into the repo's **project** `.claude/settings.json` so adopters get it as a one-command outcome of `/devflow:init` instead of a manual edit they have to find in the docs:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR:-<absolute skill base directory this runner reports in context>}"/../../scripts/provision-local-settings.sh
```

With no argument it targets the current repo root and **deep-merges** the marketplace registration into `.claude/settings.json`, **additively and without clobbering anything you already set** (the user's value wins at every depth — same no-clobber discipline as the config scaffolder):

- `extraKnownMarketplaces["devflow-marketplace"]` (a `github` source for `The01Geek/devflow-autopilot`, `autoUpdate: true`) and `enabledPlugins["devflow@devflow-marketplace"] = true`, so Claude Code keeps the DevFlow plugin updated automatically.

It is **local/interactive-tier only** — the cloud (CI) tier uses claude-code-action's own allowlist profile and consumes no local marketplace install, so this helper is **not** wired into the shared scaffolder and a cloud-only `install.sh` run writes no `.claude/settings.json`. It is **idempotent** (re-running after the keys exist changes nothing) and writes **no** `permissions.defaultMode`.

> **Selectable `auto` mode is provisioned separately, at user scope.** Setting `env.CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_AUTO_MODE` takes effect only from **user scope** (`~/.claude/settings.json`) or managed settings — Claude Code filters permission-gating env vars out of project scope, so writing it into the project `.claude/settings.json` would be a silent no-op. The project provisioner above therefore never writes it; the **next step** provisions it into user scope, behind explicit consent. Never claim `/devflow:init` *enables* or *turns on* auto mode — at most it makes auto mode **selectable** (the user still has to choose it in the Shift+Tab cycle, and plan/model/admin gates still apply).

## Then: optionally make `auto` mode selectable (user scope — with consent)

**Provider pre-check (do this first — it gates the whole step).** `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_AUTO_MODE` has **no effect on the Anthropic API** — `auto` mode is already available there by default — and only does anything on the third-party providers (Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, Microsoft Foundry). So before prompting for anything, read the provider env vars: the provider is **third-party iff** one of `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX`, or `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY` is set to a **truthy** value (Claude Code's docs enable these with `1`; the backstop additionally accepts `true` case-insensitively as a defensive superset, and treats empty, `0`, and anything else as off). **On Anthropic-direct (none truthy), skip this entire step silently** — do **not** show the consent prompt, do **not** invoke `provision-auto-mode.sh`, and post **no** user-facing note about it (provisioning the var would be a pointless user-global write that makes nothing selectable that wasn't already). Only when the provider is third-party do you continue with the consent-gated flow below. This is the skill half of a two-layer gate: `provision-auto-mode.sh --apply` enforces the **same** provider check as a deterministic backstop (it skips with a `devflow-automode:` breadcrumb and exit 0 on Anthropic-direct), so correctness never depends on this pre-check — the pre-check only spares the Anthropic-direct user a prompt they'd never act on.

`auto` permission mode only appears in the Shift+Tab cycle when `env.CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_AUTO_MODE="1"` is set in **user-scope** `~/.claude/settings.json` (or managed settings) — see the no-op note above for why the project file can't do it. Because `~/.claude/settings.json` is **user-global** — it affects *every* one of the user's projects, not just this repo — `/devflow:init` must never edit it silently. So this step (on a third-party provider) is **consent-gated**:

1. **Ask first.** Tell the user that making `auto` selectable means adding `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_AUTO_MODE="1"` to their **user-global** `~/.claude/settings.json` (affecting all their projects), that it is **selectable only** — never turned on for them, and plan/model/admin gates still apply — and ask whether they want DevFlow to add it now. Default to **not** writing.
2. **If they decline, or you cannot ask** (non-interactive run), invoke the helper with **no flag** — it prints the exact one-line setting for the user to add themselves and writes **nothing**:
   ```bash
   "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR:-<absolute skill base directory this runner reports in context>}"/../../scripts/provision-auto-mode.sh
   ```
3. **Only if the user explicitly consents,** pass `--apply` so the helper performs the user-scope write:
   ```bash
   "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR:-<absolute skill base directory this runner reports in context>}"/../../scripts/provision-auto-mode.sh --apply
   ```

With `--apply` it targets `~/.claude/settings.json` and **deep-merges** `env.CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_AUTO_MODE="1"` additively and **without clobbering anything the user already set** — including a deliberately-disabled `"0"`, which it **preserves** and reports as "nothing changed" (it never flips a `"0"` to `"1"`). The merge is **idempotent**, **atomic** (mktemp + same-dir mv), and **fail-closed**: a malformed or wrong-shaped `~/.claude/settings.json` is left byte-for-byte unchanged with a specific `devflow-automode:` breadcrumb and a non-zero exit. It writes **no** `permissions.defaultMode` — `auto` stays selectable, never on.

Read the helper's `devflow-automode:` line and respond:

- **`provisioned … 'auto' is now SELECTABLE …`** — the user consented and `~/.claude/settings.json` gained `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_AUTO_MODE="1"`. Tell the user `auto` is now **selectable** in the Shift+Tab cycle (not on — they pick it, and plan/model/admin gates still apply), and to review the change. Do **not** claim auto mode was enabled or turned on.
- **`… already sets CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_AUTO_MODE="1" — 'auto' is already selectable; nothing changed`** — idempotent re-run; `auto` is already selectable. Nothing to report beyond that.
- **`… already sets CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_AUTO_MODE="…" (your value is preserved) — 'auto' is NOT selectable …; nothing changed`** — the user has a deliberate non-`"1"` value (e.g. a `"0"`) that was **preserved**. Relay that their value was kept and that `auto` is therefore **not** selectable; do **not** offer to flip it (the disable was deliberate — they can re-run with consent themselves if they change their mind).
- **the no-flag copy-paste output** (they declined, or you couldn't ask) — relay the one-line setting and tell the user they can add it to `~/.claude/settings.json` themselves, or re-run `/devflow:init` and consent.
- **`auto mode is available by default on the Anthropic API; nothing to provision …`** — the deterministic provider backstop fired (the provider was Anthropic-direct). You should not normally see this, because the provider pre-check above already skips the step on Anthropic-direct without invoking the helper; if you do (e.g. you invoked it anyway), say nothing to the user — it was a no-op and `auto` was already available.
- **`existing … is not readable …`**, **`… is not valid JSON …`**, **`… is malformed for provisioning …`**, or **`no usable jq (missing or not executable) …`** (exit 2) — relay the specific breadcrumb; the file was left **byte-for-byte unchanged**. Tell them to fix or remove the file (or install jq — or set `DEVFLOW_JQ` to a working `jq`/`jq.exe`, the breadcrumb's own remedy), then re-run. Do **not** hand-edit `~/.claude/settings.json` yourself.

## Then: enrich the `setup` block by exploring the repo

The scaffolder's language detection is a **deterministic floor** (marker file → known tool list + install line). It cannot infer a project's **service dependencies, runtime versions, or extensions** — those need judgement, which is your job. After it runs, **read the repo and fill in the `setup` fields a marker→list table can't**, editing `.devflow/config.json` directly (it's schema-validated; see `config.schema.json` for every field). Add **only what the project's tests actually need** — each addition runs in the cloud tier.

Inspect these sources and populate accordingly:

- **Service containers (`setup.services`)** — read `docker-compose.yml` / `compose.yaml`, `.env` / `.env.example`, framework DB config (e.g. `config/database.*`, `settings.py`, `application.yml`), `phpunit.xml`/test config, and any **pre-existing** `.github/workflows/*.yml` CI. If the test suite needs a database/cache/queue (MySQL, Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ, …), add an entry per service with `name`, `image` (pin a version matching the project), `ports` (`["3306:3306"]`), `env` (credentials/db name the tests expect), and an `options` **array** with a health check so readiness is awaited — e.g. `["--health-cmd=mysqladmin ping -h 127.0.0.1", "--health-interval=5s", "--health-timeout=5s", "--health-retries=20"]` (one complete docker arg per element). Services are reachable on **`127.0.0.1:<host-port>`**, so make sure the project's *test* DB host is `127.0.0.1`/`localhost` (set it via `setup.install` or a test env file if needed).
- **PHP runtime (`setup.php_version`, `setup.php_extensions`)** — from `composer.json`'s `require.php` constraint set `php_version` (e.g. `"8.3"`); from `require`'s `ext-*` entries **and the services you added** set `php_extensions` (CSV) — e.g. a MySQL service implies `pdo_mysql`, a Redis service implies `redis`. Common: `"mbstring, intl, pdo_mysql, redis, bcmath"`.
- **Build/test commands (`setup.install`)** — the deterministic pass already adds `npm ci`/`composer install`. Add anything else the tests depend on running first, e.g. `npm run build` when tests need compiled assets, DB migrations (`php artisan migrate --env=testing`), or a test `.env` copy. Order matters — these run top-to-bottom after the language/PHP setup and service startup.
- **Tools the presets missed** — if the project drives tests through a tool not in `tool-presets.json` (a task runner, a custom binary), enrich the allowlists per the next section.

This **complements** the preset floor; don't re-add what detection already wrote. Then tell the user to **review every addition before committing** and flag the security implication (next section).

## Then: enrich the three allowlists by exploring the repo's real build/test/lint setup

The preset floor (`detect-project-tools.sh` + `tool-presets.json`) is a deterministic marker→tool-list lookup. It is intentionally conservative and will miss project-specific tooling. **Explore the repo's actual build/test/lint setup** — `Makefile`, `package.json` scripts, `composer.json` scripts, `pyproject.toml`/`tox.ini`, `justfile`/`Taskfile.yml`, CI workflows, test-runner configs — and add anything the presets missed to all three allowlists, editing `.devflow/config.json` directly:

- `devflow.allowed_tools` — the light `/devflow:*` command path.
- `devflow_implement.allowed_tools` — `/devflow:implement` (this path legitimately needs `Edit`/`Write`; it writes code).
- `devflow_runner.allowed_tools` — the automated reviewer's build/verify tools, appended to its read-only profile **only when `devflow_runner.provision_env: true`**, read from the trusted base ref.

**Attach a one-line justification to every entry you add** (in your message to the user, e.g. "`Bash(go:*)` — repo is Go; `go build`/`go test` drive verification"). **Grant *enough* access for the automations to be effective** — a reviewer that can't run the project's real `make test` / `cargo test` / `go build` is crippled and will punt build-dependent claims. Worked examples:

- Go repo → `devflow_runner.allowed_tools`: `Bash(go:*)` (build/test/vet), `Bash(golangci-lint:*)` (lint). Justify: "reviewer compiles + lints the PR."
- Rust repo → `Bash(cargo:*)`, `Bash(rustc:*)`. Justify: "`cargo test`/`cargo clippy` are the verification path."
- Make-driven repo → `Bash(make:*)`. Justify: "tests run via `make test`."

### Security — the `pull_request_target` + write-token threat model

The automated reviewer fires on `pull_request_target` with a `pull-requests: write` token, and when `provision_env` is on it runs the **PR author's** build code. So when enriching `devflow_runner.allowed_tools`:

- **Prefer narrow scoped patterns.** `Bash(go test:*)` is safer than `Bash(go:*)` when only test is needed; scope to the subcommand the reviewer actually uses.
- **Never add a deny-listed tool to *any* allowlist.** The runner deterministically strips file-mutation tools (`Edit`, `Write`, `MultiEdit`, `NotebookEdit`) and raw-shell/eval/privilege Bash (`Bash(bash:*)`, `Bash(sh:*)`, `Bash(zsh:*)`, `Bash(eval:*)`, `Bash(exec:*)`, `Bash(source:*)`, `Bash(sudo:*)`) from the reviewer's profile and warns — so proposing one is pointless for the reviewer and dangerous everywhere else. Do not propose any of them.
- **Tell the maintainer to review `config.json` before committing**, and to keep `provision_env` off (the default) unless they accept running untrusted PR build steps.

## After running

Read the scaffolder's output line and respond accordingly:

- **`scaffolded …`** — a fresh `.devflow/config.json` was created. Every value has a working default, so it's usable as-is; tell the user they only need to edit it to customize (their editor validates against `config.schema.json`).
- **`keeping existing …`** — they already had a `config.json`; their values were preserved. It may be followed by **`backfilled newly-added keys …`** when the upgrade added keys the example gained since their config was written (existing values and arrays untouched) — tell the user to review the small diff before committing. If only `keeping existing …` prints, the config already had every key and nothing changed.

The scaffolder also prints `devflow-detect:` lines from the language auto-detection. Read them and respond:

- **`detected: <langs> — merged …`** — build/test tools for those languages were added to `config.json`. **Tell the user to review the additions before committing.** The `devflow_runner.allowed_tools` entries reach the automated reviewer only when `devflow_runner.provision_env: true` is set in the base-branch config, which runs the PR author's `setup.install` + build steps on `pull_request_target` with a write token. The flag and the freeform allowlist are read only from the base branch, so a PR can't enable it or grant itself tools, and the runner strips the deny-listed tier regardless; but enabling `provision_env` is opting into running untrusted build steps. If they want the reviewer read-only (the default), leave `provision_env` unset/false. The `devflow.allowed_tools` / `devflow_implement.allowed_tools` entries take effect in their own workflows.
- **`detected: <langs> — config.json already covers them`** — idempotent re-run, nothing changed.
- **`no known language markers detected`** or **`no usable jq (missing or not executable) …`** — no auto-population happened; the reviewer stays read-only. To make the reviewer build/test PRs they must set `devflow_runner.provision_env: true` and populate the `setup` block (see `config.schema.json` / docs/cloud-setup.md).

Read the settings provisioner's `devflow-settings:` line and respond:

- **`provisioned … (added: …)`** — the project `.claude/settings.json` gained the listed DevFlow keys (the `devflow-marketplace` registration is now auto-updating). **Tell the user to review the change before committing.** Do **not** claim *this* (project-scope) step enabled or made auto mode selectable — selectable `auto` mode is the separate user-scope step above (`provision-auto-mode.sh`).
- **`… already has the DevFlow keys; nothing changed`** — idempotent re-run; the settings already had every key. Nothing to report beyond that it was already set up.
- **`existing … is not readable …`**, **`existing … is not valid JSON …`**, or **`existing … is malformed for provisioning …`** (exit 2) — the existing `.claude/settings.json` is unusable: it is unreadable (permissions), it does not parse as JSON, or it parses but has the wrong shape (a non-object root, or a DevFlow key the merge needs as an object — e.g. `extraKnownMarketplaces` or the `devflow-marketplace` entry — present as a non-object). The helper left it **byte-for-byte unchanged** and provisioned nothing. Relay the specific breadcrumb to the user; for the not-readable case tell them to fix the file permissions, otherwise to fix or remove the file — then re-run `/devflow:init`. Do **not** hand-edit the settings file yourself.
- **`no usable jq (missing or not executable) …`** (exit 2) — relay the gap (the breadcrumb names the `DEVFLOW_JQ` remedy); the marketplace settings were not provisioned. (The same `jq` the scaffolder needs.)

Then branch on the preflight **exit code** (the durable signal — every line it prints carries the stable `devflow preflight:` prefix, but the wording can change; the exit code won't):

- **Exit 0** (the `devflow preflight: all dependencies present.` line) — the local tier is ready to run; nothing to report.
- **Non-zero exit** (one or more `devflow preflight: …` lines on stderr — a `missing required tool`, `PyYAML not found`, or `Python 3.11+ required` gap) — relay it to the user verbatim and tell them to install the gap themselves before running `/devflow:implement` or `/devflow:review`. For the common case (PyYAML missing), the fix is `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (preflight also prints its own `pip install pyyaml` hint). **Do not run `pip` for them** and **do not treat this as an init failure** — the config was still scaffolded.

There is **no trigger label** to create: in the cloud tier, `/devflow:implement` is started by commenting a bare `/devflow:implement <#>` on the issue (a native user event) — not by applying a label. The sender must be an allowed bot or an `allowed_users` collaborator with write access.

DevFlow does, however, stamp a single reserved **provenance** label — the literal `DevFlow` — on every issue and PR it creates, so the weekly retrospective can detect its own work independently of branch naming. Create that label now (best-effort, only here where `gh` is available — never in `scaffold-config.sh`, which must run without `gh` auth on the vendoring path) so it exists from day one:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR:-<absolute skill base directory this runner reports in context>}"/../../scripts/ensure-label.sh DevFlow
```

`ensure-label.sh` always exits 0 — it creates the label, treats an already-exists outcome as success, and logs a breadcrumb on a real `gh` failure — so a label-creation failure (no auth, offline) **never fails init**. Report a one-line note if it logged a failure, then continue.

If the scaffolder exits non-zero (exit 2 = templates not found next to the script), the plugin install is incomplete. Tell the user to reinstall/update the DevFlow plugin (or run `install.sh` for the cloud tier). **Do not fall back to hand-writing the files** — that reintroduces exactly the drift this skill exists to prevent.

## Finally: advisory project-memory check (CLAUDE.md)

Config is scaffolded and the preflight has run, so init has **already succeeded** — this last step is a purely **advisory project-memory check** that **never creates, writes, or edits** `CLAUDE.md` (or any agent-instruction file) and **never blocks or fails init** regardless of what it finds. A repo with no `CLAUDE.md` gives DevFlow's automations no project memory, so `/devflow:review` and `/devflow:implement` run without the conventions, gotchas, and architecture notes that materially improve their output — and new adopters (the people running `/devflow:init`) are the ones most likely to be missing it. Surface that gap once, here, without ever touching a file.

Resolve the repo root and probe for the relevant files using only `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and POSIX `test -f` (no GNU-only flags, so macOS/BSD behave identically). **Resolve the root defensively** — if `git rev-parse` fails (init run outside a git repo, or a corrupt/missing `.git`) it would otherwise leave `$ROOT` empty and every probe would test `/CLAUDE.md`, falsely reporting "absent" and emitting a misleading nudge; silence its stderr and **skip the whole check** (emit nothing) when the root can't be resolved — the step is advisory, so a non-repo invocation must produce no output rather than a wrong one:

```bash
ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)" || ROOT=
# Cannot resolve the repo root → skip the advisory check entirely (never probe "/").
[ -n "$ROOT" ] || return 0 2>/dev/null || exit 0
# CLAUDE.md detection is repo-root only (nested package-level, ~/.claude, and the
# gitignored personal-override CLAUDE.local.md are all deliberately out of scope —
# the nudge is about committed, team-shared project memory).
[ -f "$ROOT/CLAUDE.md" ] && echo "claude-md: present" || echo "claude-md: absent"
# AGENTS.md is matched across its common spellings — plural/singular AND any case
# (`AGENTS.md`/`agents.md`/`AGENT.md`/`agent.md`) — rather than a GNU-only `find -iname`.
# (Only the case axis is true case-insensitivity, and only on a case-insensitive FS like
# macOS — a Linux-only casing such as `Agents.md` is not probed; the singular forms are a
# different spelling, not a casing.) These all denote one logical convention, so report it
# AT MOST ONCE: a case-insensitive FS makes a file's case-variants all match, and a repo
# carrying both plural and singular still warrants a single nudge. First match wins.
# Accumulate the deduped hits into $detected (filenames are space-free) so the
# CLAUDE.md-present check below reuses this exact list instead of re-globbing.
detected=
agents_seen=
for f in "AGENTS.md" "agents.md" "AGENT.md" "agent.md"; do
  [ -f "$ROOT/$f" ] && { [ -n "$agents_seen" ] || { echo "agent-file: $f"; detected="$detected $f"; }; agents_seen=1; }
done
# The remaining files have a single canonical casing — no dedup needed.
for f in ".github/copilot-instructions.md" "GEMINI.md" ".cursorrules"; do
  [ -f "$ROOT/$f" ] && { echo "agent-file: $f"; detected="$detected $f"; }
done

The `@`-import paths you cite are **repo-root-relative**, matching how Claude Code resolves `CLAUDE.md` imports — `@AGENTS.md`, `@.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `@GEMINI.md`, `@.cursorrules`. When `CLAUDE.md` is present, check **every** detected agent file the same loop-driven way (don't hand-pick one) — for each existing file, grep `CLAUDE.md` for its `@`-path and treat a miss as an unreferenced file. **Reuse the exact deduped list the detection above emitted** (its `agent-file:` names — capture them into `$detected`), in the **same shell** so `$ROOT` is still set; do **not** re-probe/re-glob here, or the AGENTS.md dedup would be undone and one physical file flagged under several spellings again:

```bash
# `$detected` = the deduped `agent-file:` names captured from the detection above (one
# entry per physical file) — NOT a fresh re-glob.
# Case-insensitive match (-i): on a case-insensitive FS the casing reported above may
# differ from how the user actually wrote the @-import in CLAUDE.md (e.g. detected
# `@AGENTS.md` vs a written `@agents.md`), and a case-sensitive grep would then falsely
# flag a correctly-wired import as unreferenced. Matching case-insensitively errs toward
# silence (the safe, advisory direction).
# Only the CLAUDE.md-present cases (matrix 3/4) consult these imports — gate the loop on
# CLAUDE.md's existence explicitly, so on the no-CLAUDE.md paths it can never grep a missing
# target (don't lean on the rc>=2 swallow below as the only thing keeping case 1/2 quiet).
if [ -f "$ROOT/CLAUDE.md" ]; then
  for f in $detected; do
    grep -qiF "@$f" "$ROOT/CLAUDE.md"; rc=$?
    # rc 0 = referenced; rc 1 = genuinely no match → unreferenced; rc>=2 = grep read error
    # (vanished/unreadable CLAUDE.md after the test -f) → stay silent, don't misreport it as
    # unreferenced. Discriminating the codes keeps the step erring toward silence.
    [ "$rc" -eq 1 ] && echo "unreferenced: @$f"
  done
fi
```

Compose output per this four-case matrix, and **say nothing when nothing is actionable** (so successful re-runs stay clean):

- **No `CLAUDE.md`, no detected agent file** → emit exactly **one** nudge: recommend the built-in `/init` command to create a `CLAUDE.md`, noting that project memory improves DevFlow's review/implement results. (Say nothing about `@`-imports — there is nothing to reuse.)
- **No `CLAUDE.md`, one or more detected agent files present** → the same nudge to the built-in `/init`, **plus** name each existing file and tell the user to reference it from the new `CLAUDE.md` via its `@`-import path (e.g. "you already have `AGENTS.md` — reference it with `@AGENTS.md`"). Emit **one** nudge per *physical* file — the detection above already collapses AGENTS.md's spelling/case variants to a single entry, so never cite the same file under several spellings.
- **`CLAUDE.md` present but it does not already reference an existing detected agent file** → suggest adding that file's `@`-import to `CLAUDE.md` (name the file and its `@`-path); no `/init` nudge.
- **`CLAUDE.md` present and it already references each existing detected agent file via `@`-import (or no such files exist)** → produce **no project-memory output** at all.

Remember: the built-in `/init` is a *different* command from `/devflow:init` (it lives in Claude Code itself) — recommend it, but never run it on the user's behalf here. The whole step is a relay, exactly like the preflight branch above.
