# /gate Command (Execute Quality Gate)
# Note: Gate 3/4 will NOT pass without their respective evidence files in .tad/evidence/reviews/

## 🎯 自动触发条件

**Claude 应主动调用此 skill 的场景：**

### 必须执行 Gate 的时机
- **Gate 1**: Alex 完成 3-5 轮需求挖掘后，**进入设计前**
- **Gate 2**: Alex 完成设计，**创建 handoff 前**
- **Gate 3**: Blake 完成实现，**提交代码前**
- **Gate 4**: Blake 完成集成，**交付用户前**

### ⚠️ 强制规则
```
规则 1: Alex 创建 handoff → 必须先执行 Gate 2
规则 2: Blake 完成实现 → 必须执行 Gate 3
规则 3: Blake 完成集成 → 必须执行 Gate 4
规则 4: Gate 不通过 → 阻塞下一步，必须修复
```

### 如何激活
```
场景 1: Alex 准备创建 handoff
Alex: 设计已完成，准备创建 handoff
     → 必须先调用 /gate 2
     [调用 Skill tool with skill="tad-gate" args="2"]

场景 2: Blake 实现完成
Blake: 代码已实现，准备提交
      → 必须先调用 /gate 3
      [调用 Skill tool with skill="tad-gate" args="3"]
```

**核心原则**: Gate 是强制检查点，不可跳过

When this command is triggered, execute the appropriate quality gate based on current context:

## Gate Detection and Execution

```
Quality Gate Execution
======================

Detecting current context...

Available Gates:
1. Gate 1: Requirements Clarity (Agent A - After elicitation)
2. Gate 2: Design Completeness (Agent A - Before handoff)
3. Gate 3: Implementation Quality (Agent B - After coding)
4. Gate 4: Integration Verification (Agent B - Before delivery)

Which gate to execute? (1-4):
```

## Gate 1: Requirements Clarity (Alex) - Optional Quick Check
# ═══ Gate Checklist Items (inline — derived from canonical) ═══
# Canonical source: .tad/gates/gate-canonical-checklist.md
# Edit canonical FIRST, then sync here. Drift check: diff canonical vs this section.
```yaml
When: After Socratic Inquiry, before *design
Owner: Agent A (Alex)
Quick Check (4 items):
  - [ ] Problem defined — 问题定义清晰（Socratic Q2）
  - [ ] User identified — ICP 或目标用户已定义（Socratic Q1）
  - [ ] Scope bounded (including edge cases) — 范围、排除项、边界条件明确
  - [ ] Acceptance criteria verifiable — 每个 AC 有可运行的验证方法
Output: Quick summary, no formal evidence required
```

## Gate 2: Design Completeness (Alex) - **MANDATORY** 🔴
# ═══ Gate Checklist Items (inline — derived from canonical) ═══
# Canonical source: .tad/gates/gate-canonical-checklist.md
# Edit canonical FIRST, then sync here. Drift check: diff canonical vs this section.
```yaml
When: Before creating handoff (BLOCKING)
Owner: Agent A (Alex)
Critical Check (6 items):
  - [ ] Expert review complete (min 2)
  - [ ] All P0 resolved
  - [ ] Architecture complete
  - [ ] Components specified
  - [ ] Functions verified
  - [ ] Data flow mapped
Evidence: Record in handoff header
Output Format:
  ### Gate 2 Result
  | Item | Status | Note |
  |------|--------|------|
  | Architecture | ✅ Pass | ... |
  | Components | ✅ Pass | ... |
  | Functions | ⚠️ Partial | 缺少 xxx |
  | Data Flow | ✅ Pass | ... |
```

## Gate 3: Implementation Quality (Blake) - **MANDATORY** 🔴
> Gate 3 is UNIVERSAL across all task_types. Its checks come from the active handoff's
> §9.1 Spec Compliance Checklist (the PRIMARY VERIFICATION SOURCE), not from hardcoded
> tsc/test/lint. When any §9.1 AC references rubric scoring or an independent judge, the
> `## Rubric Evaluation Protocol` section below ACTIVATES.

## Rubric Evaluation Protocol
> UNIVERSAL Gate section (not deliverable-only). ACTIVATES when any §9.1 AC references rubric
> scoring or an independent judge (e.g. a §9.1 AC whose Verification Method is "spawn independent
> judge per Rubric Evaluation Protocol against rubric X → verdict: PASS"). Applies to ANY task_type
> whose §9.1 contains such an AC — not just `task_type: deliverable`. When no §9.1 AC references a
> rubric/judge, this section is inert (skipped). The SAFETY logic below is migrated byte-exact from
> the former Gate 3 deliverable branch — it is the anti-self-scoring backbone for rubric-based ACs.
```yaml
Activation: "Triggered from Gate 3 Spec_Compliance_Verification.rubric_ac_trigger — a §9.1 AC references rubric scoring / independent judge. Otherwise inert (no rubric AC → skip)."
Owner: "Gate/Conductor executes (spawns the judge); the producing agent revises on PARTIAL/FAIL"

# ⚠️ judge ≠ producer (BLOCKING) — contract §C — anti-self-scoring backbone (migrated byte-exact)
Judge_Not_Producer:
  hard_rule: |
    The deliverable is produced by ONE agent (a Conductor-spawned producer sub-agent /
    the Conductor). The rubric score is computed by a SEPARATE judge sub-agent, spawned
    fresh by the gate/Conductor, whose prompt references ONLY {deliverable_paths} +
    {rubric_ref} + {pass_threshold}. judge ≠ producer is defined relative to THIS producer
    (if the Conductor itself produced, the judge MUST be a distinct sub-agent).
  why: "self-enhancement bias ~10-15% inflation when an agent scores its own output (ai-evaluation: Judge ≠ Optimizer/Producer). A self-scored rubric is validation theater."
  forbidden:
    - "VIOLATION: the producing agent (or same session/persona) computes the rubric score for its own deliverable."
    - "VIOLATION: passing the producer's reasoning / 'why this is good' notes into the judge prompt."
    - "VIOLATION: reusing the producer sub-agent (or its conversation) as the judge."
    - "VIOLATION (artifact-channel): the judge crediting self-assessment / quality-claim prose embedded INSIDE the artifact (self-praise, a producer-written self-scored rubric table). The judge scores on RUBRIC EVIDENCE it independently derives from the artifact's substance — NOT on the artifact's own claims about its quality. Self-praise in the artifact is ignored, not credited."
    - "VIOLATION: 'the producer already self-scored, so skip the judge' rationalization (the 'Express → exempt' anti-pattern applied to scoring)."

Verdict_Mapping:

  # ── verdict_shape: categorical (e.g. product-thinking BUILD/PIVOT/KILL) ──
  categorical:
    rule: |
      The judge assigns a RIGOR band from the rubric: rigorous | partial | superficial.
      rigorous → PASS · partial → PARTIAL · superficial → FAIL
    rigor_independence: |
      ⚠️ The band scores the RIGOR of the analysis, NOT its content conclusion. For
      BUILD/PIVOT/KILL packs: a rigorously-argued KILL is `rigorous` (PASS); a hand-wavy
      BUILD is `superficial` (FAIL). The judge MUST NOT raise or lower the band based on
      whether the artifact concluded BUILD vs PIVOT vs KILL.
    decoupling_firewall: |
      (P1-1 hardening — structural, not just prose:)
      1. ORDER OF EMISSION: the judge MUST write `band:` WITH its per-dimension rigor
         justification BEFORE it states `content_verdict:`. The band is committed before the
         conclusion is named, so the conclusion cannot anchor the band.
      2. CONCLUSION-NEUTRAL CRITERIA: the rubric's band criteria (Phase 2) MUST be phrased
         about rigor (evidence depth, fatal-flaw coverage, FACT/ASSUMPTION discipline,
         adapter use) — NEVER "concludes BUILD" / "is optimistic".
      3. SWAP TEST (stated in the judge prompt): "If you flipped this artifact's final
         BUILD/PIVOT/KILL word and changed nothing else, would the band change? If yes, you
         are scoring the conclusion — re-score on rigor only."
    extra_output: |
      The rubric-eval ALSO emits (own lines, for traceability — NOT gate-determining):
        band: rigorous|partial|superficial
        content_verdict: BUILD|PIVOT|KILL   (the artifact's own conclusion; recorded, never maps to gate verdict)
      The machine-readable `verdict: PASS|PARTIAL|FAIL` line (derived from band) remains the Gate 4 token.
      ⚠️ `band:` (with justification) MUST appear ABOVE `content_verdict:` in the file (order firewall).
  # ── verdict_shape: checklist (e.g. ai-voice / video-creation export specs) ──
  checklist:
    malformed_guard: |
      (P1-2 guard:) the rubric MUST define ≥1 REQUIRED item. A checklist rubric with zero
      required items → BLOCK Gate 3 ("malformed checklist rubric — cannot ever FAIL, define
      ≥1 required item"). This prevents an all-optional rubric from becoming a gate that
      always PASSes.
    rule: |
      The rubric lists REQUIRED items + OPTIONAL items (export-spec pass/fail: dB / format / duration).
      ALL required pass                     → PASS
      ALL required pass, ≥1 optional fail   → PARTIAL
      ANY required fail                     → FAIL
    evidence_independence: |
      (P1-2 artifact-channel guard:) the judge derives each item's pass/fail from the
      artifact's substance / measurable specs it independently checks — NEVER from the
      artifact's own claim that it passed (same Judge_Not_Producer artifact-channel rule).
    extra_output: |
      The rubric-eval emits a per-item | item | required? | pass/fail | table; the
      `verdict:` line is derived per the rule above.
  on_pass: "Gate 3 proceeds (KA + git checks)."

  evidence: |
    Gate 3 PASS evidence exists. For code/mixed handoffs this is the §9.1-driven Gate 3
    result + any test/review evidence the §9.1 ACs declared. For rubric-based handoffs it is
    .tad/evidence/reviews/*-rubric-eval-*.md with the machine-readable line `verdict: PASS`.

    message: |
      ⚠️ Gate 4 无法执行 - Gate 3 未完成

  process:
    step1: "Read completion report Friction Status table."
    step2: "If table is missing → WARN (backward compat for pre-Friction-Protocol handoffs)."
    step3: |
      For each row:
      - BLOCKED → Gate 4 cannot accept. Alex must resolve or return to Blake.
      - DEGRADED_WITH_APPROVAL → verify approval source, date/context, accepted risk, rationale
        are present and substantiated. Unsubstantiated degradation prevents acceptance.
      - EQUIVALENT_SUBSTITUTE → verify replacement description, equivalence reasoning, and
        evidence path. Self-review as substitute for expert review → REJECT.
      - READY / NOT_APPLICABLE_WITH_REASON → accepted.
  note: "Alex does NOT re-perform Gate 3 technical validation. This is business-acceptance review of friction handling evidence."
  optional_advisory_checker: |
    Optional advisory smoke alarm (Phase 2):
      bash .tad/hooks/lib/friction-status-check.sh <completion-report.md>
    Same tool as Gate 3 advisory. Alex may run it before Gate 4 acceptance to catch report drift.

# ⚠️ TASK-TYPE CONDITIONALITY (BLOCKING for code/mixed) — structural role enforcement, NOT AC-driven
Structural_Subagent_Conditionality:

    "❌ FEEDBACK CHECK FAIL: Handoff marked feedback_required: true but no feedback
    was collected. Gate 4 BLOCKED. Either: (a) collect feedback, or (b) explicitly approve skip."

  escape_valve: |
    Human can always say "skip feedback for this handoff" — record the approval in
    Gate 4 report as "Feedback skipped: human approved at [timestamp]" and proceed.
    The blocking check prevents SILENT skipping, not intentional skipping.

  ### Gate 4 Result

  #### Prerequisite
  | Check | Status |
  |-------|--------|
  | Gate 3 Passed | ✅ Yes |
  | Gate 3 Evidence | ✅ Exists (§9.1-driven result for code/mixed, or rubric-eval verdict: PASS) |

  #### Quality Evidence (BLOCKING)
  | Evidence Type | Required | Exists | File | Status |
  |---------------|----------|--------|------|--------|
  | Code review | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | {file} | ✅ |
  | Security review | code/mixed | ✅ Yes | {file} | ✅ |
  | Performance review | code/mixed | ✅ Yes | {file} | ✅ |
  | UX review | if UI | ... | ... | ... |

  #### Acceptance Checks
  | Item | Status | Note |
  |------|--------|------|
  | Functional acceptance | ✅ Pass | §9 AC met, no open blockers |
  | Quality evidence complete | ✅ Pass | All required evidence exists |
  | Subagent issues resolved | ✅ Pass | All P0/P1 addressed |
  | Knowledge Assessment | ✅ Pass | ... |

  #### Knowledge Assessment (MANDATORY - must answer)
  | Question | Answer | Evidence |
  |----------|--------|----------|
  | New discoveries? | ✅ Yes / ❌ No | — |
  | If Yes: written to | .tad/project-knowledge/{category}.md | Entry title: "### {title} - {date}" |
  | If No: reason | {why no new discovery} | — |

  ⚠️ Alex writes business/architecture discoveries. Blake writes implementation discoveries.
  No overlap: Blake owns Gate 3 knowledge, Alex owns Gate 4 knowledge.
  Tiebreaker: HOW code works (tool quirks, build issues, API gotchas) → Blake Gate 3.
             WHY a design should change (architecture patterns, requirement gaps) → Alex Gate 4.

## ⚠️ Gate 4 Subagent Requirement (CRITICAL)
Alex 必须调用 subagents 进行实际验收，不可仅做纸面验收：

Required Subagents (MANDATORY - Gate will BLOCK without these):
  - security-auditor → Evidence in .tad/evidence/reviews/
  - performance-optimizer → Evidence in .tad/evidence/reviews/
  - code-reviewer (ALWAYS required)

Conditional Subagents:
  - ux-expert-reviewer (if UI involved)

Workflow:
  1. Blake completes Gate 3, creates completion report + testing evidence
  2. Blake calls security-auditor → saves security-review evidence
  3. Blake calls performance-optimizer → saves performance-review evidence
  4. Alex reads completion report and evidence files
  5. Alex calls code-reviewer (and ux-expert if UI involved)
  6. Alex summarizes all subagent feedback
  7. Alex decides: PASS / CONDITIONAL PASS / REJECT
  8. If PASS: Gate 4 complete, deliver to user
