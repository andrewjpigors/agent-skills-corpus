# Get Perspective On

Extract the user's unique perspective on a topic from the knowledge base. Returns brief, focused insights (not full article). Can be called directly by user or via content agent in headless mode.

## Usage

```
/get-perspective-on <topic or question>
```

## Parameters

- **topic or question**: What perspective to retrieve
  - Specific topic
  - Question format
  - Comparison
  - Application

## Examples

```
/get-perspective-on AI agent adoption barriers
/get-perspective-on Why do companies resist AI?
/get-perspective-on How dopamine relates to social media
/get-perspective-on What's contrarian about my AI views?
```

## Workflow

1. **Search Knowledge Base**
   - Use /recall or Local Brain Search
   - Find 3-5 most relevant permanent notes
   - Look for contrarian or non-obvious angles

2. **Synthesize Perspective**
   - Brief format (1-3 paragraphs)
   - Focus on unique angles
   - Cite specific permanent notes
   - Include "why this matters"

3. **Return Response**
   - For direct user: Display perspective with citations
   - For a content agent headless: Return text for content use

## Output Format

```
🧠 the user's Perspective: [Topic]

[1-3 paragraphs synthesizing unique insights from permanent notes]

Key insights:
- [Insight 1 from [[Note A]]]
- [Insight 2 from [[Note B]]]
- [Insight 3 connecting [[Note C]] and [[Note D]]]

Why this matters:
[Brief explanation of significance or application]

📝 Cited Notes:
- [[Note Title 1]]
- [[Note Title 2]]
- [[Note Title 3]]
```

## Integration with a content agent

When a content agent calls via headless mode:
```bash
cd $PROJECT_ROOT
claude -p "/get-perspective-on 'AI adoption barriers'" --output-format json
```

a content agent receives:
```json
{
  "result": "[Perspective text with citations]",
  "total_cost_usd": 0.34
}
```

## Quality Criteria

Good perspective:
✅ Cites 3-5 specific permanent notes
✅ Highlights contrarian or non-obvious angles
✅ Connects to broader themes
✅ Includes concrete examples
✅ Authentic your voice

Weak perspective (regenerate):
❌ Generic AI knowledge
❌ No specific note citations
❌ Surface-level analysis
❌ Lacks unique angles

## Use Cases

- Quick content ideas for social posts
- Video script foundations
- Article brainstorming
- Perspective validation
- Connection discovery

## Notes

- Keep brief (1-3 paragraphs)
- Focus on what's unique to the user's thinking
- Always cite permanent notes
- Emphasize non-obvious connections
- Cost: ~$0.30-0.40 per call
