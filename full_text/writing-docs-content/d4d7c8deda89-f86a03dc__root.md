# /root — Development Workflow Session Init

Entry point for the Root development workflow framework. Provides tier-based planning, doc-aware context gathering, and session tracking.

## Configuration

Root reads project-specific settings from `root.config.json` in the project root. If the config file doesn't exist, use sensible defaults:
- `docsDir`: `"docs"`
- `plansDir`: `"docs/plans"`
- `prdsDir`: `"docs/prds"`
- Mappings: empty (skip Step 5 recommendations)

## Protocol

Execute all steps in order. Steps 1-7 run autonomously. Step 8 drives planning (tier-dependent). Step 9 generates tasks after plan approval.

> **CARDINAL UNDER `--auto`**: when CI on a PR you opened goes green, the next action is `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` — NOT a status report and NOT a confirmation prompt. Asking the user to type "merge" or "yes" is a protocol violation. The full `--auto` contract is defined in Step 0's "--auto flag behavior" table below; this is the one-line summary you must internalize before reading anything else.

### Anti-pattern — the deferential prior

The training distribution's default template is "report status, wait for human." Under `--auto` that template is wrong. Three concrete failure modes:

**(a) PR merge after green CI**
BAD: "PR #164 opened with the docs cleanup. All CI checks pass. Let me know when you'd like to merge."
GOOD: "Merged #164 at abc123. Main current."

**(b) Follow-on fix folded into the active PR**
BAD: "I noticed a small type error in the adjacent file. I've included the fix in this PR — let me know if you'd prefer it as a separate issue."
GOOD: "Opened #165 for the type error in foo.ts. Keeping it out of this PR."

**(c) End-of-run status report**
BAD: "All three PRs are open and CI is green on each. Ready to merge when you give the word."
GOOD: "Merged #159, #160, #164. All squash-merged and branches deleted. Main is current."

Under `--auto`, the user authorized merge and forward decisions at session start. The model is not asking — it is reporting outcomes.

### Step 0: Dispatch

`/root` is both the task entry point AND the orchestration driver. Re-running `/root #<issue>` is the universal "continue" gesture — every invocation inspects stream state and advances to the next actionable phase.

Parse the first token of the argument.

**Flag extraction.** Before matching verbs or issue numbers, scan the argument for these flags and remove them from the token stream:
- `--auto` — set the `autoApprove` flag. Effect depends on entry path (see below).
- `--batch` — explicit batch-mode signal. Required when the argument contains 2+ issue numbers; rejected with one issue. Forces `--auto` (batch without auto is meaningless).
- `--groups A,B` — limit execution to specific groups (passed through to `/root:impl`).

**Multi-issue invocation.** Count issue numbers in the argument. If 2+:
- Without `--batch`: reject — "Multiple issue numbers require `--batch`. Did you mean `/root #x #y #z --auto --batch`?"
- With `--batch` but without `--auto`: implicitly add `--auto`, surface a one-line note ("`--batch` implies `--auto`").
- With both: proceed to **Autonomous Multi-Issue Mode** (below) instead of phase-aware dispatch.

**Single-issue + `--auto`.** Single issue with `--auto` runs the readiness gate (below) before falling through to phase-aware dispatch. This is the existing single-issue autonomous path with the new gate in front.

**Reserved orchestration verbs** — if the first token matches one of these, dispatch and stop (no session init):

| Verb | Action |
|------|--------|
| `reset` | Call `board_clean`. Output "Root streams cleared." Stop. Ignore any issue number in the argument. |
| `list` | Call `board_list`. Output result. Stop. |
| `status [#issue]` | If issue given, call `board_status`; else `board_list`. Stop. |
| `sync` | Call `board_sync`. Output result. Stop. Ignore any issue number. |
| `delete <#issue>` | Requires an issue. Call `board_delete` with issue. Output result. Stop. If no issue is present, reject: "delete requires an issue number." |
| `clean` | Call `board_clean`. Output result. Stop. Ignore any issue number. |
| `approve <#issue>` | Requires an issue. Call `board_approve` with issue. Then fall through to phase-aware dispatch below for that issue (approval means "go"). If no issue is present, reject: "approve requires an issue number." |
| `run [#issue] [--groups A,B]` | If no issue and exactly one active stream exists, use it. If multiple, call `board_list` and ask which. Call `board_sync` first. Then fall through to phase-aware dispatch below. |

**Verb + issue normalization.** When a verb is matched AND an issue number also appears anywhere in the argument, use the issue as the verb's target — regardless of position. This handles natural-language variants like `/root list #1234` (treat as `status #1234` — the user clearly meant that one stream, not the whole list), `/root approve 1234`, `/root delete #42`. If the verb is one that ignores issues (`reset`, `sync`, `clean`), discard the issue with no error.

**Otherwise** — extract an issue number from the argument (formats: `#1234`, `1234`, `issue 1234`, `GH-1234`, `github.com/.../issues/1234`).

If no issue number is found, reject:

> "Root work is issue-anchored. Either pass an issue number (`/root #1234 <description>`) or file one first with `gh issue create`."

Stop.

**Phase-aware dispatch** (we now have an issue number):

1. Call `board_status` with the issue number.
2. If a stream record exists (any status), call `board_reconcile` with the issue number **before routing**. If `board_reconcile` returns `{ "reconciled": true }`, the stream was in a terminal GitHub state (PR merged or issue closed out-of-band). Output: "Stream #<issue> reconciled — <reason>. Record removed." Stop. Do not proceed to any planning or implementation steps.
3. Route based on the stream's status:

| Stream status | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| no stream | Proceed to Step 1 (fresh session init). |
| `queued` / `planning` | Proceed to Step 1 (resume planning). |
| `plan-ready` | Read `planPath` from the stream record. Output: "Plan at `<planPath>` awaiting approval. Re-run `/root #<issue>` after approving, or `/root approve #<issue>` to green-light now." Stop. |
| `approved` / `implementing` / `validating` / `pr-ready` | Dispatch `/root:impl #<issue>` (no subcommand — `/root:impl` phase-detects from `board_status` and starts at the correct step: Step 1 for `approved`/`implementing`, Step 8 for `validating`, Step 10c for `pr-ready`). Pass `--groups` if specified. After it returns, call `board_run` to advance state. If the new state is actionable (not `plan-ready` or terminal), re-evaluate this step. |
| terminal (`merged`, etc.) | Output: "Stream #<issue> is complete (`<status>`)." Stop. |

Only the "no stream" and "planning" branches fall through to Steps 1-8 below. All other actionable branches dispatch to `/root:impl` and loop on re-evaluation until the stream reaches a human gate (`plan-ready`) or terminal state (`merged`).

**`pr-ready` is not terminal.** A stream reaches `pr-ready` when the PR exists but CI may still be pending, review comments may be unresolved, and the merge hasn't happened. Re-invoking `/root #<issue>` drives the stream through Step 10c (CI poll), Step 10d (review resolution), and Step 10e (merge) until it reaches `merged`.

**`--auto` flag behavior** (when extracted above):

| Entry path | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| No stream exists (fresh creation) | Pass `autoApprove: true` to `board_start` in Step 6. All gates (including Tier 1 `plan_approval`) auto-advance for this stream. |
| Stream exists, status `plan-ready` | Treat as equivalent to `approve` — call `board_approve` with the issue, then fall through to phase-aware dispatch. |
| Stream exists, any other status | `--auto` is a no-op and a warning: "Stream #<issue> already exists with `autoApprove: <value>`. `--auto` only takes effect at stream creation. To green-light a specific gate, use `/root approve #<issue>`." Continue with phase-aware dispatch regardless. |
| Orchestrator behavior throughout the run | Under `--auto`, the orchestrator MUST NOT call `AskUserQuestion` and MUST NOT park the run for human approval at any step Root controls (`plan_approval`, draft-PR review, post-CI review, run-completion confirmation). The only stops permitted are: (a) readiness-gate interview where context cannot resolve a concern, (b) genuinely irrecoverable failure, (c) external gates Root does not control (branch protection, required reviews, red CI). `--auto` is permission to make defensible defaults and ship. |

The MCP enforces this honestly: `board_run` at `mcp/mcp-root-board/src/index.ts:337` skips gate evaluation entirely when `stream.autoApprove === true`, including Tier 1 `plan_approval`. There is no "`--auto` does not override plan_approval" rule — if you see a message claiming that, the stream's `autoApprove` is `false`.

### Step 1: Parse the argument

The issue number was already extracted in Step 0 (this branch is only reached when an issue number is present). Now extract:
- **Task description** — the remaining argument text after removing the issue number and any leading reserved verb. This is in-the-moment context/color that augments the issue body.

### Step 2: Fetch issue context (if issue number found)

Run:
```bash
gh issue view <number> --json number,title,body,labels,state,assignees
```

Store the result. The issue title, body, and labels inform tier classification and doc matching.

### Step 2.5: Triage-status confirmation gate

Only runs on **fresh stream creation** (Step 0 routed via the "no stream" branch). Skip if the stream already exists.

If the issue's labels include `status:roadmap` or `status:backlog`, stop and confirm before continuing:

- `status:roadmap` — on the immediate roadmap but not necessarily the next thing to pull.
- `status:backlog` — has merit but is not prioritized for work.

Both are signals that picking this up now may not be intentional. Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm:

> "Issue #<number> is labeled `<status:roadmap|status:backlog>`. Do you want to start work on it now?"

- If the user declines, stop. Do not call `board_start`.
- If the user confirms, continue to Step 3.
- If `--auto` was extracted in Step 0, skip this gate — passing `--auto` on a roadmap/backlog issue is explicit pre-approval.

### Step 3: Extract tier override (if any)

Tier classification is owned by the MCP. `board_start` inspects the issue's labels, title, and body via `classifyTier` (`mcp/mcp-root-board/src/classify.ts`) and writes a definite tier to the stream record. You do **not** classify tier yourself here.

| Tier | Criteria (used by `classifyTier`) |
|------|----------|
| **Tier 1** (Full Process) | `type:refactor`/`type:epic`/`type:security` labels, or Tier 1 keywords (refactor, migration, rewrite, schema change, architecture) in title/body. (`type:feature` is **not** a Tier 1 signal — triage over-applies it; feature issues classify by keywords.) |
| **Tier 2** (Light Process) | `type:bug`/`type:chore`/`type:docs`/`type:dependencies` labels, or Tier 2 keywords (fix, typo, bump, patch, hotfix, update dep). Also the policy for ambiguous cases. |

**Scope-signal downgrade (automatic).** After the classifier resolves Tier 1, `classifyTier` runs a secondary `scopeSignal` check. When ALL THREE of the following hold simultaneously, the result is quietly downgraded to Tier 2:

- **small** — ≤3 distinct file paths referenced in the issue body (from a `## Files affected` section if present, otherwise the full body).
- **locked** — the body contains a `## Acceptance criteria`, `## Acceptance`, or `## Done when` heading with ≥2 bullet lines beneath it.
- **mechanical** — the issue title or the first paragraph (before the first `##` heading) contains a mechanical keyword (`rename`, `signature`, `single-file`, `one-line`, `typo`, `bump`, `extract`, `inline`, `move`, `split`, `merge`), OR a `## Fix:` / `## Fix path:` section names a specific function or code location.

When the downgrade fires, `board_start`'s `Tier:` response line reads:
```
Tier: tier2 (classifier: Tier downgraded by scope signal (small (N files) + locked (AC/done-when) + mechanical (keyword: X)); original label/keyword classification was tier1)
```
Surface this reason to the user in the Step 7 summary so the downgrade is visible.

User-supplied tier overrides short-circuit before `classifyTier` is called, so this downgrade **never fires when the user explicitly passes a tier**.

Your job in this step: extract an explicit user override from the argument, if one was given.

- If the user said "tier 1" / "full process" / "--tier 1" → pass `tier: "tier1"` AND `tierJustification: "<exact phrase the user used>"` to `board_start` in Step 6.
- If the user said "tier 2" / "quick fix" / "--tier 2" → pass `tier: "tier2"` AND `tierJustification: "<exact phrase the user used>"`.
- Otherwise pass no `tier` argument and let `classifyTier` decide. Do **not** invent a justification just to override the classifier — `board_start` will reject blank/whitespace `tierJustification` values, and the failure mode (a Tier 1 stream you mentally treat as Tier 2) is worse than letting the classifier decide.

`board_start`'s response line (`Tier: tierX (reason)`) reports the classification and why. Surface the reason to the user in the Step 7 summary.

### Step 4: Load relevant docs

1. Query the RAG database for relevant documentation:
   ```bash
   RAG_BIN="${HOME}/.root-framework/mcp/node_modules/mcp-local-rag/dist/index.js"
   DB_PATH=$(python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('root.config.json')).get('ingest', {}).get('dbPath', '.root/rag-db'))" 2>/dev/null || echo ".root/rag-db")
   CACHE_DIR="${HOME}/.cache/mcp-local-rag/models"
   node "$RAG_BIN" --db-path "$DB_PATH" --cache-dir "$CACHE_DIR" query "<query from task description + issue title/body>"
   ```
   - Use `limit: 10` to get a broad set of results
   - Filter results: use chunks with score < 0.3 directly, consider 0.3-0.5 if relevant, skip > 0.5
2. From the query results, identify the top 1-3 most relevant **unique documents** (by filePath)
3. Read those docs using the Read tool for full context
4. If no results score below 0.5, that's fine — not every task needs background docs
5. **Fallback**: If the RAG server is unavailable, fall back to matching by keyword

### Step 5: Recommend skills and agents

Read `root.config.json` and match against all three mapping types:

#### Doc path matching
For each doc loaded in Step 4, check its path against `docMappings[].pattern` (regex match). Collect matching `agents` and `skills`.

#### Issue label matching
For each label on the issue, check against `labelMappings[].label`. Collect matching `agents`.

#### Task keyword matching
For each entry in `keywordMappings`, check if any `keywords` appear in the task description or issue title/body. Collect matching `agents`.

#### Rules
- Deduplicate: if multiple signals point to the same agent/skill, list it once
- Limit to 1-3 skills and 1-3 agents — only the most relevant
- If no signals match (or no config), omit the section

### Step 6: Initialize session state

Call `board_start` MCP tool with the issue number. If `--auto` was extracted in Step 0 AND this is a fresh stream (no prior stream existed), pass `autoApprove: true` as well — this sets the stream to fully autonomous so all gates (including Tier 1 `plan_approval`) auto-advance. If a tier override was extracted in Step 3, pass `tier: "tier1"` or `tier: "tier2"` accordingly **and** pass `tierJustification` quoting the user's actual words; otherwise omit both and the MCP will classify from issue data. `board_start` rejects an override with a blank `tierJustification`.

> **Warning:** `board_start` **without a `groupId`** is destructive on existing streams — it calls `createStream` which overwrites. Step 0's phase-aware dispatch ensures we only reach Step 6 when no stream exists (the "no stream" branch), so this is safe in practice. (A `board_start` call *with* a `groupId` on an existing stream is the non-destructive group-worktree path used by the Tier 1 workflow — it never recreates the stream.)

Then call `board_run` to advance the status from `queued` to `planning`.

The board stream at `.root/board/<issue>.json` is the sole source of truth for session state. Do NOT write `/tmp/root-session.json`.

### Step 7: Output kickoff summary

Print a structured summary. Example for Tier 2:

```
## Root Session Initialized

**Tier**: 2 (Light Process) — [brief reason]
**Issue**: #1132 — Fix auth token refresh loop
**Stream**: #1132 (planning)
**Labels**: area:backend, type:bug
**State**: OPEN

### Docs Loaded
- `docs/AUTH_SYSTEM.md` — Authentication System

### Recommended Agents
- **Agent**: `specialist-backend` — area:backend label, auth-related docs

### Workflow (Tier 2)
1. Understand → Read the relevant code, trace the issue
2. Fix → Make the change
3. Validate → lint + type-check + relevant tests
4. Commit → Conventional commit format

### Next Step
- **Autonomous**: Re-run `/root #1132` — it will pick up from the current phase and drive through to PR-ready.
- **Manual**: Make the change, validate, and commit.
```

Example for Tier 1:

```
## Root Session Initialized

**Tier**: 1 (Full Process) — [brief reason]
**Issue**: #1200 — New weather integration
**Stream**: #1200 (planning)
**Labels**: area:backend, type:feature

### Docs Loaded
- `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md` — Integration Architecture

### Recommended Agents
- **Agent**: `specialist-backend` — area:backend, integration-related docs

### Workflow (Tier 1)
1. PRD → Write in <prdsDir>
2. Implementation Plan → Delegated to `team-architect` (writes plan, traces code)
3. Review → Plan mode for human approval
4. Implement → Delegated to `team-implementer` per Execution Group (parallel worktrees)
5. Test → Delegated to `team-tester` (per group)
6. Review → Delegated to `team-reviewer` before commit
7. Validate → Full quality gate
8. Document → Update relevant docs
9. Commit → Zero errors, conventional format

### Next Step — MANDATORY
Tier 1 work MUST run through the agent team. Your next action is:
- **Autonomous**: Re-run `/root #<issue>` after plan approval — it will auto-progress through all remaining phases.
- **Manual**: Run `/root:prd new` then spawn `team-architect`, then `/root:impl`.
```


After outputting the summary, proceed to Step 8.

### Step 8: Drive planning phase

Planning is tier-dependent. Execute the appropriate path below.

Read `root.config.json` to get `project.plansDir` and `project.prdsDir`.

#### Tier 1 path: Implementation Plan

**Delegation is mandatory.** The main thread does not write the Implementation Plan or trace code paths — it coordinates the team. Follow this sequence exactly.

1. **Check for PRD**: Look for a PRD in `<prdsDir>` that matches the issue or task slug. Three branches:

   **Branch A — PRD file exists**: Use that file as the PRD input for step 2. Continue.

   **Branch B — No PRD file; issue body qualifies (`isIssueBodyPRDEquivalent` → true)**:
   `isIssueBodyPRDEquivalent` returns true when the issue body contains ALL THREE of:
   - A problem statement or motivation section (describes *why* the change is needed)
   - A scoped fix path or technical approach (describes *what* will change and *how*)
   - Acceptance criteria — an explicit `## Acceptance criteria` heading, or a clearly-marked equivalent such as a bulleted "Acceptance", "Done when", or "Definition of done" section

   If all three are present, skip `/root:prd new` entirely. Tell the user one line:
   > "Issue body satisfies PRD requirements (problem + approach + acceptance criteria). Skipping `/root:prd new`; passing issue body to `team-architect`."

   Use the issue body verbatim as the PRD input for step 2. No interview. No file written.

   **Branch C — No PRD file; issue body does NOT qualify (`isIssueBodyPRDEquivalent` → false)**:
   - **When `--auto` is NOT set**: tell the user:
     > "Tier 1 requires a PRD before the implementation plan. Starting guided PRD authoring."
     Run `/root:prd new <task description or issue number>` to guide the user through PRD creation. After the PRD is written, continue to step 2. Do not stop or ask the user to re-run `/root`.
   - **When `--auto` IS set**: do NOT call `/root:prd new` — it invokes `AskUserQuestion` during its Phase 2 interview, which is a protocol violation under `--auto`. Instead, tell the user one line:
     > "Under `--auto`, the issue body is incomplete but Root must not interview. Passing issue body to `team-architect` with instruction to scope independently."
     Use the issue body as the PRD input for step 2, and include in the architect prompt an explicit note that the issue body is underspecified and the architect should produce its own scoping in the Implementation Plan.

2. **Spawn `team-architect`**: Use the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "team-architect"` and a prompt that:
   - Points the architect at the PRD input — either the PRD file path (Branch A) or the issue body text (Branches B and C)
   - Points at `<plansDir>/TEMPLATE.md` as the required format
   - Points at `root.config.json` for coding standards and validation commands
   - Lists the agent recommendations from Step 5 as suggested Execution Group owners
   - Instructs the architect to: trace code paths (it may spawn its own Explore sub-agents), populate the full Implementation Plan (Requirements Traceability, Change Manifest, Dependency Graph, Execution Groups, Coding Standards Compliance, Risk Register, Verification Plan), write it to `<plansDir>/<slug>.md`, and call `ExitPlanMode` when ready for approval

   **Do NOT trace code paths or draft the plan in the main thread.** The architect owns this work end-to-end. Wait for it to return before proceeding.

3. **Update session state**: After the architect returns with the plan file path, call `board_run` with the issue number to evaluate the plan gate:
   - If `board_run` returns `{ "status": "ready" }` (auto gate), the stream advances automatically toward `approved`.
   - If `board_run` returns `{ "status": "blocked" }` (human gate), the stream pauses at `plan-ready` awaiting human approval via `board_approve` or the `root:approved` GitHub label.

4. **Ingest the plan into RAG**:
   ```bash
   node "$RAG_BIN" --db-path "$DB_PATH" --cache-dir "$CACHE_DIR" ingest <plan-path>
   ```

5. **Relay plan mode to user**: The architect already called `ExitPlanMode`. Surface the plan to the user for review:
   > "Implementation plan written to `<plansDir>/<slug>.md` by `team-architect`. Review and approve to proceed to `/root:impl`."

#### Tier 2 path: Ephemeral plan via built-in plan mode

1. **Enter plan mode**: Use `EnterPlanMode` to create an ephemeral plan in `.claude/plans/` (or `.gemini/plans/` if using Gemini CLI).

2. **Write a lightweight plan** covering:
   - Files to change and what changes in each (code-section level)
   - Verification commands from `root.config.json` → `validation`
   - No persistent artifact needed — the commit message and PR description serve as source of record

3. **Record the plan path — MANDATORY verification before proceeding**: After `EnterPlanMode` returns, the harness provides the plan file path (e.g. `.claude/plans/<slug>.md`).

   a. **Verify the path exists on disk.** Use the Read tool or `test -f <path>` to confirm the file is present and readable. If the path is missing, empty, or unreadable, halt with:
      > "Tier 2 plan path could not be resolved (EnterPlanMode returned no usable path). The stream will stay at `planning` until this is fixed. Investigate the harness return value before continuing."
      Do NOT call `board_set_plan_path`.

   b. **Call `board_set_plan_path`** with the issue number and the verified path. If `board_set_plan_path` returns an error, halt with:
      > "`board_set_plan_path` returned an error: `<error>`. The plan path was not persisted. The stream will stay at `planning`. Resolve the MCP error before continuing."
      Do NOT call `board_run`.

   c. **Check resulting stream status.** Call `board_status` with the issue number. If the status is not `plan-ready`, halt with:
      > "`board_set_plan_path` did not advance the stream to `plan-ready`. Current status: `<status>`. Halting."
      Do NOT call `board_run`.

4. **Update session state** (only reached if step 3's checks all passed): Call `board_run` with the issue number. For Tier 2 the `plan_approval` gate defaults to `auto`, so the stream will advance automatically.

The plan is ready when the user approves it via plan mode. GitHub issue/PR linkage provides traceability.

### Step 9: Hand off to implementation (after plan approval)

After the user approves the plan (exits plan mode), hand off to `/root:impl`:

> "Implementation Plan approved.
> - **Autonomous**: Re-run `/root #<issue>` — it will dispatch `/root:impl` and drive the stream to PR-ready.
> - **Manual**: Run `/root:impl` to execute step by step, or `/root:impl status` to review the plan."

The plan file is the source of truth — `/root:impl` reads the Change Manifest and Execution Groups directly. No intermediate task list is needed.

## Autonomous Multi-Issue Mode

Triggered by `/root #<epic> --auto` (epic mode) or `/root #x #y #z --auto --batch` (batch mode). Both share the same orchestration spine; they differ only in how children are resolved.

### Orchestration spine

The orchestrator runs in this main harness conversation. Each child issue is dispatched as a `Agent` tool subagent with `isolation: worktree` so per-child execution does NOT consume the orchestrator's context. The orchestrator's only jobs are: readiness gating, sequencing, shared-context curation, PR assembly, and notification.

**Critical context-window discipline.** Everything load-bearing for resuming the run after auto-compaction must be on disk in the shared-context file, not in the conversation. This includes: which children have completed, which is currently running, the running child's worktree path, the partial PR URL once opened, and any architectural decisions a future child needs. Treat the conversation as scratch space; treat shared-context as the durable state.

### Step A0: Readiness gate (mandatory in autonomous mode)

Before creating any stream:

1. For epic mode: collect the epic issue number plus its children (via `gh api graphql` sub-issues query, same shape as `getSubIssues`).
   For batch mode: the explicit list from the argument.
2. For each issue (epic + every child, or every batch member), spawn the `issue-readiness-grader` agent. Pass the issue number; the agent reads the body via `gh issue view` and returns strict JSON.
3. Collect verdicts. If any return `needs-clarification`, **enter the interview loop** (next step). Do NOT skip, do NOT offer a `--force` flag, do NOT bypass.
4. Only when every issue grades `ready` does the orchestrator proceed to Step A1.

### Step A1: Interview loop (entered on any `needs-clarification`)

Round budget: **3 grading rounds total**. Round 4 is a hard stop.

Per round:

1. Aggregate concerns and questions across all issues that failed. Print a concise per-issue panel:
   ```
   #<n>: <title>
     Concerns: <list of short concern identifiers>
     Questions:
       1. <question>
       2. <question>
   ```
2. Ask the user. Use `AskUserQuestion` for the answers — one block per issue, with a free-form text input. Allow the user to type `abort` at any prompt to cancel the run; allow `skip <n>` to drop a specific child from the run (epic mode only — batch members are explicit, dropping one is the user's call to re-invoke).
3. For each issue with answers, append a `## Clarifications (added by /root readiness gate, <ISO-timestamp>)` section to the issue body via `gh issue edit <n> --body "<full new body>"`. Quote each question and the user's answer underneath.
4. Re-grade every issue that just received clarifications.
5. If all issues now grade `ready`, exit the loop and proceed to Step A2.
6. If the round counter is at 3 and any issue still grades `needs-clarification`, hard-stop with: "After 3 rounds the readiness gate is still failing. Either the rubric is wrong or the issue needs hand-revision before Root can take it. Concerns remaining: <list>." Do not create any stream.

### Step A2: Create parent stream

Call `board_epic_start({ epicIssue, mode, children })`:
- `mode: "epic"` — `children` argument omitted; the MCP resolves via sub-issues.
- `mode: "batch"` — `children` array is the explicit list from the argument.

The parent stream's branch is `feat/epic-<n>-<slug>` or `chore/batch-<n>-<slug>`. Create the worktree at this branch (use the same `createWorktree` machinery `board_start` uses; reuse via the parent's recorded `branch`).

Append a kickoff note to shared-context:
```
board_shared_append({
  epicIssue: <n>,
  note: "Run started. Mode: <epic|batch>. Children in order: <list>. Branch: <epicBranch>."
})
```

### Step A3: Per-child dispatch loop

For each child in declared order:

1. **Tier check.** Call `board_status` on the child if a stream already exists; otherwise pre-classify via `gh issue view` + the same heuristics `classifyTier` uses. In **batch mode**, any tier-1 child triggers a hard stop (`sendDiscord('blocker', ...)`) — batch is for tier-2 sweeps only. In **epic mode**, tier-1 children are allowed but their `plan_approval` gate will pause the run; the parent's `autoApprove` does NOT cascade to children automatically (per-child `autoApprove` is set in the next step).

2. **Read shared-context.** Call `board_shared_get({ epicIssue: <parent> })`. Pass the contents into the subagent prompt so the child has the same orientation as everyone before it.

3. **Spawn subagent.** Use the `Agent` tool with `isolation: worktree`, `subagent_type: team-implementer` (or a more specific specialist if `root.config.json` mappings suggest one), and a prompt that:
   - Tells the child what issue it owns (`#<n>`)
   - Includes the full shared-context
   - Tells the child to commit DIRECTLY onto the parent's `epicBranch` (not a per-child branch) and to stop after committing — no PR creation per child
   - Tells the child to emit a structured "Result" block at the end: commits made, files touched, deviations from the issue body, target metrics
   - Sets `autoApprove: true` for the child stream so its own gates don't pause the run

4. **Collect result.** Wait for subagent return. Parse the Result block.

5. **Append summary to shared-context.** One concise entry per child: issue number, commit SHAs, files touched, deviations, target metrics. This is what protects against auto-compact — the orchestrator may forget what the child did, but the file remembers.

6. **Update / open PR.** On first completed child: open the PR — as **ready-for-review** when `--auto` is set, or as **draft** otherwise. On every subsequent child: `gh pr edit` to refresh the body, adding the new `Closes #<n>` line and the new check entry. PR title:
   - Epic: `<epic-title> (epic #<epic-num>)`
   - Batch: `chore: batch fixes (#x, #y, #z)`
   PR body sketch:
   ```
   Autonomous <epic|batch> run.

   - [x] #101 — <title> (sha: abc123)
   - [x] #102 — <title> (sha: def456)
   - [ ] #103 — pending

   Closes #101
   Closes #102
   ```
   Under `--auto`, the create → watch → merge sequence for a single child is one atomic step from the orchestrator's perspective:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --base main --head <epicBranch> --title "<title>" --body "<body>" \
     && gh pr checks <pr-num> --watch \
     && gh pr merge <pr-num> --squash --delete-branch
   ```
   Do not surface CI status updates to the user between `gh pr create` and `gh pr merge` — those are internal progress states, not user-facing checkpoints. Under `--draft` (non-`--auto`), skip the watch and merge commands; the PR stays draft until the user flips it.

7. **Project sync per child.** `board_start` already sets the child's Project Status to `In Progress` (issue #8). The native PR-linked workflow will move each `Closes #<n>` issue to `Review` once the PR is opened.

8. **On child failure or hard-stop.** Stop dispatching further children. Fire `sendDiscord('blocker', ...)` with the failed issue number and reason. Update the PR body with a `⚠ Partial completion` callout above the checklist. PR stays draft. Update parent stream status to `epic-blocked` or `epic-partial`. Append a concluding note to shared-context.

### Step A4: Run completion

When all children complete successfully:

1. Append final note to shared-context summarizing the run.
2. Update parent stream status to `epic-complete`.
3. Fire `sendDiscord('epic_complete', ...)` with the PR URL.

**If `--auto` is set** (autonomous completion path):

Execute the following as a single chained operation. Do not return to the user between steps:

```bash
gh pr checks <pr-num> --watch \
  && gh pr merge <pr-num> --squash --delete-branch \
  && git worktree remove <worktree-path> --force
```

Then call `board_delete({ issue: <epic-or-batch-num> })` to remove the parent stream, and print a concise summary: which children landed (issue numbers + titles), the merge SHA, and a one-line note on what shipped.

This is one operation. Do not return to the user between `gh pr create` and `gh pr merge` — CI status updates are not user-facing checkpoints. Returning to the user after opening the PR but before merging it is a protocol violation under `--auto`.

**If CI is red, branch protection blocks the merge, or a merge conflict exists** (regardless of `--auto`): park at `pr-ready`, fire `sendDiscord('blocker', ...)` describing the external gate, and surface the blocker to the user. `--auto` does not bypass branch-protection rules or required reviews — it removes only the human gates Root itself imposes.

**If `--auto` is NOT set** (non-autonomous path):

4. PR stays draft until the user explicitly flips it to ready (deliberate — gives the user a final chance to scan the assembled diff before review starts). Print: "Epic #<n> complete. PR #<pr-num> is ready for review (currently draft). Flip to ready with `gh pr ready <pr-num>` when satisfied."

### Auto-compact resilience

Re-invoking `/root #<epic> --auto` on a partially-completed epic should pick up where it left off:

1. `board_status` on the epic returns `kind: 'epic'`, `status: 'epic-running' | 'epic-blocked' | 'epic-partial'`.
2. The orchestrator loads shared-context, identifies the last completed child by scanning the file's checklist entries, and dispatches the next pending child in the declared order.
3. The PR exists; the orchestrator updates it rather than creating a new one.

This means: **never destroy shared-context mid-run.** The 32KB overflow trigger is intentional — silent truncation would defeat resumability.
