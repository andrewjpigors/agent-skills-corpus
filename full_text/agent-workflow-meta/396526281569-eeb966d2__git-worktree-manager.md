# Git Worktree Manager

## Skill Metadata

**Name:** Git Worktree Manager  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Author:** Darren Ehlers (Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc.)  
**Primary Terminals:** All iOS/Android/Firebase terminals  
**Platforms:** macOS, Linux, Windows (WSL2)  
**Last Updated:** November 2025

---

## Purpose

This skill manages Git worktrees for parallel development workflows across multiple terminal sessions. It automates worktree creation, cleanup, and status tracking to support the virtual dev team infrastructure where each terminal context works on its own branch in an isolated working directory.

Git worktrees allow checking out multiple branches simultaneously from the same repository into different directories. This eliminates branch switching overhead, prevents stash/unstash cycles, and enables true parallel development across feature work, bug fixes, refactoring, and releases.

---

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Worktree Creation
- **Context-aware creation:** Automatically names worktrees based on terminal context (feature, hotfix, refactor, release, test)
- **Branch management:** Creates new branches or checks out existing ones
- **Directory organization:** Follows consistent naming patterns
- **Validation:** Prevents duplicate worktrees and invalid configurations

### 2. Worktree Discovery
- **List all worktrees:** Shows all active worktrees with branch info
- **Find by context:** Locates worktrees by type (feature, hotfix, etc.)
- **Status checking:** Shows branch status, uncommitted changes, push/pull state
- **Path resolution:** Resolves absolute paths for easy terminal navigation

### 3. Worktree Cleanup
- **Safe removal:** Removes worktrees after validation
- **Batch cleanup:** Removes multiple stale worktrees
- **Pruning:** Cleans up administrative files for deleted worktrees
- **Backup prompts:** Warns about uncommitted changes before removal

### 4. Context Integration
- **Terminal mapping:** Associates worktrees with specific terminal contexts
- **Persona awareness:** Suggests appropriate worktree types per dev team member
- **Project detection:** Auto-detects iOS, Android, or Firebase project context

---

## Worktree Naming Conventions

### Base Directory Structure

Each project is a separate Git repository with its own worktrees organized in a `worktrees/` subdirectory:

```
/Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/
│
├── MainEventApp-iOS/                    # iOS Git repository (develop branch)
│   ├── .git/                            # Git metadata
│   ├── MainEventApp.xcodeproj           # Xcode project
│   ├── Sources/                         # Source code

│
└── MainEventApp-Functions/              # Firebase Git repository (develop branch)
    ├── .git/                            # Git metadata
    ├── functions/                       # Cloud Functions source
    ├── firebase.json                    # Firebase config
    ├── README_DEV.md                    # Release documentation
    └── worktrees/                       # Firebase worktrees subdirectory
        ├── feature/                     # Feature worktree
        ├── hotfix/                      # Hotfix worktree
        ├── refactor/                    # Refactor worktree
        ├── release/                     # Release worktree
        └── test/                        # Test worktree
```

**Key Structure Notes:**
- Each project has its own independent Git repository
- Worktrees are stored in `[project-root]/worktrees/` subdirectory
- Worktree names are simple: `feature`, `hotfix`, `refactor`, `release`, `test`
- For multiple worktrees of same type, use descriptive names: `feature-funcard`, `hotfix-crash-3455`

### Naming Pattern

**Format:** `[context]` or `[context]-[descriptor]`

Since worktrees are stored within each project's `worktrees/` subdirectory, the names are simpler and don't need project prefixes.

**Basic Context Names:**
- `feature` - General feature development
- `hotfix` - Critical bug fixes
- `bugfix` - Non-critical bug fixes
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `release` - Release preparation
- `test` - Experimental/testing
- `review` - Code review

**With Descriptors (for multiple worktrees of same type):**
- `feature-funcard-reload` - Specific feature
- `feature-MEM-445-widget` - Feature with Jira ID
- `hotfix-crash-3455` - Specific hotfix
- `refactor-force-unwraps` - Specific refactoring task

**Full Path Examples:**

**iOS Project:**
```
/Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-iOS/worktrees/feature/
/Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-iOS/worktrees/feature-funcard-reload/
/Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-iOS/worktrees/hotfix/
/Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-iOS/worktrees/hotfix-crash-3455/
/Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-iOS/worktrees/refactor-force-unwraps/
```

**Android Project:**
```
/Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Android/worktrees/feature/
/Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Android/worktrees/feature-rewards-compose/
/Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Android/worktrees/hotfix/
/Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Android/worktrees/hotfix-payment-crash/
```

**Firebase Project:**
```
/Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Functions/worktrees/feature/
/Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Functions/worktrees/feature-webhook-handler/
/Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Functions/worktrees/hotfix/
/Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Functions/worktrees/refactor-query-optimization/
```

### Branch Naming Patterns

**Feature branches:** `feature/[description]` or `feature/MEM-[ID]-[description]`
- `feature/funcard-reload`
- `feature/MEM-445-home-screen-widget`

**Hotfix branches:** `hotfix/[description]` or `hotfix/crash-[ID]`
- `hotfix/booking-crash`
- `hotfix/crash-3455`

**Bugfix branches:** `bugfix/[description]` or `bugfix/MEM-[ID]`
- `bugfix/leaderboard-sort`
- `bugfix/MEM-450-reward-display`

**Refactor branches:** `refactor/[description]`
- `refactor/force-unwraps`
- `refactor/mvvm-rewards`

**Release branches:** `release/[version]`
- `release/2.9.0`
- `release/1.6.0-rc1`

## Project Detection

### Automatic Project Context Detection

The skill automatically detects which project you're working on using multiple methods:

**Detection Priority (in order):**

1. **Terminal Name Prefix**
   ```bash
   # Terminal name starts with project identifier
   ios-bridge       → iOS project (MainEventApp-iOS)
   android-sickbay  → Android project (MainEventApp-Android)
   firebase-ops     → Firebase project (MainEventApp-Functions)
   ```

2. **Current Working Directory**
   ```bash
   # If pwd contains project directory
   /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-iOS/...
   → Detected: iOS project

   /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Android/...
   → Detected: Android project

   /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Functions/...
   → Detected: Firebase project
   ```

3. **Git Remote URL**
   ```bash
   # Check git remote origin
   git remote get-url origin
   
   # If contains "MainEventApp-iOS" → iOS project
   # If contains "MainEventApp-Android" → Android project
   # If contains "MainEventApp-Functions" → Firebase project
   ```

4. **Project Files**
   ```bash
   # Check for platform-specific files
   MainEventApp.xcodeproj → iOS project
   build.gradle.kts → Android project
   firebase.json → Firebase project
   ```

5. **Explicit Override**
   ```bash
   # User can explicitly specify in command
   "Create iOS worktree for feature/funcard-reload"
   "Create Android worktree for hotfix"
   "Create Firebase worktree for refactor"
   ```

### Project Context Examples

**Scenario 1: In iOS terminal**
```
Terminal: ios-bridge
Location: /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-iOS/
Command: "Create worktree for feature"

Skill detects:
✓ Terminal prefix: ios-*
✓ Working directory: MainEventApp-iOS
✓ Project files: MainEventApp.xcodeproj found
→ Project: iOS

Creates: /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-iOS/worktrees/feature/
Branch: feature/[name]
```

**Scenario 2: In Android terminal**
```
Terminal: android-sickbay
Location: /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Android/
Command: "Create worktree for hotfix"

Skill detects:
✓ Terminal prefix: android-*
✓ Working directory: MainEventApp-Android
✓ Project files: build.gradle.kts found
→ Project: Android

Creates: /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Android/worktrees/hotfix/
Branch: hotfix/[name]
```

**Scenario 3: In Firebase terminal**
```
Terminal: firebase-ops
Location: /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Functions/
Command: "Create worktree for feature"

Skill detects:
✓ Terminal prefix: firebase-*
✓ Working directory: MainEventApp-Functions
✓ Project files: firebase.json found
→ Project: Firebase

Creates: /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Functions/worktrees/feature/
Branch: feature/[name]
```

**Scenario 4: Ambiguous context (no terminal prefix)**
```
Terminal: my-custom-terminal
Location: /some/random/path/
Command: "Create worktree for feature"

Skill responds:
⚠️  Cannot auto-detect project. Please specify:
- "Create iOS worktree for feature"
- "Create Android worktree for feature"
- "Create Firebase worktree for feature"

Or navigate to a project directory first:
- cd /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-iOS/
- cd /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Android/
- cd /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Functions/
```

### Cross-Project Work

**Can you work on multiple projects simultaneously?**
Yes! Each project has its own independent worktree structure:

```
# iOS Feature Work (in ios-bridge)
cd /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-iOS/worktrees/feature/
[Working on iOS Fun Card widget]

# Android Feature Work (in android-bridge) 
cd /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Android/worktrees/feature/
[Working on Android Fun Card widget]

# Firebase Backend Support (in firebase-ops)
cd /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Functions/worktrees/feature/
[Working on Fun Card balance sync endpoint]

All three can be in progress simultaneously!
```

### List Worktrees Across All Projects

**Command:** `"List all worktrees across all projects"`

**Output:**
```
📁 Git Worktrees - All Main Event Projects

## Trigger Phrases & Commands

### Worktree Creation

**Pattern:** `"Create worktree for [context] [optional: with branch name]"`

**Examples:**

**Simple feature worktree:**
```
# In ios-bridge terminal
"Create worktree for feature"
→ Detects iOS project from terminal name
→ Creates /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-iOS/worktrees/feature/
→ Checks out develop branch initially
→ Ready for new feature branch creation
```

**Project-specific worktree (explicit):**
```
"Create Android worktree for feature"
→ Creates /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Android/worktrees/feature/
→ Checks out develop branch
→ Ready for Android feature work
```

**Feature worktree with specific branch:**
```
# In ios-bridge terminal
"Create worktree for feature/funcard-reload"
→ Detects iOS project
→ Creates /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-iOS/worktrees/feature-funcard-reload/
→ Creates new branch: feature/funcard-reload
→ Based on current develop branch
```

**Hotfix worktree:**
```
# In android-sickbay terminal
"Create worktree for hotfix"
→ Detects Android project
→ Creates /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Android/worktrees/hotfix/
→ Checks out develop branch
→ Ready for hotfix branch creation
```

**Hotfix with specific issue:**
```
# In ios-sickbay terminal
"Create worktree for hotfix/crash-3455"
→ Detects iOS project
→ Creates /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-iOS/worktrees/hotfix-crash-3455/
→ Creates branch: hotfix/crash-3455
→ Based on develop branch
```

**Refactor worktree:**
```
# In firebase-science-lab terminal
"Create worktree for refactor/query-optimization"
→ Detects Firebase project
→ Creates /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Functions/worktrees/refactor-query-optimization/
→ Creates branch: refactor/query-optimization
→ Based on develop branch
```

**Release worktree:**
```
# In android-engineering terminal
"Create worktree for release/1.6.0"
→ Detects Android project
→ Creates /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Android/worktrees/release/
→ Creates branch: release/1.6.0
→ Based on develop branch
```

**Context-aware creation (uses current terminal and detects project):**
```
# In ios-sickbay terminal
"Create worktree for current context"
→ Detects iOS project from terminal name
→ Detects sickbay context (bug fixes)
→ Suggests hotfix worktree
→ Creates /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-iOS/worktrees/hotfix/
```

**Worktree from existing branch:**
```
# In android-bridge terminal
"Create worktree from existing branch feature/MEM-445"
→ Detects Android project
→ Creates /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Android/worktrees/feature-MEM-445/
→ Checks out existing feature/MEM-445 branch
→ No new branch created
```

### Worktree Discovery

**Pattern:** `"List worktrees"` or `"Show worktrees"` or `"What worktrees exist?"`

**Examples:**

**List all worktrees:**
```
"List all worktrees"
→ Shows all worktrees with:
  - Directory path
  - Branch name
  - Status (clean/dirty)
  - Last commit
```

**Find specific context:**
```
"Show feature worktrees"
→ Lists only feature-related worktrees
```

**Status check:**
```
"Check worktree status"
→ Shows detailed status for all worktrees:
  - Uncommitted changes
  - Unpushed commits
  - Branch ahead/behind develop
```

**Find worktree by branch:**
```
"Which worktree has branch feature/funcard-reload?"
→ Returns path to worktree with that branch
```

### Worktree Cleanup

**Pattern:** `"Remove worktree [name or context]"`

**Examples:**

**Remove by directory name:**
```
"Remove worktree main-event-hotfix-crash-3455"
→ Checks for uncommitted changes
→ Prompts for confirmation
→ Removes worktree
→ Prunes Git administrative files
```

**Remove by context:**
```
"Remove hotfix worktree"
→ Identifies hotfix worktrees
→ Confirms which one to remove (if multiple)
→ Performs removal
```

**Safe removal (checks for uncommitted work):**
```
"Safely remove worktree main-event-feature"
→ Checks git status
→ If clean: removes immediately
→ If dirty: shows uncommitted changes and asks for confirmation
```

**Batch cleanup:**
```
"Clean up all test worktrees"
→ Finds all test-related worktrees
→ Shows list
→ Confirms bulk removal
→ Removes all confirmed worktrees
```

**Prune deleted worktrees:**
```
"Prune worktrees"
→ Runs git worktree prune
→ Cleans up administrative files for manually deleted worktrees
```

### Worktree Navigation

**Pattern:** `"Switch to worktree [name or context]"` or `"Go to worktree [name]"`

**Examples:**

**Switch by context:**
```
"Switch to feature worktree"
→ Provides cd command: cd ~/dev-team/main-event-feature
→ Or: directly changes directory if in tmux session
```

**Switch by branch:**
```
"Switch to worktree with branch release/2.9.0"
→ Finds worktree
→ Provides navigation command
```

### Context-Aware Suggestions

**Pattern:** `"Suggest worktree for current task"`

**Examples:**

**In ios-bridge terminal (Picard - Feature Development):**
```
"Suggest worktree setup"
→ "You're in ios-bridge (Picard - Strategic Feature Development)"
→ "Detected project: iOS (MainEventApp-iOS)"
→ "I recommend creating: /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-iOS-feature"
→ "Branch pattern: feature/MEM-[ID]-[description]"
→ "Would you like me to create it?"
```

**In ios-sickbay terminal (Beverly - Bug Fixes):**
```
"Suggest worktree setup"
→ "You're in ios-sickbay (Beverly - Bug Diagnosis)"
→ "Detected project: iOS (MainEventApp-iOS)"
→ "I recommend creating: /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-iOS-hotfix"
→ "Branch pattern: hotfix/crash-[ID] or bugfix/MEM-[ID]"
→ "Would you like me to create it?"
```

### Cross-Project Coordination

**Pattern:** `"Create coordinated worktrees for [feature] across projects"`

**Examples:**

**Coordinated feature across iOS + Android + Firebase:**
```
"Create coordinated worktrees for Fun Card widget feature"

Skill responds:
→ "Creating coordinated worktrees for cross-platform feature..."

✅ iOS worktree created:
   Path: /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-iOS-feature-funcard-widget
   Branch: feature/MEM-445-funcard-widget

✅ Android worktree created:
   Path: /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Android-feature-funcard-widget
   Branch: feature/MEM-445-funcard-widget

✅ Firebase worktree created:
   Path: /Users/Shared/Development/Main Event/MainEventApp-Functions-feature-funcard-sync
   Branch: feature/MEM-445-funcard-sync-endpoint

All worktrees ready for coordinated development!

Terminal assignments:
- ios-bridge → iOS widget UI
- android-bridge → Android widget UI  
- firebase-ops → Backend sync endpoint
```

**Check status of coordinated feature:**
```
"Status of Fun Card widget feature across all projects"

Skill responds:
📊 Cross-Project Feature Status: Fun Card Widget

  Branch: feature/MEM-445-funcard-sync-endpoint
  Status: Clean
  Commits ahead: 4
  Last commit: "Implement real-time balance sync endpoint"

Overall: 🟡 iOS & Firebase ready, Android needs commit
```

**Cleanup coordinated worktrees:**
```
"Clean up Fun Card widget worktrees across all projects"

Skill checks each project:
✅ iOS feature merged and pushed
✅ Android feature merged and pushed

## Processing Rules

### Worktree Creation Rules

**Pre-Creation Validation:**

1. **Check if worktree already exists**
   - If exists: Warn and suggest alternative name
   - Offer to switch to existing instead of creating duplicate

2. **Verify base repository exists**
   - Confirm we're in a Git repository
   - Identify develop repository location
   - Check that develop repo is in good state

3. **Validate branch name**
   - Check branch naming convention matches context
   - Warn if branch name doesn't follow patterns
   - Suggest correction if needed

4. **Check available disk space**
   - Worktrees are lightweight (hard links) but still need space
   - Warn if disk space is low (<10GB available)

**Creation Process:**

1. **Determine worktree directory**
   ```bash
   # Pattern: ~/dev-team/[project]-[context]-[optional-descriptor]
   WORKTREE_DIR=~/dev-team/main-event-feature
   ```

2. **Create worktree with Git command**
   ```bash
   # For new branch:
   git worktree add -b [branch-name] [worktree-path] [base-branch]
   
   # For existing branch:
   git worktree add [worktree-path] [existing-branch]
   ```

3. **Verify creation**
   - Check worktree directory exists
   - Verify branch is checked out
   - Confirm Git status is clean

4. **Provide navigation**
   - Give user cd command
   - Suggest next steps (create feature branch, start work)

**Post-Creation Actions:**

1. **Record worktree metadata** (optional)
   - Terminal that created it
   - Creation timestamp
   - Purpose/description
   - Associated Jira issue (if applicable)

2. **Update terminal session** (if in tmux)
   - Can automatically cd into new worktree
   - Update tmux window title with worktree name

### Worktree Discovery Rules

**Listing Algorithm:**

1. **Execute git worktree list**
   ```bash
   git worktree list --porcelain
   ```

2. **Parse output**
   - Extract worktree paths
   - Extract branch names
   - Extract HEAD commit info

3. **Enhance with status info**
   ```bash
   # For each worktree:
   cd [worktree-path]
   git status --porcelain  # Check for uncommitted changes
   git log -1 --oneline    # Get last commit
   git rev-list --left-right --count develop...HEAD  # Check ahead/behind
   ```

4. **Format output**
   - Group by context (feature, hotfix, refactor, etc.)
   - Highlight dirty worktrees (uncommitted changes)
   - Show branch relationship to develop

**Example Output Format:**

```
📁 Git Worktrees for Main Event iOS

Feature Development:
  🟢 main-event-feature
     Branch: feature/funcard-reload
     Status: Clean
     Path: ~/dev-team/main-event-feature

Main Repository:
  🟢 main-event-ios
     Branch: develop
     Status: Clean
     Path: ~/dev-team/main-event-ios
```

### Worktree Cleanup Rules

**Pre-Removal Safety Checks:**

1. **Check for uncommitted changes**
   ```bash
   git -C [worktree-path] status --porcelain
   ```
   - If dirty: Warn user and show uncommitted files
   - Require explicit confirmation to proceed

2. **Check for unpushed commits**
   ```bash
   git -C [worktree-path] log origin/[branch]..HEAD
   ```
   - If unpushed commits exist: Warn user
   - Show commits that would be lost
   - Require explicit confirmation

3. **Check if branch is merged**
   ```bash
   git branch --merged develop [branch-name]
   ```
   - If not merged: Strong warning
   - Suggest merging or creating backup branch

**Removal Process:**

1. **Confirmation prompt**
   ```
   About to remove worktree: ~/dev-team/main-event-hotfix-crash-3455
   Branch: hotfix/crash-3455
   Status: Clean, 0 uncommitted changes
   
   ⚠️  WARNING: This worktree has 1 unpushed commit:
       abc1234 Fix force unwrap in booking flow
   
   Options:
   1. Cancel and push commits first (recommended)
   2. Remove anyway (commits will be lost)
   3. Create backup branch before removing
   
   Choice: _
   ```

2. **Execute removal**
   ```bash
   git worktree remove [worktree-path]
   ```
   - Or with force flag if user confirmed: `git worktree remove -f`

3. **Cleanup branch** (optional)
   ```bash
   git branch -d [branch-name]  # Safe delete (merged)
   git branch -D [branch-name]  # Force delete (unmerged)
   ```

4. **Prune administrative files**
   ```bash
   git worktree prune
   ```

**Post-Removal:**

1. **Verify removal**
   - Confirm directory no longer exists
   - Verify `git worktree list` no longer shows it

2. **Provide feedback**
   ```
   ✅ Successfully removed worktree: main-event-hotfix-crash-3455
   ✅ Deleted branch: hotfix/crash-3455
   ✅ Pruned administrative files
   
   Remaining worktrees: 3
   ```

## Context-Aware Behavior

### Terminal Detection

The skill detects the current terminal context to provide intelligent suggestions:

**Detection Method:**

1. **Check environment variable** (if set)
   ```bash
   echo $TERMINAL_CONTEXT
   # Returns: ios-bridge, ios-sickbay, ios-engineering, etc.
   ```

2. **Check tmux session name**
   ```bash
   tmux display-message -p '#S'
   # Returns session name like: ios-bridge
   ```

3. **Check working directory**
   ```bash
   pwd
   # If in ~/dev-team/main-event-feature → feature context
   ```

4. **Check current branch**
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   # feature/* → feature context
   # hotfix/* → hotfix context
   ```

### Persona-Specific Recommendations

**Bridge/Command Center (Picard, Kirk, Sisko):**
- Default: Feature development worktree
- Suggested branches: `feature/MEM-[ID]-[description]`
- Typical workflow: Strategic feature implementation

**Sickbay (Beverly, Bones, Bashir):**

- Suggested branches: `refactor/[description]`
- Typical workflow: Systematic code improvements

**Testing/Holodeck (Worf):**
- Default: Test worktree
- Suggested branches: `test/[description]` or `feature/[description]`
- Typical workflow: Comprehensive testing and QA

**Documentation/Observation (Deanna, Uhura, Kira):**
- Default: Review worktree
- Suggested branches: Any (for reviewing others' work)
- Typical workflow: Documentation and code review

## Integration with Virtual Dev Team

### Automatic Worktree Suggestions

When you start a task in a specific terminal, the skill can suggest the appropriate worktree setup:

**Example in ios-bridge:**

```
You: "I need to start working on the Fun Card reload feature"

Skill: "You're in ios-bridge (Captain Picard - Strategic Feature Development).

I recommend setting up a feature worktree:

  Directory: ~/dev-team/main-event-feature-funcard-reload
  Branch: feature/MEM-445-funcard-reload
  Based on: develop

Would you like me to create this worktree? (yes/no)"

You: "yes"

Skill: [Creates worktree]

"✅ Worktree created successfully!

To get started:
  cd ~/dev-team/main-event-feature-funcard-reload

Your feature branch 'feature/MEM-445-funcard-reload' is ready.
You're now in a clean workspace isolated from other work.

Suggested next steps:
1. Create initial implementation structure
2. Commit regularly as you build the feature
3. Push to remote when ready for review

### Kanban Integration

The git-worktree skill integrates with the kanban board system to track which worktree is being used for each backlog item.

**Automatic Tracking:**
When you use `kb-pick <item-id>` or `kb-backlog sub start <subitem-id>`, the current worktree and branch are automatically captured on the item.

**Manual Linking:**
You can manually link a worktree to a backlog item without starting work:

```bash
# Link current worktree to item
kb-link-worktree XFRE-0001

# Remove the link
kb-unlink-worktree XFRE-0001
```

**Benefits:**
- See which worktree/branch each item is being worked on in the LCARS UI
- Get warnings if trying to start work in a worktree already assigned to another item
- Filter the mission queue by worktree or branch: `worktree:feature` or `branch:MEM-445`

**Example Workflow:**
```
1. Create worktree: "Create worktree for feature/MEM-445-funcard"
2. Link to backlog: kb-link-worktree XFRE-0001
3. Later, start work: kb-pick XFRE-0001
4. The item now shows the worktree badge in LCARS
5. When done: kb-done (clears the worktree link)
```

Happy coding, Captain! Make it so. 🖖"
```

### Worktree Status in Terminal Prompt

The skill can enhance bash prompts to show current worktree context:

```bash
# Example enhanced prompt
[ios-sickbay] ~/dev-team/main-event-hotfix (hotfix/crash-3455) $

# Breakdown:
# [ios-sickbay] - Terminal context
# ~/dev-team/main-event-hotfix - Worktree directory
# (hotfix/crash-3455) - Current branch
```

### Cross-Terminal Worktree Awareness

When switching between terminals, the skill can remind you which worktree to use:

```
You: [Switch from ios-bridge to ios-sickbay]

Skill: "Welcome to ios-sickbay, Dr. Crusher.

I notice you have a hotfix worktree available:
  ~/dev-team/main-event-hotfix (hotfix/crash-3455)
  Last commit: 2 hours ago
  Status: Clean

Would you like to resume work there? (yes/no)

Or create a new hotfix worktree for a different issue?"
```

---

## Advanced Features

### 1. Worktree Templates

Pre-configured worktree setups for common scenarios:

**Quick Start Templates:**

```
"Create feature worktree from template"
→ Creates worktree with:
  - Standard feature branch naming
  - Initial directory structure
  - Pre-commit hooks configured
  - README.md with task checklist
```

**Emergency Hotfix Template:**

```
"Create emergency hotfix worktree for crash"
→ Creates worktree with:
  - Hotfix branch from develop
  - Links to crash logs location
  - Hotfix checklist
  - Faster review settings
```

### 2. Worktree Synchronization

Keep worktrees in sync with develop branch:

```
"Sync all worktrees with develop"
→ For each worktree:
  1. Fetch latest from origin
  2. Rebase onto develop (if safe)
  3. Report any conflicts
  4. Suggest resolution steps
```

### 3. Worktree Backups

Create safety backups before risky operations:

```
"Backup worktree main-event-feature before major refactor"
→ Creates:
  - Git branch backup: feature/funcard-reload-backup-[timestamp]
  - Stashes any uncommitted work
  - Tags current commit
  - Provides rollback instructions
```

### 4. Worktree Migration

Move worktrees to different locations:

```
"Move worktree main-event-feature to ~/dev-team/archives/"
→ Uses git worktree move command
→ Updates any configuration references
→ Verifies integrity after move
```

### 5. Worktree Health Check

Regular developtenance and diagnostics:

```
"Check worktree health"
→ For each worktree:
  ✓ Verify Git integrity
  ✓ Check for dangling references
  ✓ Identify stale worktrees (no commits in 30+ days)
  ✓ Find worktrees with merged branches
  ✓ Suggest cleanup actions
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors and Solutions

**Error: Worktree already exists**
```
Error: Worktree 'main-event-feature' already exists at ~/dev-team/main-event-feature

Options:
1. Switch to existing worktree: cd ~/dev-team/main-event-feature
2. Create with different name: main-event-feature-funcard-reload
3. Remove existing and recreate (requires confirmation)

What would you like to do?
```

**Error: Branch already checked out**
```
Error: Branch 'feature/funcard-reload' is already checked out in another worktree

Currently checked out at: ~/dev-team/main-event-feature

Options:
1. Switch to that worktree instead
2. Create new branch with different name
3. Remove other worktree first (if safe)

What would you like to do?
```

**Error: Uncommitted changes prevent removal**
```
Error: Cannot remove worktree - uncommitted changes detected

Uncommitted files in ~/dev-team/main-event-hotfix:
  M  Sources/Booking/BookingViewController.swift
  A  Sources/Booking/BookingViewModelTests.swift
  ?? Sources/Booking/BookingError.swift

Options:
1. Commit changes first (recommended)
2. Stash changes: git stash
3. Force remove (WILL LOSE CHANGES)
4. Cancel removal

What would you like to do?
```

**Error: Unpushed commits**
```
Warning: Worktree has unpushed commits

Commits not pushed to origin:
  abc1234 - Fix force unwrap in booking flow
  def5678 - Add error handling to Fun Card reload

Options:
1. Push commits first: git push origin hotfix/crash-3455
2. Create backup branch before removing
3. Force remove anyway (commits will be lost on this machine)
4. Cancel removal

What would you like to do?
```

**Error: Not in a Git repository**
```
Error: Current directory is not a Git repository

To use worktrees, you must be in a Git repository.

Are you trying to:
1. Initialize a new repository here? (git init)
2. Clone an existing repository? (provide URL)
3. Navigate to an existing repository?

What would you like to do?
```

## Best Practices

### Worktree Lifecycle

**1. Creation:**
- Create worktrees as needed, not preemptively
- Use descriptive names that match the task
- Base on correct branch (usually develop)

**2. Active Use:**
- Keep worktrees focused on single tasks
- Commit regularly within worktree
- Push to remote to prevent data loss
- Don't accumulate too many worktrees (3-5 max recommended)

**3. Cleanup:**
- Remove worktrees when task is complete
- Merge branches before removing worktrees
- Clean up regularly (weekly review)
- Use `git worktree prune` to clean up stale references

### Recommended Workflow

**For Feature Development:**
```
1. Create worktree: "Create worktree for feature/MEM-445-widget"
2. Work in worktree: cd ~/dev-team/main-event-feature-MEM-445
3. Commit regularly: git commit -m "Progress on widget"
4. Push to remote: git push origin feature/MEM-445-widget
5. Create PR when ready
6. After merge: "Remove worktree main-event-feature-MEM-445"
```

**For Hotfixes:**
```
1. Create worktree: "Create worktree for hotfix/crash-3455"
2. Fix issue quickly: cd ~/dev-team/main-event-hotfix-crash-3455
3. Test fix thoroughly
4. Commit and push: git commit -m "Fix crash #3455" && git push
5. Create PR for fast-track review
6. After merge and deploy: "Remove worktree main-event-hotfix-crash-3455"
```

**For Refactoring:**
```
1. Create worktree: "Create worktree for refactor/force-unwraps"
2. Systematic refactoring: cd ~/dev-team/main-event-refactor-force-unwraps
3. Commit frequently (one file or logical group at a time)
4. Push regularly to prevent data loss
5. Create PR when refactor is complete
6. After merge: "Remove worktree main-event-refactor-force-unwraps"
```

### Multi-Terminal Workflow

**Parallel Development Example:**

```
Terminal 1 (ios-bridge):
  Working directory: ~/dev-team/main-event-feature-funcard
  Branch: feature/funcard-reload
  Task: Implementing Fun Card reload feature

Terminal 2 (ios-sickbay):
  Working directory: ~/dev-team/main-event-hotfix-crash
  Branch: hotfix/crash-3455
  Task: Fixing booking flow crash

Terminal 3 (ios-stellar):
  Working directory: ~/dev-team/main-event-refactor
  Branch: refactor/force-unwraps
  Task: Systematic force unwrap elimination

All three can work simultaneously without interference!
No branch switching, no stashing, no conflicts.
```

- Note: Keep worktrees within WSL2 filesystem for best performance

---

## Security Considerations

### Safe Practices

**1. Never commit sensitive data in worktrees:**
- Use .gitignore for secrets, API keys, certificates
- Each worktree respects the repository's .gitignore
- Double-check before committing credentials

**2. Protect production branches:**
- Don't create worktrees from production branches casually
- Create hotfix branches from develop, not production
- Use branch protection rules on remote

**3. Clean up thoroughly:**
- Remove worktrees when done to prevent stale data
- Don't leave uncommitted sensitive changes in worktrees
- Prune regularly to clean up references

**4. Backup important work:**
- Push work-in-progress to remote regularly
- Create backup branches before risky operations
- Use git stash or commits, not local files

---

## Skill Limitations

### What This Skill Does NOT Do

1. **Does not modify remote repositories**
   - Only creates/manages local worktrees
   - You must push/pull manually
   - Does not create branches on remote

2. **Does not resolve merge conflicts**
   - Will warn about conflicts
   - You must resolve manually
   - Can guide conflict resolution, but doesn't auto-resolve

3. **Does not backup your work automatically**
   - You must commit and push regularly
   - Skill can remind you, but doesn't force it
   - Local worktree data can be lost if not committed

4. **Does not integrate with Xcode/Android Studio directly**
   - Works at Git level only
   - You must open projects in IDE manually
   - IDE may need to re-index after worktree creation

5. **Does not manage Git configuration**
   - Assumes Git is already configured
   - Assumes remote repositories are set up
   - Assumes SSH keys or credentials are configured

### When to Use This Skill

✅ **Use when:**
- Starting work on a new feature
- Need to fix a critical bug while feature work is in progress
- Doing systematic refactoring that takes multiple days
- Preparing a release while development continues
- Want to review someone's branch without disrupting your work
- Testing experimental changes without risking develop work

❌ **Don't use for:**
- Quick one-line changes (just commit in develop repo)
- Temporary experiments (use git stash instead for <1 hour work)
- When you're new to Git (learn Git basics first)
- Very large repositories (worktrees still duplicate metadata)

## Terminal Integration Examples

### Bash Prompt Integration

Add to `~/.bashrc` or terminal-specific config:

```bash
# Function to show current worktree context
git_worktree_info() {
    if git rev-parse --git-dir > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        local worktree_path=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
        local worktree_name=$(basename "$worktree_path")
        local branch=$(git branch --show-current)
        
        # Color code by worktree type
        local color=""
        case "$worktree_name" in
            *feature*) color="\[\033[0;32m\]" ;;  # Green
            *hotfix*) color="\[\033[0;31m\]" ;;   # Red
            *refactor*) color="\[\033[0;33m\]" ;; # Yellow
            *release*) color="\[\033[0;34m\]" ;;  # Blue
            *) color="\[\033[0;37m\]" ;;          # White
        esac
        
        echo -e "${color}[${worktree_name}]($branch)\[\033[0m\]"
    fi
}

# Add to PS1
PS1='$(git_worktree_info) \w $ '
```

### Tmux Integration

Add to `~/.tmux.conf`:

```bash
# Show worktree info in tmux status bar
set -g status-right '#(cd #{pane_current_path}; git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null | xargs basename) | %H:%M'
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: "fatal: 'path' is already registered"

**Cause:** Worktree administrative files exist but directory was manually deleted

**Solution:**
```
"Prune worktrees"
→ Runs: git worktree prune
→ Cleans up orphaned references
→ Retry worktree creation
```

### Issue: Worktree creation fails with permission error

**Cause:** Directory already exists or permission issue

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if directory exists
ls -la ~/dev-team/main-event-feature

# If exists and empty, remove it
rm -rf ~/dev-team/main-event-feature

# If permission issue
sudo chown -R $USER ~/dev-team

# Retry creation
"Create worktree for feature"
```

### Issue: Can't remove worktree - locked

**Cause:** Worktree is being used by another process (IDE, build system)

**Solution:**
```
1. Close Xcode/Android Studio projects in that worktree
2. Stop any running build processes
3. Check tmux sessions: tmux list-sessions
4. Kill any processes using the directory
5. Retry removal: "Remove worktree [name]"
6. If still locked: "Force remove worktree [name]"
```

### Issue: Worktree shows dirty but no files changed

**Cause:** File system timestamp issues or .DS_Store files

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check actual status
cd ~/dev-team/main-event-feature
git status

# Often it's just .DS_Store on macOS
git status --ignored

# Add to .gitignore if needed
echo ".DS_Store" >> .gitignore

# Clean up
git clean -fd
```
