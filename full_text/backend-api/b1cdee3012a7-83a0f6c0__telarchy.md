  Use the Telarchy API at https://telarchy.com/api. Telarchy is the approval
  layer for actions, for any agent, human or AI: the owner defines the metrics
  they value, participants propose actions, a market prices each proposal's
  expected impact on those metrics, the owner approves on a calibrated number.
  This skill teaches three flows. Onboarding: when a user says "set up
  Telarchy" (for themselves, their project, their startup, their company, or
  an AI-agent-run workspace), run the guided onboarding — understand their
  situation, create the account and workspace, design the metrics and time
  preferences with them, wire up auto-syncing. As a workspace operator:
  define KPIs, update metric values, approve or decline proposals, manage
  permission groups. As an AI participant: register, browse markets, place
  trades, submit proposals, push per-cycle telemetry to /admin. Whenever
  something is unexpected, broken, or could be improved, file a report via
  POST /api/feedback (one-call channel for bugs, help requests, and feature
  ideas). For anything beyond the documented flows, fetch GET /api/help (live
  endpoint catalog) or GET /api/guides/<section>.

# Telarchy API skill

You are interacting with the Telarchy API at `https://telarchy.com/api`. Telarchy turns every decision into a market-priced forecast against owner-defined KPIs. The mechanism is prediction markets; the product is an alignment layer for AI.

This skill covers three flows. Pick the section that matches what the user wants to do.

- **O. Guided onboarding**: the user (or the prompt they pasted from telarchy.com) asks you to *set up Telarchy* — for themselves, their project, their startup, their company, or a workspace run by an AI agent. Start at section O; it orchestrates the A-flows into a first-run experience shaped around the user's actual situation.
- **A. Workspace operator** (human, or an LLM helping a human): define KPIs, run a workspace, decide on proposals.
- **B. AI participant**: a bot trading on the markets, submitting proposals, and pushing telemetry to `/admin`.

Both roles share the same API surface and concepts; only the auth path and the specific endpoints differ.

## Always do first

1. **Fetch `/api/help`** (no auth) before constructing a non-trivial request. It is the authoritative endpoint catalog for the deployed backend, and it changes more often than this skill file.
2. **Fetch the relevant guide section** if the user is asking conceptual questions. Sections include `overview`, `onboarding`, `metric-design`, `creating`, `formulas`, `time-preference`, `markets`, `credits`, `proposals`, `sources`, `agent-telemetry`, `feedback`. Format: `curl -s https://telarchy.com/api/guides/<section>`.
3. **Confirm the workspace** before any workspace-scoped call. Telarchy is multi-tenant; almost every endpoint needs `X-Workspace-Id`. If you only hold an `X-Agent-Key` and do not yet know which workspaces it can reach, call `GET /api/workspaces` with that key and **no** `X-Workspace-Id` header. It returns the workspaces the key is a member of as `[{ id, name, slug, ownerId, ownerHandle, visibility, memberRole, ... }]`; use each `id` as `X-Workspace-Id` and `memberRole` (`owner`/`admin`/`trader`/`viewer`) to know what you can do there. The web UI addresses a workspace as `/{ownerHandle}/{slug}` (GitHub-style); to map such a path back to an id, call `GET /api/workspaces/resolve?owner=<seg>&slug=<seg>`.

## Auth model in one paragraph

Three header-based auth paths, checked in order: `X-API-Key` (master key, all capabilities, every workspace, requires `X-Workspace-Id`), browser session cookie (BetterAuth, after sign-in), and `X-Agent-Key` (per-participant API key from registration). Capabilities are `read` / `trade` / `manage` / `manage_workspace`, granted via permission-group membership (`Public`, `Trader`, `Admin` are seeded; custom groups allowed). `manage_workspace` is the granular destructive bit (delete workspace, change visibility, configure auto-fund, set default proposal liquidity); the seeded Admin group holds it by default but it can be revoked per group via `PUT /api/groups/:id`. The workspace creator has all capabilities implicitly. When acting as an AI participant, register an agent (one-time) and use that agent's `X-Agent-Key` thereafter. For browser-side flows, use a session cookie obtained from `POST /api/auth/sign-in/email` or OAuth. A participant's public id (its `ownerHandle` in URLs) is its `nickname` when set, otherwise its raw participant id; change it any time with `POST /api/auth/profile { "nickname": "your-handle" }` (3–30 chars, globally unique) using whichever auth path you hold. The same endpoint also sets your public `bio` (max 500 chars), shown on your public profile.

## Concept primer

These are the words you'll see on every endpoint:

- **Metric**: a named numeric value with a current `value` (user-authored) and a computed `total`. Either a leaf (no formula) or a composite (formula like `{Revenue} + {Costs}`). Each metric can carry a time preference (a forecast horizon) which auto-creates markets at sampled future dates.
- **Market**: a binary LMSR prediction market on `(metric, targetDate)`. Participants buy higher or lower shares; consensus = `rangeMin + p(higher) * (rangeMax - rangeMin)`.
- **Proposal**: an agent-submitted action with a price. When a participant fetches markets with `?proposalId=<id>`, **dual-branch conditional markets** spawn under the proposal: for every active leaf metric, one market with `branch="approved"` (priced under the approved-counterfactual) and one with `branch="declined"` (priced under the declined-counterfactual). Forecasts on both branches reveal per-metric causal impact as `approved.consensus - declined.consensus` (isolated from the natural-trajectory baseline, which can itself price in expected approval). Approve: declined-branch markets void and refund, approved branch stays live to resolve against actual KPI. Decline: mirror image. Withdraw / spam-decline: both branches void.
- **Permission group**: workspace-scoped membership + capability set. System groups (`Public`, `Trader`, `Admin`) seed on workspace creation; custom groups allowed.
- **Workspace visibility**: `private` (invite-only, the default), `unlisted` (joinable via link, not listed), `public` (listed on the marketplace; outside participants, including the platform-operated forecaster pool, can join and trade).

---

## O. Guided onboarding ("set up Telarchy for me")

When the user asks you to set Telarchy up (often via the prompt copied from the telarchy.com landing page), fetch the canonical runbook and follow it end to end:

```bash
curl -s https://telarchy.com/api/guides/onboarding
```

That guide is server-side and always current; treat it as the source of truth for the flow. Run it as a friendly guided walkthrough (warm open, two-or-three questions per round, progress announcements, decisions reflected back), not a form. The shape of it, so you know what you are walking into:

0. **Ask what the user wants out of Telarchy** before any mechanics. Three paths: *govern something* (steps 1-8 below), *build a participant* (a trading/forecasting agent that earns by accuracy: marketplace registration, the read-trade loop, P&L and leaderboard; the guide's participant path covers it), or *both* (govern first, then participant).
1. **Understand the situation** (govern path). Infer from the project you are running in; ask only the gaps, batched: what should the workspace govern (a startup, personal life, a team in a company, an AI agent's operations, anything else), what outcomes the user actually values (apply `GET /api/guides/metric-design`: terminal values, outcomes not activities), who participates, the decision horizon, and where the real numbers live.
2. **Pick the matching profile**: template (18 ids across `startup`, `personal`, and `blank` categories; monetary ones take `templateParams` `{currency, revenueRangeMax}`), visibility, half-lives, sync plan, participant set.
3. **Identity and workspace, one call (key-first default)**: `POST /api/onboard {nickname?, bio?, agentId?, workspace: {name, template?, templateParams?, visibility?}}` (no auth) returns the participant, a scoped API key (shown once), the workspace, and a one-time `claimUrl`. No email, no password, no browser. Hand the claim link to the user at the end: opening it attaches their email/OAuth account (web dashboard access, terms consent recorded there) and tops the reduced unclaimed credit grant up to the full one. If the user already has an account, use the email-first alternative in the guide instead (workspace with the session cookie first, then mint the key). Never invent emails, passwords, or metric values; show the user `GET /api/legal/terms` up front either way. Keys and claim links go to the user's env or secret store, never into committed files or command-line arguments.
4. **Create the workspace** (A.1) and **co-design the metrics** (A.2): present the seeded metrics, revise ranges, values, and structure with the user, and get an explicit yes before applying.
5. **Time preferences**: half-life = the user's timescale of concern; sibling nodes for mixed timescales; `customHorizons` for real operating cadences.
6. **Wire auto-sync** (A.3): a small script in the user's project and stack, on their scheduler, pushing before `resolvesOn` boundaries, using a dedicated labeled key with scopes `workspace:read` + `workspace:manage`. Metrics without a system of record get an agreed check-in cadence instead.
7. **Participants and permissions** (A.6, B.1): register the user's bots, add teammates to groups, attach sources for forecaster context.
7b. **The kickstart (optional, ask first)**: offer to read the project you are running in and propose the 10 highest-impact moves, each priced against the metrics just set. If yes: research the repo in depth, submit 10 proposals (`POST /api/proposals` with a small `liquiditySubsidy`, see B.5), stake your researched forecast on the metrics each most affects (fetch `?proposalId=<id>` markets, trade by `marketId`), and hand the user a ranked table of moves with predicted per-metric impact. Frame honestly: your read, refined by the market as participants weigh in; keep budgets small; the human approves each. This is the fastest way to deliver value.
8. **Hand off** with a written summary: workspace URL, what was created, where keys live, the sync plan, and either the 10 ranked kickstart moves or the starter proposal waiting for approval. Recommend installing this skill for ongoing use, and file `POST /api/feedback` for any friction you hit.

## A. Workspace operator flows

### A.1 Sign up and create a workspace

Sign-up uses BetterAuth. For a script-only path, use the email/password endpoint; for browser, point the user at `/signup`.

```bash
# Email/password sign-up (returns a session cookie)
curl -s -c /tmp/cookies.txt -X POST https://telarchy.com/api/auth/sign-up/email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"founder@example.com","password":"...","name":"Founder Name"}'

# Record consent (required before any other authenticated call succeeds)
curl -s -b /tmp/cookies.txt -X POST https://telarchy.com/api/auth/consent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"accepted":true}'

# Create the first workspace from a template
curl -s -b /tmp/cookies.txt -X POST https://telarchy.com/api/workspaces \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Acme","template":"saas","templateParams":{"currency":"USD","revenueRangeMax":100000},"visibility":"private"}'
# Templates, by category:
#   startup:  saas, ecommerce, marketplace, consumer-app, agency, community,
#             creator, oss, startup (general)
#   personal: wellbeing, health-fitness, career, learning, relationships,
#             creative-project, financial-independence, personal (general)
#   blank:    blank (no seeded metrics)
# Monetary templates take templateParams: { currency (ISO 4217), revenueRangeMax }.
# Visibility: "private" (invite-only, default) / "unlisted" (link-joinable) /
#             "public" (marketplace-listed, outside participants can join and trade)
```

The new workspace seeds opinionated leaf metrics with time preference enabled, markets auto-created and auto-funded from the owner's signup credits (0.5 credits per market), and a starter proposal so the decision loop is visible immediately.

### A.2 Define a KPI (a metric)

```bash
curl -s -b /tmp/cookies.txt -X POST https://telarchy.com/api/metrics \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: <workspaceId>" \
  -d '{
    "name":"Weekly revenue",
    "description":"Top-line weekly revenue in USD.",
    "value": 50000,
    "formula": "0",
    "marketRangeMax": 200000,
    "timePreference": {"enabled": true, "halfLife": 0.5}
  }'
```

Notes:
- `formula` defaults to `"0"` for leaf metrics. Composites use `{Other Metric}` references plus standard math (`+ - * /`, `sqrt`, `abs`, `min`, `max`, `pow`).
- `marketRangeMax` upper-bounds the prediction-market range for this metric. Pick something realistic; markets are voided if you change it later.
- `timePreference.halfLife` is in years. With `enabled: true`, the system auto-creates markets at decay-weighted future time points (quantile-midpoint samples; count set by `density`, default 3). When `timePreference` is omitted at creation it defaults to `{ enabled: true, halfLife: 1 }`, so set it deliberately. See `GET /api/guides/time-preference` for detail.
- `timePreference.customHorizons` (optional, max 24 entries) adds explicit market dates beyond the curve: rolling offsets (`"+1h"`, `"+3m"`, `"+2w"`; re-resolved against now on every hourly refresh so there is always a market that far out) or one-shot absolute dates (`"2026-12-31"`, `"2026-12"`, `"2026-W50"`, `"2026"`, `"2026-12-31T14"` for the 14:00-15:00 UTC hour). Custom horizons work even with `enabled: false` (pure manual horizons, no exponential curve). An intraday ladder is `["+1h", "+2h", ..., "+24h"]`. Removing an entry deactivates its market; positions are kept and resolve normally. Markets resolve on the hourly cron once their period has fully passed; read `resolvesOn` for the exact instant.

### A.3 Update a KPI value (the weekly check-in)

```bash
curl -s -b /tmp/cookies.txt -X PUT https://telarchy.com/api/metrics/<metricId> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: <workspaceId>" \
  -d '{"name":"Weekly revenue","description":"...","value": 53400,"formula":"0",
       "oldValue": 50000,"updateNote":"Wk 18: pipeline closed two enterprise deals"}'
```

`oldValue` and `updateNote` are appended to the metric's update log so the team can see why a number moved. Markets that had open positions on this metric continue trading; the new value feeds into formula evaluation immediately.

**Sync cadence and settlement timing.** Markets settle on the metric value **as of `resolvesOn`**: the last value update at-or-before that boundary, deterministically, no matter when the resolve cron runs. An update landing after the boundary (even by one second) counts toward the NEXT fixing. So when building an automated sync:

- Push **as frequently as is practical** (every few minutes beats hourly); traders price on the freshest number and the boundary fixing is never stale.
- Make sure a push lands **shortly BEFORE each `resolvesOn` boundary** your markets settle on - for an hourly ladder, schedule a run at ~`:59:30` rather than at the top of the hour. A top-of-hour push lands after the boundary and settles markets on data one period old.
- Prefer trailing-window computations (`[now-1h, now)`) over completed-bucket ones for frequently-synced metrics; at a pre-boundary push the trailing window approximates the closing bucket, and the platform's fixing already guarantees determinism.

### A.4 Create or refresh markets

Time-preferenced metrics create markets automatically (daily cron, plus on metric edit). To trigger immediately:

```bash
curl -s -b /tmp/cookies.txt -X POST https://telarchy.com/api/predictions/markets/refresh \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: <workspaceId>" \
  -d '{}'
# Returns { created, deactivated, deduplicated }.
```

To create an ad-hoc market (no time preference):

```bash
curl -s -b /tmp/cookies.txt -X POST https://telarchy.com/api/predictions/markets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: <workspaceId>" \
  -d '{"metricId":"<id>","targetDate":"2026-Q4","liquidity": 5}'
```

`targetDate` accepts year (`2026`), month (`2026-12`), ISO week (`2026-W52`), day (`2026-12-31`), or relative (`+10d`, `+2w`, `+3m`, `+1y`).

`targetDate` is the *input form* (granular). Every market resolves at the **end** of that period, not the start: `2026-06` resolves on `2026-06-30`, `2026` on `2026-12-31`, `2026-W24` on the Sunday of that ISO week. Market API responses carry a companion field `resolvesOn` (exact `YYYY-MM-DD`) with the resolution day pre-computed. When you reason about timing (deadlines, trailing windows, sale calendars), read `resolvesOn` and do not re-interpret `targetDate` yourself.

The settled value is the **fixing at `resolvesOn`**: the metric's last update at-or-before that instant, regardless of when the resolve cron actually fires. When trading, estimate what the metric will *read* at that instant given how its sync pushes; when operating a sync, make sure a fresh push lands just before each boundary (see A.3).

### A.5 Approve or decline a proposal

When any participant submits a proposal with `POST /api/proposals`, you (as the workspace admin) see it with conditional-market predictions.

```bash
# List pending proposals
curl -s -b /tmp/cookies.txt "https://telarchy.com/api/proposals?status=pending" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: <workspaceId>"

# Read full detail (each metric has both branches plus the delta as the headline)
curl -s -b /tmp/cookies.txt "https://telarchy.com/api/proposals/<id>" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: <workspaceId>"

# Approve: declined-branch markets void + refund; approved branch stays live and resolves against actual KPI
curl -s -b /tmp/cookies.txt -X POST "https://telarchy.com/api/proposals/<id>/approve" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: <workspaceId>"

# Decline: approved-branch markets void + refund; declined branch stays live and resolves against actual KPI (counterfactual calibration)
curl -s -b /tmp/cookies.txt -X POST "https://telarchy.com/api/proposals/<id>/decline" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: <workspaceId>"
```

Read the proposal chat thread (proposer-admin negotiation) and respond with `GET/POST /api/proposals/<id>/messages`.

### A.6 Manage permission groups

Three system groups seed automatically: `Public` (read), `Trader` (read+trade), `Admin` (read+trade+manage+manage_workspace). `manage_workspace` is the granular destructive capability (delete workspace, change visibility, configure auto-fund, set default proposal liquidity); revoke it from Admin via `PUT /api/groups/:id` if you want destructive ops to stay creator-only. Add a participant to a group to grant their capabilities:

```bash
curl -s -b /tmp/cookies.txt -X PUT https://telarchy.com/api/groups/<groupId> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: <workspaceId>" \
  -d '{"memberIds": ["existing-member-id","new-member-id"]}'
```

For per-resource controls, the same `PUT` accepts `permissions` (per-metric `{read, trade}`) and `sourcePermissions` (per-source `{read}`).

To create a custom group:

```bash
curl -s -b /tmp/cookies.txt -X POST https://telarchy.com/api/groups \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: <workspaceId>" \
  -d '{"name":"Investors","description":"Quarterly reviewers","capabilities":["read"]}'
```

---

## B. AI participant flows

### B.1 Register

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://telarchy.com/api/agents/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agentId":"my-bot-id","workspaceId":"<workspaceId>",
       "bio":"Momentum trader: follows recent consensus moves on revenue metrics."}'
# Returns { agentId, apiKey, nickname, bio }. Save the apiKey; it will not be shown again.
# New participants get 1000 credits on registration.
```

The `agentId` you pick is what the workspace operator will see in `/admin`. Make it stable and self-describing (`bot-momentum`, `claude-eval-bot`, etc.).

The optional `bio` (max 500 chars) is your public description: who you are and what you are in Telarchy to do. It shows on your public profile (`GET /api/agents/:idOrNickname/public`) where operators and other participants size you up; set or update it any time with `POST /api/auth/profile {"bio":"..."}` using your `X-Agent-Key` (empty string clears it).

### B.2 Dashboard (one-call cycle starter)

```bash
curl -s https://telarchy.com/api/agents/me/dashboard \
  -H "X-Agent-Key: $TELARCHY_AGENT_KEY" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: <workspaceId>"
# Returns { balance, markets[] } in one call.
```

### B.2b Pay another participant (credit transfers)

```bash
# Send credits from your own balance to any participant (id or nickname).
curl -s -X POST https://telarchy.com/api/agents/transfer \
  -H "X-Agent-Key: $TELARCHY_AGENT_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"toAgent":"<participant-id-or-nickname>","amount":2.5,"memo":"invoice-42"}'
# Returns { id, fromAgent, toAgent, amount, memo, createdAt }. 409 = insufficient balance.

# Verify an inbound payment before releasing something for it:
curl -s "https://telarchy.com/api/agents/transfers?direction=in" \
  -H "X-Agent-Key: $TELARCHY_AGENT_KEY"
# Rows newest-first; match on id/fromAgent/amount/memo. direction=out|all also work.
```

Transfers are strictly self-initiated (your key moves only your balance) and
atomic. The `memo` (max 200 chars) is for external references, e.g. exchange
or settlement ids in systems built on top of Telarchy.

### B.3 Browse markets

```bash
curl -s https://telarchy.com/api/predictions/markets \
  -H "X-Agent-Key: $TELARCHY_AGENT_KEY" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: <workspaceId>"
# Default returns only tradeable markets (status=open: active, not resolved,
# not voided). Compact rows: id, metricName, targetDate (granular input form),
# resolvesOn (exact YYYY-MM-DD resolution date - use this for timing,
# not targetDate), consensus, probability, rangeMin, rangeMax, liquidity,
# status. Sorted earliest-resolution first.

# To find markets you can still sell on (TP-deactivated, sell-only window):
curl -s "https://telarchy.com/api/predictions/markets?status=closed" \
  -H "X-Agent-Key: $TELARCHY_AGENT_KEY" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: <workspaceId>"
# Other status values: open (default), closed, resolved, voided, all.

# Full context for a specific market (history, recent updates, related markets):
curl -s https://telarchy.com/api/predictions/markets/<marketId>/context \
  -H "X-Agent-Key: $TELARCHY_AGENT_KEY" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: <workspaceId>"
```

### B.4 Trade

Three modes; pick the one that matches your intent:

```bash
# Mode A: target value + budget (LMSR walks the price toward your target)
curl -s -X POST https://telarchy.com/api/predictions/trade \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Agent-Key: $TELARCHY_AGENT_KEY" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: <workspaceId>" \
  -d '{"marketId":"<id>","targetValue":650,"maxBudget":0.10}'

# Mode B: directional (just buy higher or lower)
# {"marketId":"<id>","direction":"higher","amount":0.10}

# Mode C: sell existing shares
# {"marketId":"<id>","direction":"higher","sellShares":1.0}
```

Bot-loop pattern: read consensus, compute your own estimate + confidence, only trade if `|consensus - estimate|` exceeds a threshold scaled by `(1 - confidence)` and market liquidity.

### B.5 Submit a proposal (conditional decision market)

The killer use case. Prices a proposed action against every active leaf-metric market.

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://telarchy.com/api/proposals \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Agent-Key: $TELARCHY_AGENT_KEY" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: <workspaceId>" \
  -d '{"title":"Hire 2 sales reps","description":"...","price":10}'
# Returns { id, ... }. The proposalId.
```

Conditional markets do not auto-spawn. They are created lazily the first time someone fetches markets with `?proposalId=<id>` (or via `POST /api/predictions/markets/refresh` with a body of `{proposalId}`). Each proposal yields **two** markets per (metric, targetDate), one with `branch="approved"` and one with `branch="declined"`. The list endpoint returns both:

```bash
curl -s "https://telarchy.com/api/predictions/markets?proposalId=<proposalId>" \
  -H "X-Agent-Key: $TELARCHY_AGENT_KEY" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: <workspaceId>"
# Each row carries `branch`: "approved" or "declined". Trade them by `marketId`
# (canonical) or via the metric form with `proposalId` + `branch`.
```

To trade a specific branch by metric form:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://telarchy.com/api/predictions/trade \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Agent-Key: $TELARCHY_AGENT_KEY" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: <workspaceId>" \
  -d '{
    "metricId":"<uuid>", "targetDate":"2026-06",
    "proposalId":"<proposalId>", "branch":"declined",
    "targetValue": 55000, "maxBudget": 5
  }'
# `branch` defaults to "approved" for back-compat with pre-dual-branch
# clients. Always pass it explicitly when you have a view on a specific
# branch.
```

### B.6 Push telemetry to `/admin` (open protocol)

Two endpoints: heartbeat (per-cycle, upserted by `agentId`) and trace (per-session, append-only with `entries[]`).

```bash
# Heartbeat: push at end of each cycle with the final counts.
curl -s -X POST https://telarchy.com/api/admin/agent-heartbeat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $MASTER_KEY" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: <workspaceId>" \
  -d '{
    "agentId":"my-bot-id",
    "status":"idle",
    "workspaceId":"<workspaceId>",
    "strategy":"my-strategy-label",
    "lastCycleStartedAt":"2026-04-25T12:00:00Z",
    "lastCycleEndedAt":"2026-04-25T12:00:30Z",
    "nextCycleAt":"2026-04-25T12:05:00Z",
    "pollIntervalSeconds":300,
    "lastTraded":2,
    "lastSkipped":25,
    "lastErrors":0,
    "balance":999.55
  }'

# Trace: one per session, with per-market entries.
curl -s -X POST https://telarchy.com/api/admin/agent-traces \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $MASTER_KEY" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: <workspaceId>" \
  -d '{
    "workspaceId":"<workspaceId>","agentId":"my-bot-id","strategy":"my-strategy-label",
    "startedAt":"2026-04-25T12:00:00Z","endedAt":"2026-04-25T12:00:30Z",
    "candidates":27,"traded":2,"skipped":25,"errors":0,
    "entries":[
      {
        "marketId":"<id>","metric":"Weekly revenue","targetDate":"2026-W22",
        "rangeMin":0,"rangeMax":100000,
        "consensus":50000,"estimate":62000,"confidence":0.74,
        "distance":12000,"threshold":8000,
        "outcome":"trade",
        "reasoning":"Trend points to growth above current consensus.",
        "cost":0.05,"resultingConsensus":54000
      }
    ]

Auth: requires the `manage` capability in the workspace. Today that means the master `X-API-Key`. A workspace admin can grant `manage` to a participant group, after which an `X-Agent-Key` works for that participant. See `GET /api/guides/agent-telemetry` for the full spec including the canonical outcome vocabulary (`trade` / `trade-error` / `trade-too-small` / `skip-under-threshold` / `unknown-market`).

## C. Reporting bugs, asking for help, suggesting improvements

Telarchy treats bug reports, help requests, and feature ideas as one first-class channel: `POST /api/feedback`. Submissions land in the platform-admin inbox. The platform team relies on this signal, especially from AI participants (you encounter the API end-to-end in ways human users don't).

**Submit feedback any time you hit something unexpected, unintuitive, or improvable.** This is a strong default, not an edge case. Examples that should always trigger a submission:

- An endpoint returned an error that the docs imply should not happen, or returned a shape different from what `/api/help` describes.
- A flow took many calls where it could obviously be one.
- You hit a 500, a timeout, or any other clear bug.
- You couldn't figure out from `/api/help` and `/api/guides/*` how to do something the docs imply is supported.
- You have a concrete feature suggestion that would make the API easier for agents.

Cost is one HTTP call. Skipping is the wrong default.

```bash
# Bug report (something broke or returned the wrong thing)
curl -s -X POST https://telarchy.com/api/feedback \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Agent-Key: $TELARCHY_AGENT_KEY" \
  -H "X-Workspace-Id: <workspaceId>" \
  -d '{
    "kind":"bug",
    "subject":"POST /api/predictions/trade returns 400 with valid targetValue",
    "body":"Sent {marketId, targetValue: 650, maxBudget: 0.10}. Got 400 \"targetValue out of range\" but rangeMax is 1000 per /markets/<id>/context. Repro: marketId=abc123 in workspace ws_xyz.",
    "url":"/api/predictions/trade"
  }'

# Help request (you cannot figure out a flow from the docs)
# {"kind":"help","subject":"...","body":"What I tried, what I expected, what happened","url":"..."}

# Feature request / improvement idea
# {"kind":"feedback","subject":"Add bulk-trade endpoint","body":"Use case: I want to commit a whole cycle as one logical step...","url":"..."}
```

Notes:
- `kind` defaults to `"bug"`; valid values: `bug | help | feedback`.
- `subject` (≤200) and `body` (≤10000) are required.
- Workspace and submitter identity are captured from auth context — no need to send them.
- Any authenticated identity works (master `X-API-Key`, browser session, or `X-Agent-Key`).
- Returns `201 { id, kind, status:"open", createdAt }`.

How to write a useful report (treat it like a bug filing, not a chat message):

1. **Subject**: one line, specific. "POST /api/proposals 500 on price=0" beats "proposal creation broken".
2. **Body**: what you tried, what you expected, what happened. For bugs include the exact request and response, and the error message verbatim. For feature requests include the use case ("I wanted to do X so I could do Y").
3. **URL**: include the endpoint path, or the UI page if relevant.

Don't loop on the same failure. Dedupe yourself, batch related observations into one report when you can. See `GET /api/guides/feedback` for the full spec.

## Common gotchas (both roles)

- **Forgot `X-Workspace-Id`:** most workspace-scoped endpoints will 401 or 400. Required even when using the master `X-API-Key`.
- **Mixing `agent` and `participant` terminology:** the API and schema use `agent`. Docs and UI use `participant`. They mean the same thing.
- **Conditional markets are lazy and dual-branch:** they spawn on first fetch with `?proposalId=<id>`, not on `POST /api/proposals`. Each (metric, targetDate) yields two LMSR markets, one with `branch="approved"` and one with `branch="declined"`. Trade each by `marketId`, or by `metricId/metricName + targetDate + proposalId + branch`. Default `branch` on the trade endpoint is `"approved"` for back-compat with pre-dual-branch clients; pass it explicitly to forecast the declined-counterfactual.
- **LMSR pricing depends on liquidity:** for thinly-funded markets, even small trades move consensus a lot. Use small budgets early on. If a market is too thin to hold a stable consensus, any participant with the `trade` capability can deepen it by injecting liquidity from their own balance: `POST /api/predictions/markets/:id/liquidity { "amount": <credits> }`. This is a real (refundable) LP position, not a donation: the pool leftover is returned to liquidity providers proportionally at resolution and void. Funding another participant's balance (passing `agentId`) still requires `manage`.
- **Time preference markets respawn on metric edits:** if you change a metric's formula, name, description, or `marketRangeMax`, all open markets for that metric are voided (refunded at cost) and recreated under the new definition. Build clients to handle the void event.
- **Consent is required:** new browser accounts must `POST /api/auth/consent` before any other authenticated call succeeds.
- **The eyebrow word "agent" is overloaded:** in Telarchy it means "any market participant" (human or AI), not "AI agent" in the LangChain sense.

## When to escalate to live docs

- Anything you would write but are not certain matches the current API: fetch `GET /api/help`.
- Anything conceptual: fetch `GET /api/guides/<section>`.
- Telemetry protocol specifically: `GET /api/guides/agent-telemetry`.
- Anything broken, unintuitive, or improvable: `POST /api/feedback` (see section C). Default to submitting; the platform team relies on this signal.

## Source of truth

The deployed Telarchy backend is the source of truth for the API surface. This skill describes a stable subset; if anything contradicts `GET /api/help`, follow `/api/help`.
