# Build

Run one durable workflow from an idea to an evidence-backed specification and, when requested, a reviewed implementation.

## Parse the invocation

Support these explicit modes. The examples use standalone `$build`; plugin users apply the same mode suffix to `$openbuild:build` or the namespace assigned by their marketplace:

- `$build new <idea>`: discover, interview, and create or update a specification; stop before implementation.
- `$build refine [path]`: verify and improve an existing specification; stop before implementation.
- `$build run [path]`: bring an existing specification to `Ready`, then implement it.
- `$build full <idea-or-path>`: run discovery, specification, implementation, validation, and review.
- `$build auto <idea-or-path>`: infer the workflow target and start at the first incomplete phase.
- `$build configure-models`: run the guided interview and configure the project or user model map used by every exact-model agent.
- `$build setup-models`: backward-compatible alias for `configure-models`.
- `$build <idea-or-path>`: treat as `auto` when no mode is present.

Do not claim that Build registers `/build` or any other slash command. If a user types `/build` in prose, explain the supported explicit skill invocation instead of silently treating it as an installed command.

Reply and write the specification in the user's language. Keep paths, symbols, commands, and code in their native form.

## Explicit Code Discovery Delegation

OpenBuild implements code discovery only through `scripts/model_map.py` followed by `scripts/agent_runner.py`. Before broad `rg`, route/symbol lookup, owner mapping, or cross-file evidence gathering, resolve the effective discovery route and start its first exact profile as a separate subscription-authenticated Codex process. The packaged default is `openbuild_search_separate` pinned to `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`, low reasoning, and read-only sandbox; an explicitly confirmed project or user map may select a different exact search profile/model while the canonical Explorer instructions and read-only sandbox remain fixed.

Delegate repository search, `rg`, `Get-Content`, and local file reading to that process. Require only a compact evidence map with `path:line`, symbol/route, snippet/signature, and why it matters. Do targeted main-process reads only after its accepted terminal result.

Do not call a native Explorer or any other agent API for discovery. A completed semantic search may advance to the next configured discovery step only for a listed evidence trigger. If the exact runner cannot start, has a transport/infrastructure failure, or finishes with invalid transport evidence, create no replacement agent: record the normalized failure and continue only with the minimum targeted root search needed to unblock the task. A trivial lookup or already-known path may be read directly.

## Initialize search routing

Before locating a specification, repository instructions, validation entry points, files, symbols, tests, routes, schemas, configs, logs, or similar implementations, read [code discovery](references/code-discovery.md) and [model routing](references/model-routing.md) from their already-known skill paths and initialize the exact-runner circuit-breaker state for this Build run.

Before the first non-trivial repository lookup, run `scripts/model_map.py resolve --use-case discovery --risk default --repo <workspace-root> --codex-home <codex-home>`. Persist `map_source`, `map_sha256`, the returned ordered agents, and the current route step. Start the first returned profile through the packaged `scripts/agent_runner.py` launcher, which starts `codex exec -m <model> -c model_reasoning_effort=<effort>`. Do so before the root runs `rg`, `rg --files`, file/symbol lookup, or an equivalent search command. Pass the returned canonical profile ID through `--agent` and an independent descriptive label through `--task-name`. Do not begin the lookup until the exact dispatch succeeds or records a terminal failure; a transport failure permits only the disclosed targeted root route.

Route every repository lookup used by specification selection, baseline discovery, reconciliation, implementation, or review through that order. Direct root reads are allowed only for an explicit user-supplied path, a runtime-provided path, an already-known skill/reference path, or a returned `path:line`; any new file/symbol/grep lookup returns to the search route. Git metadata commands such as branch, status, and `HEAD` inspection remain root-owned and are not code search.

## Run explicit-model agents

Before the first exact CLI dispatch, perform an OS-aware dependency checkpoint. On Windows, run `python --version`. On POSIX, run `python3 --version` first and use `python --version` only as a fallback. Run `codex --version` on every platform. Require Python 3.11 or newer. If either dependency is missing or too old, stop before creating an agent. Only on Windows, show the exact commands `winget install -e --id Python.Python.3.12` and `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.ps1 | iex"`. On POSIX, provide manual, platform-appropriate Python and Codex CLI installation guidance without choosing or running a package manager. Offer either manual installation followed by a user reply or execution of an applicable displayed command only after separate explicit permission. Wait for installation and rerun the OS-appropriate Python check plus `codex --version`, then ask the user to run `codex`, complete ChatGPT sign-in manually, and verify `codex login status`; never automate credentials. If installation or authentication is declined or unavailable, record the checkpoint failure and use only an honest supported fallback.

After that preflight, resolve `<build-skill-root>` from this selected skill's on-disk path. Before every created agent, resolve the effective complete route and exact profiles; never infer a route from chat memory or a hard-coded tier:

```text
model_map.py resolve --use-case discovery --risk default
model_map.py resolve --use-case critic --risk <low|medium|high|critical>
model_map.py resolve --use-case implementation --risk <low|medium|high|critical>
model_map.py resolve --use-case review --risk <low|medium|high|critical>
```

Pass `--repo <workspace-root> --codex-home <codex-home>` on every resolver call. Persist `map_source`, `map_sha256`, use case, risk, ordered agents, `max_steps`, triggers, and route step in the routing record. Stage each bounded UTF-8 prompt through runner-owned `stage-prompt --repo <workspace-root>` on stdin, outside the workspace and without command-line interpolation. Keep its returned private snapshot ID/SHA out of user-facing output, then dispatch the selected role with that immutable binding:

```text
<python-3.11+> <build-skill-root>/scripts/agent_runner.py stage-prompt --repo <workspace-root>  # bounded UTF-8 prompt on stdin
<python-3.11+> <build-skill-root>/scripts/agent_runner.py dispatch --agent <exact-profile> --task-name <independent-label> --repo <workspace-root> --prompt-snapshot-id <private-id> --prompt-sha256 <sha256>
# The runner durably records the unactivated receipt, activates that exact run, and returns its activated receipt.
```

The compatibility `--prompt-file` route accepts only an owner-private external file and imports it through the same stable-object, no-follow, identity, ownership, mode/DACL, UTF-8, and size checks before run-directory, registry, grant, reservation, or process side effects. Never create a prompt, recovery prompt, receipt, ignored helper, or other orchestration artifact inside the workspace.

The launcher requires saved ChatGPT authentication, forces the built-in OpenAI provider plus ChatGPT login method, rejects user-level provider/base-URL redirects, strips ambient API-key/base-URL variables, resolves project profiles before user profiles, and records the exact `-m`, `model_reasoning_effort`, sandbox, creation-bound worker/Codex process identities, JSONL, stderr, final-message, and `codex-exit.json` paths in its private run directory. For every canonical implementation/review override it also requires the exact `routing_rung` and `routing_tuple_confirmed = true`; a known Luna/Terra/Sol model-and-effort tuple must match that rung, while an unknown custom tuple requires explicit rung confirmation and exact capability smoke. `start` launches Codex with stdin held, returns the unactivated running receipt, and cannot release the task prompt; only the later explicit `activate` does that. It supplies the profile contract as developer instructions and mechanically disables the stable `features.multi_agent` capability, so repository/global delegation rules cannot recursively spawn a child. Start independent read-only branches separately when useful; keep implementation workers sequential under the single-writer lease. Every recovery-capable implementation start must supply the complete structured checkpoint tuple: one or more `--allowed-file`, `--specification-revision`, and `--recovery-target-milestone`; supplying only part of that tuple is invalid.

The runner creates each absent run directory with mode `0700` on POSIX or a protected current-user-only DACL on Windows and rejects an existing directory with weaker ownership/permissions. Recovery state lives in an owner-private OS registry bound to the workspace identity and Git common directory; exact 2.2.0/2.2.1 generations remain readable without rewrite-on-read, and the first 2.2.2 durable transition raises the `2.2.2` reader floor and rejects unsafe downgrade until an explicitly vacant registry is retired. Registry and private-source generations must satisfy exact top-level and nested allowlist schemas before durable replacement and again on reload. Unknown lifecycle fields, invalid state-specific evidence, malformed authorization, and any raw private path in a public checkpoint projection fail closed even when the stored digest is self-consistent. Every contained process-bound/running/terminal lease must cross-bind its provider and IPC plan IDs, guardian identity, affirmative provider precommit, and worker PID/creation identity to the applicable reserved plan; terminal zero proof and guardian close must repeat that exact guardian/provider/process identity. `needs-escalation` semantic rejection first requires a freshly captured private snapshot byte-equal to the authoritative pre-snapshot. Every semantic rejection must also satisfy the exact `blocked` versus `needs-escalation` checkpoint matrix, one lease/run/source-bound rejection history event, and—before completed escalation may close—one matching invalidation event plus reload-validated private-source invalidation. Missing or drifting evidence cannot reload or activate. A recovery-capable Windows run is placed before prompt release into a kill-on-close Job owned by an authenticated outside-Job guardian. Linux recovery requires explicitly verified cgroup v2 delegation and creates the worker inside that cgroup before exec through `clone3(CLONE_INTO_CGROUP)`, then establishes a worker-private cgroup/mount namespace boundary: every cgroup view is remounted read-only, migration writes and inherited control descriptors are rejected, capabilities are dropped, and guardian membership is revalidated before commit and zero proof. The production module exposes no post-spawn cgroup attachment path. If any check is unavailable before the durable process boundary, a normal source run may use one teardown-proven ordinary-process fallback with recovery disabled, while a recovery target fails closed and never falls back. Provider or guardian loss at or after the durable boundary quarantines the lease.

The runner uses precise OS creation identities (Windows process handle time, Linux proc start ticks, or macOS microsecond start time), refuses process-group signalling after PID reuse, distinguishes zombie-only POSIX groups from executing descendants before reaping, and treats a failed start-receipt write as a startup failure that must clean up the unactivated process tree before returning control. A private marker is persisted before Codex `Popen` and upgraded with the creation identity before readiness; a spawn attempt without creation-bound stopped evidence is unconfirmed and cannot authorize fallback. The one-shot ordinary fallback bind resolves durable faults to either the prior claim or an exact re-barriered bound generation, verifies the returned digest/process receipt, and quarantines claimed or tentatively bound ambiguity instead of releasing it. Success or cancellation recovery requires a `codex-exit.json` record bound to the dispatched Codex PID/creation identity with exit code zero; missing, malformed, or identity-mismatched exit evidence carries a null/unknown code instead of a synthetic integer.

`start` and `activate` remain legacy-compatible diagnostics, but ordinary Build launch is the runner-owned `dispatch` operation: durable unactivated receipt → immediate activation of the same creation-bound run → durable activated receipt → return. No user message, wait, cancellation choice, repository action, or prompt release can interleave. Activation records privacy-safe `activated_at`, `observation_started_at`, and an immutable `observation_deadline_at` exactly 900 seconds later; `status` and `wait` expose those fields without changing registry schema.

Poll each owner-allocated run by passing its returned opaque `run_handle` to `agent_runner.py status --run-dir <handle>`; a controller that supplied a legacy explicit run path retains that path privately instead. Public receipts expose the handle plus prompt digest/classification, never the run directory, profile source, artifact paths, snapshot ID, or raw prompt bytes. For normal automatic orchestration, observe the same run with non-terminal `wait --soft-timeout-exit-zero` windows of `45`, then `90`, then `120` seconds, then the remaining time under one immutable 900-second observation budget. A soft timeout never releases a lease, changes profile, or starts a replacement. At the hard deadline, record hard-deadline evidence, call `cancel` automatically, and proceed only after full-tree stop proof; a valid completion recovered during cancellation follows ordinary finalization. A safe same-scope partial diff may use the existing root-completion authority but is never accepted as the worker handoff. The legacy strict `wait` exit code remains available by omitting `--soft-timeout-exit-zero`. Preserve the unactivated running receipt, record matching activation, then record the terminal receipt before consuming evidence. Accept a result only when the receipt reports `status: completed`, `dispatch_method: codex-exec-explicit-model`, the configured model and reasoning effort, a Codex PID/thread ID, terminal event `turn.completed`, a creation-bound Codex exit code of zero, a valid non-empty result, and a root-verified task outcome. A transport-success result that reports inability to complete the task is a failed handoff. A non-zero CLI exit other than the explicitly soft observation mode, malformed JSONL, `turn.failed`, missing terminal event, model/quota error, ChatGPT-auth failure, sandbox mismatch, or semantic failure stops that agent route and uses the phase-specific safe recovery without creating another agent. Build never asks whether to continue or cancel for this bounded same-scope operation.

Immediately before any recovery-capable activation, the registry re-captures and byte-compares the exact bound normal-source pre-snapshot or recovery-target candidate snapshot under its workspace lock. Snapshot capture holds non-following, identity-checked path objects through file hashing and directory enumeration; POSIX uses handle-relative `dir_fd` traversal, and Windows holds every component without delete sharing. Drift or a concurrent path swap records a durable unactivated abort, retains containment and never writes the prompt-gate artifact. For a successful recovery-capable implementation run, terminal receipt plus authenticated full-tree zero proof is not yet an accepted handoff and does not release the workspace. The root must reread the diff, verify allowed paths, rerun the primary/focused checks, compute the lowercase SHA-256 digest of its canonical verification receipt, and call the private `_finalize-success --run-dir <path> --primary-signal-digest <digest>` transition. Only its durable handoff outbox, authenticated guardian close, privacy-safe terminal archive, and registry release authorize result consumption and specification/version edits. A failed contained source run produces no handoff. After terminal stop proof, an eligible safe same-scope partial diff may continue through the already-authorized automatic root-completion branch. Only a new recovery target writer requires explicit user opt-in. Bind that explicit new-writer action to a canonical `user-action-digest`, reserve exactly one target with the private `_authorize-recovery` transition, then dispatch the reserved run directory with the same structured checkpoint tuple. Never print private nonces or registry paths, never auto-authorize a recovery writer, and never give a recovery target an ordinary-process fallback.

Terminal reconciliation derives the expected run ID through the same owner helper for current normal leases and recovery-target plans, requires it to equal the reconciled private directory name before any terminal transition, and includes that opaque run ID in terminal evidence. Prompt blob, private `prompt.md`, and `request.json` bindings cross file-sync, write-through replace, post-replace rebarrier, and parent-metadata barriers before authority/release; durable run binding and terminal release invoke reference-aware GC, while live grant/lease references always outrank release tombstones. GC rebarriers and schema-validates every private source before classification, and malformed state fails closed without deletion. Every recovery-target terminal outcome retires its consumed prompt authorization through the replay-safe source/registry boundary before GC. Closed outcome reports use the executable owner classifier for exactly one of `decision-required`, `blocked`, `automation-exhausted`, or `terminal-abandoned`; public failure detail stays private behind closed classifications. Before root-only completion, call private `_record-root-completion` to persist the privacy-safe authority/scope/diff audit after exact vacancy and no-handoff release.

While an implementation registry is non-vacant, the root performs no workspace write at all, including specification, version, changelog, prompt, ignored, or Git-owned artifacts. If the stopped transport-success lifecycle has authenticated full-tree zero, no handoff/outbox, and revalidation returns the exact reason set `[outside-set-drift]`, call private `_reconcile-terminal-abandonment --run-dir <path>` automatically. Its owner-derived `terminal-abandonment-v1` transition invalidates the source checkpoint, records a privacy-safe abandoned archive, closes the existing guardian, and releases that same lease; it never creates a grant, retry, escalation, run, writer, or accepted handoff. Mixed/unknown reasons, identity or containment ambiguity, live processes, quarantine, or a binding mismatch remain fail-closed without force-unlock.

After vacancy, the original `run`, `full`, or implementation-targeted `auto` request is standing authority for root-only same-revision, same-milestone, same-allowed-scope completion when the stopped partial diff is independently attributable, the root meets the risk floor, and no user-owned decision is required. Record `root-completion-authorized` before editing. Use `decision-required` only for a material `product|architecture|scope|permissions|privacy|security|destructive|external-action|publication` choice, with `required_action=provide-decision`; use `blocked` for missing or ambiguous safety/process/containment/ownership evidence; use `automation-exhausted` only when every safe executor/route under existing authority is exhausted. None starts a writer, and an evidence state must never be reframed as a permission question. A new recovery writer still requires the existing explicit one-shot user opt-in, eligible immutable checkpoint, exact allowed set/revision, and vacancy.

## Maintain the agent activity ledger

Append one durable row when Build actually creates any search, critic, implementation, or review agent through the exact runner. Count logical runs, not operating-system processes: a wrapper and its child `codex exec` are one logical run. Pre-spawn dispatch failures do not increment the created-run count; list them separately when they changed routing. Once created, a run remains visible when its result is unusable, cancelled, or timed out.

For every created run record its role and task, actual model and reasoning effort from the exact runner receipt, terminal and semantic outcome, a short factual description of completed work, and its AC, milestone, or specification-section mapping (or `none`). A pre-spawn failure is listed separately and does not create a ledger row. Keep PID, thread/run paths, raw prompts, logs, token/usage values, and authentication details out of the user-facing ledger and final answer.

## Select the specification safely

Use an explicit path when supplied and verify that it exists before `refine`, `run`, or path-based `auto`. Otherwise:

1. Prefer a relevant existing `BUILD.md`.
2. Then consider a relevant `SPEC.md` or `TZ.md`.
3. For `new`, `full`, or `auto` with a new idea, create `<project-root>/BUILD.md` when no relevant file exists.

For `refine` or `run`, stop and request a valid path when no relevant specification exists or a supplied explicit path does not exist. Before changing an existing candidate, read it and confirm that it belongs to the current task. When several candidates are relevant or a file belongs to another task, ask which file to use or propose a descriptive `BUILD-<name>.md`. Never silently replace an unrelated document.

Read [the specification template](references/spec-template.md) before creating or materially restructuring a specification.

Read [the specification readiness protocol](references/blindspot-protocol.md), then record the workflow target and first incomplete phase. Explicit modes and paths override inference. A legacy `Ready` file without the current decision memory, coverage ledger, and closure evidence returns to readiness audit before implementation.

Before the first product question or material restructuring, build the specification source map required by the readiness protocol. Inventory the selected root document and every in-scope normative file it links to, includes, or names as a companion; read those sources, record every outgoing normative edge with discovery evidence, record their authority and decision provenance, and preserve resolved choices found anywhere in that graph. The map is complete only when every edge target is mapped and every source is reachable from the root. Do not assume that the root file overrides a linked specification. An unreadable, ambiguous, or conflicting normative source remains a gap.

## Apply non-negotiable boundaries

- Obey all applicable `AGENTS.md`, repository policies, sandbox rules, and approval requirements.
- Treat current files and user edits as authoritative. Preserve unrelated changes and exclude them from edits, review, commits, and pushes.
- Keep the root agent as the owner of the interview, recommendations, evidence verification, outcome-neutral technical decisions, specification and version edits after the applicable decision gate, finding adjudication, validation choices, Git, and final synthesis. The user owns material product decisions and architecture/provider choices that cross the product-impact boundary. Lease implementation edits only through [adaptive implementation delegation](references/implementation-delegation.md).
- Keep search workers, specification critics, and reviewers read-only. Permit only the selected risk-matched implementation worker to edit its leased file set; it never makes product or architecture decisions, changes the specification/version, or controls Git.
- Allow only one active writer in the shared workspace. The root does not edit while a worker lease is active, and multiple implementation workers run sequentially with a root handoff gate between them.
- Route every repository lookup through [code discovery](references/code-discovery.md) and its separate-pool-first order. Keep only direct reads of explicit, runtime-provided, or already-known `path:line` targets with the root.
- Keep reviewers read-only. Route confirmed behavioral findings through [the TDD workflow](references/tdd-workflow.md) under root ownership instead of asking a reviewer to edit.
- Before milestone or final commits, follow [versioning](references/versioning.md). In a versioned repository, give every Build-created commit a unique higher version unless an applicable repository policy explicitly defines a different release-only scheme.
- Never infer a model's cost or capability from its slug. Report a selected model or tier only when the runtime or confirmed configuration exposes it.
- Never alter user-level or project-level model configuration without showing the exact proposed changes and receiving separate permission.
- In `new`, `refine`, and specification-targeted `auto`, do not edit implementation files, run destructive commands, or begin milestones.
- During `run`, `full`, and implementation-targeted `auto`, make milestone commits when Git is available, task changes can be isolated, and repository/user instructions do not forbid commits. Never push without explicit authorization.
- Never print or commit secret values, tokens, passwords, cookies, private keys, customer data, raw `.env` contents, or credential-bearing remote URLs. Inspect only the metadata needed for the task and redact credentials from durable specifications, logs, reviews, and reports.
- Stop before destructive or irreversible actions, secrets, purchases, live infrastructure, external publication without existing authorization, or material scope expansion.

## Establish the baseline

Before discovery or edits:

1. Find the project root and applicable instructions.
2. Inspect the current Git branch, `HEAD`, staged/unstaged/untracked state, remotes, version/release sources, and available validation entry points.
3. Record a durable review baseline in the specification. For Git, include `branch@SHA` and a concise initial status. For non-Git work, record the in-scope artifact manifest and hashes when practical. On continuation of the same task, preserve the original baseline instead of replacing it with the latest milestone.
4. Mark pre-existing or unrelated changes as out of scope.
5. On continuation, reread the specification and current project state instead of relying on chat memory. If the original baseline is absent, recover it from the parent of the first identifiable task commit when evidence permits; otherwise record the earliest verifiable boundary and the resulting review limitation.

## Discover repository evidence

Search only areas that can change the decision. Establish:

- current observable behavior and the owning source of truth;
- relevant data, state, request, or event flow;
- contracts, constraints, similar implementations, and compatibility requirements;
- real test and validation commands;
- affected users, data, integrations, security boundaries, and rollout concerns;
- the concrete mismatch between the requested result and the current project.

Read [code discovery](references/code-discovery.md) before any repository grep, file discovery, symbol lookup, dependency tracing, route mapping, test/config/schema search, or log scan. Create a compact search plan, then use [model routing](references/model-routing.md): resolve the effective discovery map and dispatch its first exact agent. Advance one route step only after a semantically completed result contains a configured evidence trigger. If transport or exact selection fails, create no replacement agent and use only the minimum targeted root search needed to unblock the task. Never invent pool membership, quota, model switching, strength, or savings.

Put independent search branches into the single exact worker's bounded prompt when useful. Require a compact evidence map with `path:line`, symbol or route, confirmed fact, relevance, negative results, and confidence. Aggregate and deduplicate the map, then let the root perform targeted verification. Give the exact run a task-appropriate time and single-attempt budget. A short parent polling timeout is not a completed worker failure. After a confirmed terminal failure, confirmed cancellation at the declared budget, or a semantically unusable result, create no second discovery attempt and transition directly to targeted root recovery.

## Classify the implementation mode

Before implementation, assign and record one mode using [the TDD workflow](references/tdd-workflow.md):

- `Direct` for documentation, cosmetic, or obvious local edits without behavior changes;
- `Investigation` while the root cause or owning layer is unclear;
- `TDD-first` for behavior, logic, contracts, auth or permissions, persistence, routing, state, concurrency, integrations, security, or non-trivial user-visible changes.

Do not force a failing test for Direct work. Reclassify Investigation work to TDD-first before changing behavior.

## Classify complexity and risk

Assign `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `critical` before implementation and record the reasons in the specification. Use the highest applicable risk, not an average.

- `low`: documentation, copy, styling, or a local mechanical change without behavior changes.
- `medium`: contained logic or refactoring with clear contracts and supported tests.
- `high`: cross-layer behavior, public contracts, persistence, concurrency, authentication, authorization, privacy, or sensitive state/data flow.
- `critical`: irreversible changes, live infrastructure, secrets or permissions, destructive migrations, or very high blast radius.

Authentication, permissions, secrets, persistence, migrations, concurrency, and public contracts set a conservative minimum tier. Reclassify when discovery or the diff expands scope.

## Audit blind spots

Follow [the specification readiness protocol](references/blindspot-protocol.md). Build a complete specification source map, durable coverage ledger, user decision memory with stable `D-###` IDs, outcome-neutral technical decision ledger with stable `T-###` IDs, and a risk-adaptive fresh critic loop for every non-trivial specification. Treat critic findings and their labels only as candidates: the root verifies evidence, applies the product-impact test, resolves repository facts and only outcome-neutral technical gaps, deduplicates semantic matches, and asks the user about every remaining material choice.

## Protect user decision authority

The user owns any choice that crosses the product-impact boundary by changing observable product behavior, UX, eligibility or audience, age/platform/geography availability, permissions, privacy or data lifecycle, monetization/economy/rewards, safety/moderation/legal gates, compatibility, cost, rollout, acceptance criteria, or scope. The same rule applies to an architecture or provider choice when it changes those outcomes or creates material lock-in. Repository, legal, security, and platform evidence may rule out an impossible option or change the recommendation, but it does not authorize the root to choose a remaining product outcome.

Classify a decision as autonomous technical work only when it selects an implementation mechanism that preserves every resolved `D-###`, user-authored requirement, acceptance criterion, invariant, and observable outcome. Record it as `T-###` with that preservation evidence. If the classification is mixed or uncertain, treat it as a user-owned `D-###`. A critic's `technical decision` label is never sufficient authority by itself.

When normative sources conflict, preserve each source and its provenance, link the conflict to an existing `D-###` or create a new open one, and ask the user. Never silently prefer the root document, the critic recommendation, the safer default, or the easiest implementation. A conflict may close without a new question only when an already-mapped authority record explicitly names the precedence/supersession relation, target, revision, and line. Initial source mapping cannot self-declare a user deferral. A resolved decision may be propagated to inconsistent dependent documents only when the edit preserves that exact decision; changing it requires evidence-backed reopening and a new user answer.

## Ask product questions before normative edits

Ask only open or evidence-backed reopened decisions that cross the product-impact boundary. Do not ask for facts available in the repository or repeat a resolved decision under different wording. A later answer cannot replace a locked `D-###` until the same ID has an explicit `decision-reopened` transition with evidence.

Ask up to five questions per round using simple mutually exclusive options:

```text
1. [D-###] <question in plain language>
   Context: <current requirement or conflict and its source>
   a) <option and user-visible consequence>
   b) <option and user-visible consequence>
   c) <option and user-visible consequence>
   Risks: <material risk or trade-off for the options>
   Affected product map: <requirements, specifications, acceptance criteria, or milestones likely to change>
   Recommendation: 1a — <short reason>.

Reply with: 1a 2b 3c. A custom answer is also valid.
```

Show each stable `D-###` ID, the current decision or conflict provenance, mutually exclusive options, user-visible consequences, material risks, the affected product-map areas, and a reasoned recommendation; put the recommended choice first and keep the reply format short. Before waiting, update only the specification source map, evidence, coverage, open/reopened decision records, pending proposals, risk register, and question log. Do not change normative specification content—requirements, scope, non-goals, product behavior, UX, permissions, data policy, monetization, acceptance criteria, roadmap, milestones, or linked normative files—on the basis of an open or reopened decision. Partial answers close only their referenced IDs.

After the user answers, apply exactly the resolved `D-###` choices across the root and dependent specifications, then rebuild the affected product map, requirements, acceptance criteria, and milestones. Record a decision application receipt mapping each applied ID to its exact current answer source and selected outcome, changed files/sections/criteria, preserved decisions, and remaining open IDs. A reopened decision invalidates the prior write/application authorization for that ID and requires fresh application of every previously affected target/change tuple. A user-confirmed no-op is valid only when the user repeats the pre-reopen outcome and the receipt covers that entire tuple set. If application or a later critic exposes another product-impacting choice, start another interview round and keep the status at `Questions`; do not silently resolve it or advance to `Ready`.

## Reach the Ready gate

Require the specification to contain:

- workflow target, starting phase, and current specification revision;
- user outcome, scope, and exclusions;
- repository evidence, a complete specification source map, and source of truth;
- durable user-owned `D-###` decisions and outcome-neutral `T-###` technical decisions with provenance and reopen history;
- a complete evidence-backed coverage ledger and adjudicated critic log;
- observable acceptance criteria and invariants;
- failure modes, edge cases, compatibility, security, data, rollout, and rollback concerns;
- complexity class and model-routing mode;
- version source, policy, and expected version impact, or why versioning is not applicable;
- primary signal, validation strategy, coherent milestones, and review plan;
- a current decision application receipt for every Build-made normative change after the latest answer;
- no gaps, blocking product decisions, contradictions, missing authority, or unapproved normative changes.

Require the risk-appropriate critic depth and a fresh `COVERED` closure verdict for the current specification revision. Do not claim literal omniscience; require closure across every defined and task-specific concern with evidence or a justified `not applicable` disposition.

In `new`, `refine`, or specification-targeted `auto`, set the specification to `Ready`, summarize the applied and preserved decisions, and stop. In `run`, `full`, or implementation-targeted `auto`, set it to `Ready` and immediately continue only after the decision authority and application gates pass, unless the user requested a checkpoint or the risk/authority policy requires one.

## Implement milestones

For each milestone:

1. Reconfirm its acceptance criteria, implementation mode, complexity floor, and owning files.
2. Read and apply [the minimality protocol](references/minimality-protocol.md) before the first code change. Record which rung is selected, what complexity is skipped, and any known ceiling with its observable upgrade trigger.
3. Select `root-only`, `bounded-worker`, or `sequential-workers` through [adaptive implementation delegation](references/implementation-delegation.md). For a bounded writer, run `model_map.py resolve --use-case implementation --risk <classified-risk>` and use the first returned exact profile. Validate it, acquire and record the single-writer lease, then launch it through runner-owned `dispatch` in `scripts/agent_runner.py`. The runner records the unactivated `running` receipt, immediately activates that exact run, and returns the durable activated receipt; the root records its lease/run-bound `implementation-agent-activated` event before the first edit. The worker receives no task prompt and cannot edit before activation. Keep the lease active through every worker edit, then require `codex-exec-explicit-model`, terminal `turn.completed`, creation-bound exit code zero, valid result evidence, and semantic task success in the final receipt before recording the run-bound `implementation-handoff-accepted` event, consuming the result, and releasing the lease. A matching failed/cancelled terminal receipt with complete independent exit/result failure evidence and a confirmed stopped process tree permits lease release but keeps the milestone incomplete and forbids accepted handoff or another writer route except for the exact automatic actions defined by the delegation contract. Pass the exact canonical ID through `agent_name` and a separate descriptive `task_name`. Keep one active writer, preserve the same TDD/minimality/validation gates at every route step, and record the model-map source/hash, requested profile, concrete model/effort evidence, escalation, and lease. Escalate only on task evidence: a completed worker may return `NEEDS_ESCALATION` with a configured trigger before any edit, after which the root may approve exactly the next configured route step and issue a new lease. Infrastructure, authentication, quota, sandbox, spawn, runner, transport, or evidence failure never authorizes escalation. Once any edit occurs, the same writer must finish that milestone. If the exact route cannot be selected, stop rather than lower the risk floor.
   A transport-completed result whose semantics are `BLOCKED` or a verified zero-write `NEEDS_ESCALATION` is not a successful handoff. The root must record it through private `_reject-handoff --disposition blocked|needs-escalation --evidence-digest <sha256>` instead of `_finalize-success`. That durable transition suppresses the handoff outbox and rejects replay or later success finalization. For `needs-escalation`, rejection first persists `checkpoint_invalidation=pending`; reconciliation idempotently invalidates the source and published checkpoint, then binds `completed` in the workspace registry. Any invalidation/artifact failure returns failure and retains the lease. Only registry-bound completion permits authenticated containment close, lease release, and the next configured route step.
4. For TDD-first work, follow [the TDD workflow](references/tdd-workflow.md): establish the owner and primary signal, run the smallest meaningful red test when practical, then implement the minimum coherent owner-layer change.
5. For Direct or Investigation work, use the narrow signal appropriate to that mode and reclassify before changing behavior.
6. After every worker handoff, let the root verify the complete diff and rerun focused validation independently.
7. Require focused green validation, refactor only after green when it removes current complexity, then run wider checks according to risk.
8. Review the task diff against the saved baseline. Revert only accidental out-of-scope edits made by Build during this task; leave pre-existing or user-owned unrelated changes untouched and exclude them from review and commits.
9. Apply [versioning](references/versioning.md): classify the version impact, update required version/changelog/documentation surfaces in the same commit, and validate their agreement. Use `not applicable` only when there is no authoritative version source or no commit will be created.
10. Run the built-in progressive review described in [the review protocol](references/review-protocol.md) against the complete diff, including versioning changes.
11. Adjudicate every finding. Fix confirmed actionable issues, rerun affected validation, and repeat review whenever remediation or version synchronization changes the reviewed diff.
12. Close the milestone only when its primary signal is met, validation is green, acceptance coverage is complete, and no actionable finding remains.
13. Update milestone status, evidence, delegation, review mode/tier, and validation log in the specification.
14. Create a scoped milestone commit when allowed and safe. Do not include unrelated changes and do not push without explicit authorization.

## Run progressive review

Read [the review protocol](references/review-protocol.md) for `run`, `full`, and implementation-targeted `auto`.

Build the ordered ladder by running `model_map.py resolve --use-case review --risk <classified-risk>` and run each returned reviewer only through `scripts/agent_runner.py` as `codex-exec-explicit-model`. Launch the first returned exact reviewer through runner-owned `dispatch`; it durably records the unactivated `running` Review routing receipt, immediately activates that exact run, and returns its activated receipt. Persist the model-map source/hash and route step, record the matching `review-agent-activated` event from those receipts, and consume the result only after a stopped terminal receipt proves `turn.completed`, creation-bound exit code zero, valid result evidence, and a semantically completed review with unchanged route/process identities. Exact review transport failure blocks the review/release gate; root self-review may diagnose but cannot close it without a new explicit user override.

Run reviewers strictly in the configured sequence and stop at its `max_steps`. Stop on an evidence-backed `ACCEPT` with sufficient confidence, complete coverage, green validation, and no actionable finding. Move exactly one route step only when a configured concrete trigger remains after root adjudication, TDD/minimality remediation, and affected green validation. Never fan out reviewers, skip a configured step, repeat a step on an unchanged diff, or let a reviewer edit.

Use a fresh reviewer context with history inheritance disabled when the runtime supports it, such as `fork_turns: "none"` or an equivalent `fork_context: false`. If isolation controls are unavailable, disclose that the context may be inherited and do not claim full independence. Pass the specification, preserved original baseline, current full task diff, validation evidence, and acceptance criteria without leaking earlier reviewer conclusions.

Require a structured result containing verdict, confidence, acceptance coverage, evidence-backed findings, observed routing mode/tier, and an optional score. Low confidence, incomplete coverage, conflicting reviews, failed validation, unresolved high-impact findings, or a material post-review diff triggers escalation after confirmed findings are handled. A score below `9.5` triggers escalation only when the reviewer ties it to a concrete finding, uncertainty, or coverage gap.

For TDD-first milestones, require the reviewer to audit the red signal, owning layer, focused green result, and risk-based coverage without editing. The root verifies confirmed findings and sends behavioral remediation back through the TDD workflow before the next review cycle.

Treat scores only as secondary escalation signals. An evidence-backed `ACCEPT` with green validation, complete acceptance coverage, sufficient confidence, and no actionable findings is enough even when an optional score is omitted or below `9.5` without a concrete gap. Never accept work from a number alone. Bound the loop by the distinct available tiers and do not repeat the same reviewer on an unchanged diff. A clean balanced review may close high-risk work; move to strong only on a concrete remaining trigger. Strongest is required directly for critical work and may be used after strong only to resolve a final material dispute. If the runtime cannot prove the required exact tier, keep the review and release gate incomplete.

If the strongest required reviewer still finds blocking issues, keep the task incomplete and record the exact blocker. A root self-review may diagnose failures but never substitutes for the required exact reviewer or claims independence.

## Configure the model map

For `$build configure-models` or its backward-compatible `$build setup-models` alias, read [the model-map interview](references/model-map-interview.md) and [model routing](references/model-routing.md), then run the interview instead of starting a Build task.

Ask the adaptive question blocks in plain language, recommend the safe packaged starting point first, and cover discovery, specification critics, implementation, review, escalation steps, reasoning effort, usage constraints, and critical work. Collect one complete project- or user-scoped map. Before writing, show the exact target files and diff, validate every safety invariant, and request explicit permission. Never silently overwrite or merge existing configuration.

After permission, write the complete map and necessary exact profile overrides, run `model_map.py validate`, then run one launcher smoke per distinct model/effort/sandbox tuple when the selected models are available. If setup is declined, keep the packaged defaults unchanged. If a configured route cannot be selected and complete semantically through the exact runner, apply the phase-specific blocked or targeted-root recovery rule; never create an unverified replacement agent.

## Complete the workflow

After all milestones:

1. Run relevant end-to-end validation.
2. Review the full task diff against the saved baseline with a fresh reviewer at the minimum final tier.
3. Verify every acceptance criterion with authoritative evidence.
4. Check documentation, version impact, compatibility, migration, rollout/rollback, security, and remaining risks.
5. Fix confirmed gaps and repeat affected checks and review.
6. Set `Complete` only when every requirement is proven. Otherwise preserve the exact status and continue or request missing authority.
7. Update the final specification log and agent activity ledger, then create the final scoped commit when allowed. Push only when explicitly authorized.

Report the outcome, workflow route, specification revision and critic closure, specification source map, asked/resolved/preserved/reopened decisions, decision application receipt, closed milestones, search usage route and circuit breaker, requested implementation profile/tier, exact runner model/effort evidence or a pre-spawn failure, escalation and delegation, red/green evidence, minimality decisions, version impact and before/after version, acceptance evidence, validation, review mode/tier, commits, documentation status, migration implications, and real remaining risks.

End every completed Build response with a concise localized agent section. Use `Agents` for an English response and `Агенты` for a Russian response. State the number of actually created logical agent runs, list pre-spawn dispatch failures separately, and include one table row per ledger run with `Role/task`, `Actual model/effort`, `Status/outcome`, `Work`, and `AC/milestone/spec mapping`. Every created-agent row comes from an exact runner receipt; never invent missing model evidence.
