Improve test coverage for **$ARGUMENTS** by mining reference test suites from yash, GNU coreutils, and uutils/coreutils for gaps in our scenario tests.

## ⛔ STOP — READ THIS BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE ⛔

You MUST follow this execution protocol. Skipping steps causes missed coverage gaps or broken tests.

**IMPORTANT: Never ask the user questions or wait for confirmation. Always process ALL targets autonomously from start to finish.**

### Do NOT stop the run voluntarily

Once started, continue through every ⏳ target until Phase C completes. Resume-via-`COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md` is for actual crashes/interrupts, not for voluntary pauses.

Do **not**:

- Stop because you "feel low on context budget." The harness auto-compresses prior messages; you don't run out, you just lose old details. Each per-target commit is a self-contained checkpoint.
- Stop because the run is "taking long" or has used "many tool calls." The user invoked `all` knowing the scope.
- Ask the user whether to continue, or emit a "session checkpoint / resume next time" mid-run summary. If you're typing those words, you're violating the protocol.
- Jump to Phase C before every target reaches ✅ or ⏭️.

Valid halts before Phase C: explicit user interrupt, or an unrecoverable hard failure (e.g. push rejected, repo broken). Otherwise: when one target finishes, the next action is the next target's Step 4. The per-target commit + PR comment **is** the user-visible progress — no separate status update needed.

### 1. Create the full task list FIRST

Your very first action — before reading ANY files, before writing ANY code — is to create the task list. Call TaskCreate for each step:

1. "Step 1: Enumerate all targets (or resume from COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md)"
2. "Step 2: Initialize COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md"
3. "Step 3: Download reference test suites"

Then for each target discovered in Step 1, you will dynamically create tasks for the per-target loop (Steps 4–11). After all targets are processed, three finalization tasks run once:

- "Step 12: Run /fix-ci-tests to clear CI failures"
- "Step 13: Post final coverage report to PR"
- "Step 14: Remove COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md from the PR"

### 2. Execution order

The workflow has three phases:

**Phase A — Setup (once):** Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3

**Phase B — Per-target loop:** Process targets ONE AT A TIME, in sequence. For each target, run Steps 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 11 sequentially. Complete ALL steps for one target before starting the next. Do NOT process multiple targets in parallel.

**Phase C — Finalization (once, after all targets):** Step 12 → Step 13 → Step 14.

Before starting step N, call TaskList and verify step N-1 is `completed`. Set step N to `in_progress`.

Before marking any step as `completed`:
- Re-read the step description and verify every sub-bullet is satisfied
- If any sub-bullet is not done, keep working — do NOT mark it completed

### 3. Progress tracking and resumability

`COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md` (at the repo root) is the durable progress tracker for this skill. It is committed to the branch on every per-target iteration so a crashed/interrupted run can be resumed cleanly. It is **deleted** in the final commit of Phase C — it is a working document, not part of the merged change set.

**On every invocation of this skill, the very first thing you do (before TaskCreate) is check whether `COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md` exists at the repo root.**

```bash
test -f COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md && echo "RESUME" || echo "FRESH"
```

- If it exists → **resume mode**: read it, identify the next ⏳ pending target, and skip Step 1's enumeration. Jump straight to Step 2 (verifying/refreshing the file) and Step 3 (downloads), then resume the per-target loop at the first pending row.
- If it does not exist → **fresh mode**: proceed normally with Step 1.

---

## Context

The safe shell interpreter (`interp/`) implements all commands as Go builtins — it never executes host binaries. Test scenarios are YAML files in `tests/scenarios/` that are automatically validated against both the shell and bash (via Docker).

### Reference test suites

Three external test suites serve as coverage references:

1. **yash** — a POSIX-compliant shell with thorough tests for shell language features (control flow, expansion, quoting, redirections, etc.)
   - Repository: https://github.com/magicant/yash/tree/trunk/tests
   - License: GPL v2; use for test **design** reference only, not verbatim copy
   - Strengths: POSIX shell language edge cases, quoting, expansion, control flow

2. **GNU coreutils** — reference implementation tests for command-line utilities
   - Repository: https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/tree/master/tests
   - License: GPL v3; use for test **design** reference only
   - Offline: `resources/gnu-coreutils-tests/`
   - Strengths: flag combinations, edge cases, error handling, multi-file behavior

3. **uutils/coreutils** — Rust rewrite of coreutils with MIT-licensed tests
   - Repository: https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/tree/main/tests
   - License: MIT; test logic can be freely adapted
   - Offline: `resources/uutils-tests/`
   - Strengths: integer edge cases, Unicode, binary input, overflow guards, cross-platform

### How to decide which suite to consult

| Target | Primary suite | Secondary suite |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| Shell language features (control flow, expansion, quoting, redirections, etc.) | yash | — |
| Builtin commands (cat, head, grep, etc.) | GNU coreutils + uutils | yash (for piping/integration) |
| Both | All three | — |

---

## Phase A — Setup

### Step 1: Enumerate all targets (or resume)

**Resume short-circuit:** if `COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md` already exists, do NOT re-enumerate. Parse the existing target table from the file and use that as the authoritative ordered target list. Skip the rest of this step and move to Step 2.

Otherwise (fresh run), based on the argument (`$ARGUMENTS`), build the ordered list of targets to process:

- **A specific command** (e.g. `cat`, `head`, `grep`): The target list is just that one command. Verify it exists as an implemented builtin by checking `interp/builtins/`.
- **A shell feature** (e.g. `var_expand`, `globbing`, `pipe`): The target list is just that one feature. Verify the directory exists in `tests/scenarios/shell/`.
- **`all`**: Enumerate **every** command and shell feature:

```bash
# List all implemented builtin commands
ls interp/builtins/ | grep -v _test.go | sed 's/\.go$//' | sort

# List all shell feature test directories
ls tests/scenarios/shell/ | sort

# List all command test directories
ls tests/scenarios/cmd/ | sort
```

For each target, count its current scenario tests and note the count. Sort targets by test count ascending (fewest tests first) to prioritize the least-covered targets.

Log the full target list as a table (do NOT ask for confirmation — always process all targets):

| # | Target | Type | Current tests | Reference suites |
|---|--------|------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1 | ... | cmd/shell | N | GNU+uutils / yash |

Then immediately create tasks for the per-target loop. For each target, call TaskCreate for:
- "Step 4: Audit existing coverage — <target>"
- "Step 5: Identify coverage gaps — <target>"
- "Step 6: Write new tests (scenario preferred, unit when needed) — <target>"
- "Step 7: Prune duplicate and low-value tests (unit + scenario) — <target>"
- "Step 8: Review skip_assert_against_bash flags — <target>"
- "Step 9: Review unnecessary Windows-specific assertions — <target>"
- "Step 10: Fix failing tests — <target>"
- "Step 11: Commit, push, update COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md, post per-target report — <target>"

Set up blockedBy dependencies so each target's Step 4 is blocked by the previous target's Step 11 (and by Step 3 for the first target). Step 12 is blocked by the final target's Step 11; Step 13 is blocked by Step 12; Step 14 is blocked by Step 13.

### Step 2: Initialize COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md

Create or refresh `COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md` at the repo root. This file is committed to the branch and used to resume an interrupted run. It is removed in the finalization phase.

If you are resuming (the file already existed), validate that the table contents still match the present targets and update only the header date if needed — do NOT overwrite per-target status from a fresh enumeration.

If you are starting fresh, write the file using this template:

```markdown
# Coverage Improvement Progress

Tracking progress of `/improve-test-coverage <ARGUMENTS>` run started YYYY-MM-DD.

## Target list (sorted by current test count, ascending)

Legend: ⏳ pending · 🔄 in progress · ✅ done · ⏭️ skipped (no high-value gaps)

| # | Target | Type | Tests (before) | Tests (after) | Status | Notes |
|---|--------|------|---------------:|--------------:|--------|-------|
| 1 | <target> | cmd/shell | <N> | — | ⏳ | |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ⏳ | |

## Summary

- Targets processed: 0 / <total>
- Tests added: 0 (scenario: 0, unit: 0)
- Duplicate tests removed: 0 (scenario: 0, unit: 0)
- Low-value tests removed: 0 (scenario: 0, unit: 0)
- `skip_assert_against_bash` flags removed: 0
- Windows-specific assertions removed: 0
```

Then commit the initial state to the branch (subsequent updates are folded into each target's commit in Step 11):

```bash
git add COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md
git commit -m "chore: initialize COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md for /improve-test-coverage run

Tracking file for /improve-test-coverage. This file is committed during
the run for resumability and removed in the finalization commit.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
git push || git push -u origin "$(git branch --show-current)"
```

If resuming, no commit is needed at this step — the file is already on the branch.

### Step 3: Download reference test suites

Download all reference suites once, before starting the per-target loop.

#### For builtin commands

First check if offline resources exist:

```bash
ls resources/gnu-coreutils-tests/ 2>/dev/null | head -5
ls resources/uutils-tests/ 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

If offline resources are available, use them. Otherwise download:

```bash
# GNU coreutils tests
curl -sL https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz | tar -xz -C /tmp
# Tests are at: /tmp/coreutils-master/tests/<command>/

# uutils tests
curl -sL https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz | tar -xz -C /tmp
# Tests are at: /tmp/coreutils-main/tests/by-util/test_<command>.rs
```

#### For shell features

Download the yash test suite:

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/magicant/yash/archive/refs/heads/trunk.tar.gz | tar -xz -C /tmp
# Tests are at: /tmp/yash-trunk/tests/
```

Only download the suites needed for the targets in the list. If all targets are commands, skip yash (unless needed for integration patterns). If all targets are shell features, skip GNU/uutils.

---

## Phase B — Per-target loop

For each target in the ordered list from Step 1, execute Steps 4–11 sequentially. Replace `<target>` below with the current command or shell feature name.

**Before starting Step 4 for a target**, mark its row in `COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md` as `🔄` (in progress). This change is folded into the target's Step 11 commit; no separate commit is required.

### Step 4: Audit existing coverage

Audit **both** layers and treat them as one body of coverage — a behavior tested in either layer counts as covered.

```bash
# Scenario tests (YAML)
find tests/scenarios/cmd/<target>/ tests/scenarios/shell/<target>/ -name "*.yaml" 2>/dev/null | sort

# Go unit tests
find interp/builtins/ -path "*<target>*_test.go" 2>/dev/null | sort
find interp/builtins/tests/<target>/ -name "*_test.go" 2>/dev/null | sort
find interp/ -name "builtin_<target>*_test.go" 2>/dev/null | sort
```

For each test (YAML file or `func Test…` / table row), note the flag/behavior it exercises, whether it covers happy path / edge / error, and any `skip_assert_against_bash` or build-tag constraints. Build a single coverage matrix listing each behavior and which layer(s) cover it.

Read the relevant reference test files from the suites downloaded in Step 3 (GNU coreutils + uutils for commands, yash for shell features and integration patterns).

### Step 5: Identify coverage gaps

Cross-reference the reference test suites **and our internal API surface** against existing coverage (Step 4, both layers) to find gaps.

#### Gap categories to look for

**User-visible behavior (commands):**

| Category | What to check |
|----------|--------------|
| **Untested flags** | Flags that are implemented but have no test (scenario or unit) exercising them |
| **Flag combinations** | Pairs/triples of flags used together (reference suites often test these) |
| **Edge case inputs** | Empty file, single-line file, no trailing newline, binary input, very long lines |
| **Error conditions** | Missing file, directory as argument, permission denied, invalid flag values |
| **stdin behavior** | Command reading from pipe vs file, `-` as filename, interactive vs non-interactive |
| **Multi-file behavior** | Multiple file arguments, mix of valid and invalid files, header formatting |
| **Numeric boundaries** | Zero, one, large values, negative values (where applicable) |
| **Special characters** | Filenames with spaces, newlines, Unicode, glob characters |

**User-visible behavior (shell features):**

| Category | What to check |
|----------|--------------|
| **Quoting edge cases** | Nested quotes, escaped characters in different quoting contexts |
| **Expansion edge cases** | Unset variables, empty variables, special parameters ($?, $#, $@, $*) |
| **Control flow edge cases** | Empty bodies, nested loops, break/continue with counts |
| **Redirection edge cases** | Multiple redirections, fd duplication, here-documents with expansion |
| **Error handling** | Syntax errors, failed commands in pipelines, exit codes from control structures |
| **Word splitting** | IFS variations, empty fields, splitting with special characters |
| **Globbing** | No matches, dot files, special patterns, escaped glob characters |

**Internal behavior (unit-test-only candidates):** typed errors, goroutine context propagation, sandbox API contracts, build-tag-gated platform behavior, resource limits, parser invariants — anything not observable through stdout/stderr/exit-code. See the Step 6 layer-selection table for the full rubric.

#### Filtering

Skip candidate gaps that:
- Test flags we intentionally do not implement (check the builtin's doc comment or `--help` output)
- Test write/execute operations that our sandbox blocks
- Test platform-specific kernel features (`/proc`, `/sys`, inotify) we don't implement
- Test GNU-specific extensions beyond POSIX that we don't support
- Rely on external commands we don't implement
- Are **already covered in either layer** — a behavior tested by a Go unit test is just as covered as one tested by a scenario, and vice versa. Do not propose a duplicate scenario test for something a Go test already pins down (and do not propose a Go test for something a scenario already pins down) unless Step 6's layer-selection rubric independently justifies the second layer.

#### High-value filter

For every surviving gap, write one sentence on why a regression would break real scripts (for user-visible gaps) or break an internal contract that scripts depend on indirectly (for internal gaps). If you can't, drop it.

#### Priority

Rank surviving gaps. Only **P1/P2** are eligible by default:

1. **P1 — Critical missing coverage**: core flag or load-bearing behavior has zero coverage anywhere.
2. **P2 — Important edge case**: real-world edge case (empty input, stdin pipe, multi-file) for a load-bearing flag.
3. **P3/P4 — Nice-to-have / speculative**: **default skip.**

Log the analysis as a table with: gap, priority, regression-impact sentence, decision (add/skip + reason), **proposed test layer** (scenario / unit / both — default scenario unless one of the unit-test justifications in Step 6 applies), and whether it needs `skip_assert_against_bash: true`. An empty "add" list is a valid outcome — proceed to Step 7.

### Step 6: Write new tests (scenario preferred, unit when needed)

Only write tests for P1/P2 gaps marked "add". Adding zero tests is valid. Before writing each one, re-grep `tests/scenarios/cmd/<target>/`, `tests/scenarios/shell/<target>/`, and `interp/builtins/` to confirm it isn't a duplicate.

#### Layer selection: scenario by default, unit only when justified

**Scenario tests are the default.** A new test should be a YAML scenario unless the gap genuinely cannot be expressed there. This matches the project rule "Prefer scenario tests (`tests/scenarios/`) over Go tests" in `AGENTS.md`.

Write a **Go unit test** instead of (or in addition to) a scenario test only when at least one of these applies — and document which one in the per-target report:

| Justified reason for a unit test | Example |
|----------------------------------|---------|
| **Behavior is not observable through the shell surface** | An internal helper or method on `builtins.Command` whose result never reaches stdout/stderr/exit-code |
| **Specific Go-typed error or wrapping must be asserted** | `errors.Is(err, fs.ErrNotExist)`, custom error types from `interp/builtins/internal/...` |
| **Concurrency / goroutine context propagation** | Verifying `ctx.Err()` is checked between chunks in a goroutine, race-detector-only tests |
| **Sandbox/internal API contract** | Direct test of `callCtx.OpenFile` plumbing, `os.Root` interaction, `AllowedPaths` resolution that isn't user-visible |
| **Build-tag-gated platform behavior that scenarios can't express** | `//go:build windows` reserved-filename rejection, `//go:build linux` `/proc/net/*` parsing |
| **Bash divergence is intentional and the assertion would noise up scenarios** | An invariant of our parser/evaluator that has no bash equivalent and would force `skip_assert_against_bash: true` for trivial reasons |
| **Performance / resource-bound assertion** | Verifying memory cap or output limit at the API level rather than via 1MB script output |

If none of these apply: **write a scenario test, not a Go test.** "It's easier to write in Go" or "the scenario YAML feels verbose" are not valid reasons.

If both layers are warranted (e.g. user-visible behavior plus an internal invariant), write the scenario as the primary test and the Go test as a focused supplement — do not duplicate the same surface across both.

#### Scenario test (default path)

Create a YAML scenario test file. Follow the project conventions.

##### File organization

```
tests/scenarios/cmd/<command>/<category>/<test_name>.yaml
tests/scenarios/shell/<feature>/<category>/<test_name>.yaml
```

##### YAML format

```yaml
description: One sentence describing what this scenario tests.
setup:
  files:
    - path: relative/path/in/tempdir
      content: "file content here"
      chmod: 0644           # optional
      symlink: target/path  # optional
input:
  allowed_paths: ["$DIR"]   # "$DIR" resolves to the temp dir
  script: |+
    command arguments
expect:
  stdout: "expected output\n"
  stderr: ""
  exit_code: 0
```

##### Rules

- **No source attribution**: Do NOT include comments referencing external test suites in YAML test files
- **`stdout_contains` and `stderr_contains` must be YAML lists**, not scalar strings
- **Prefer `expect.stderr`** (exact match) over `stderr_contains` unless the error message is platform-specific
- **Prefer `expect.stdout`** (exact match) over `stdout_contains` whenever possible
- Tests are asserted against bash by default — only set `skip_assert_against_bash: true` for features that intentionally diverge from bash. When using this flag, **always add a YAML comment explaining why** (e.g. `# skip: sandbox blocks write operations`, `# skip: intentionally restricts redirections`)
- Use `stdout_windows`/`stderr_windows` for platform-specific output differences
- Use `|+` for multi-line content to preserve trailing newlines
- Do **not** use `echo -n` — the echo builtin does not support `-n` and will emit `-n ` literally. Use `printf` instead for newline-free output
- When testing error messages from our builtins, the error format is typically `<command>: <message>` — verify by running the command in the shell first

##### Determining expected output

For each new test, determine the correct expected output:

**Method A — Run in our shell first:**
```bash
go run . -c '<script>'
```

**Method B — Run in bash (Docker):**
```bash
docker run --rm debian:bookworm-slim bash -c '<script>'
```

**Method C — Run locally with bash:**
```bash
bash -c '<script>'
```

Always verify that our shell output matches bash for tests without `skip_assert_against_bash: true`.

#### Go unit test (fallback path)

Only when the gap matches one of the justified-reason rows above.

##### File organization

Add the test next to the existing tests for the target. Common locations:

```
interp/builtins/<target>_test.go
interp/builtins/tests/<target>/<focus>_test.go
interp/builtin_<target>_test.go
```

Pick the location that already holds tests for the same target — do not introduce a new file unless none exists.

##### Conventions

Match the style of nearby tests in the chosen file. Key rules: prefer table-driven tests for flag/edge matrices; use build tags for platform-specific files; never bypass `callCtx.OpenFile` with direct `os.Open`/`os.Stat` in setup; standard-library assertions only (`if got != want { t.Errorf(...) }`). Run `make fmt` and `go vet ./...` after each batch.

#### Batch size

Write tests in batches of 10-15 files (counting scenario YAMLs and Go test files together), then run verification (Step 10) before writing more. This catches format errors early.

### Step 7: Prune duplicate and low-value tests (unit + scenario)

Scan **both** Go unit tests and YAML scenario tests for the target — including newly written ones — and remove tests that don't earn their keep. Two categories qualify for removal:

1. **Duplicates** — tests that exercise the same behavior as another test
2. **Low-value tests** — tests whose failure would not signal a real regression

This step covers both test layers:

```bash
# Scenario tests (YAML)
find tests/scenarios/cmd/<target>/ -name "*.yaml" 2>/dev/null | sort
find tests/scenarios/shell/<target>/ -name "*.yaml" 2>/dev/null | sort

# Go unit tests
find interp/builtins/ -path "*<target>*_test.go" 2>/dev/null | sort
find interp/ -name "builtin_<target>*_test.go" 2>/dev/null | sort
find interp/builtins/tests/<target>/ -name "*_test.go" 2>/dev/null | sort
```

For Go unit tests, examine each `func Test...` and each row in any table-driven test slices (the inner test cases, not just the parent function).

#### Detecting duplicates

| Type | What it looks like |
|------|--------------------|
| **Exact duplicates** | Two YAML files with identical `input.script` and `expect`, or two Go test cases with identical inputs/assertions |
| **Near duplicates** | Functionally equivalent scripts/inputs that exercise the same code path — only cosmetic differences (variable names, file content that doesn't change behavior, equivalent flag spellings) |
| **Subset duplicates** | A test whose every assertion is already covered by a more comprehensive test |
| **Cross-layer duplicates** | A scenario test that exercises exactly the same surface as a Go unit test (or vice versa). Prefer the scenario test if it asserts user-visible behavior that bash would also validate; prefer the Go test if it asserts an internal API that scenarios can't reach |

#### Detecting low-value tests

A test is low-value if a regression that breaks it would not break a real script. Concrete signals:

| Signal | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Tests an implementation detail, not behavior** | Asserts on internal struct field, or that a private helper was called |
| **Asserts on something that cannot vary** | Hardcoded constants, version strings checked against themselves, tautologies (`assert x == x`) |
| **Permissive assertions that catch nothing** | `stdout_contains: ""`, `stderr_contains: ""`, only checks `exit_code: 0` with no output assertion when output is the actual contract |
| **P3/P4 gap that snuck in** | Speculative edge case with no real-world script that would hit it (re-apply the Step 5 high-value filter) |
| **Trivial smoke for a flag already covered by richer tests** | A standalone `cmd --help` test when a richer test already exercises help output and exit code |
| **Tests blocked behavior the sandbox already rejects elsewhere** | If `interp/` rejects the syntax at parse time and other tests already cover that rejection, don't repeat it per-builtin |

A test is **not** low-value just because it is short or simple — short tests of load-bearing behavior are good. The question is always: *if this test started failing tomorrow, would that signal a real bug?* If no, prune it.

#### Process

For each candidate (duplicate or low-value):

1. **Identify the candidate** and write one sentence stating why it's a duplicate or low-value.
2. **Pick a winner if it's a duplicate**: prefer the test with clearer description, stricter assertions (`expect.stdout` over `stdout_contains`), better file organization, or the layer (scenario vs unit) that better matches the behavior.
3. **For Go test removals**: delete the table row or the whole `func Test...` cleanly — don't leave dangling helpers, fixtures, or imports. Run `go vet ./...` after each batch.
4. **For YAML removals**: `git rm` the file.
5. **Document the decision**: log to the per-target report (Step 11) so reviewers can see what was pruned and why.

Be conservative on low-value pruning. When in doubt, keep the test — false-positive removal of a test you don't fully understand is worse than keeping a marginal test. If a test looks low-value but you can't articulate the regression-signal sentence in either direction, leave it alone.

Tally the removals separately for the per-target report:
- Duplicates removed (scenario count, unit count)
- Low-value tests removed (scenario count, unit count)

If nothing qualifies for removal, note that and move on.

### Step 8: Review skip_assert_against_bash flags

Scan all scenario tests for the target that have `skip_assert_against_bash: true` and evaluate whether the flag is still needed by **diffing our shell against bash side-by-side**.

```bash
grep -rl "skip_assert_against_bash: true" tests/scenarios/cmd/<target>/ tests/scenarios/shell/<target>/ 2>/dev/null
```

For each flagged test, run the script in **both** shells and compare stdout, stderr, and exit code. **Mirror the scenario YAML's sandbox config on the CLI** so the diff reflects the engine's behaviour, not artificial CLI-default rejections:

| Scenario YAML field | CLI flag to mirror it | Notes |
|---------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| no `allowed_commands` (the common case) | `--allow-all-commands` | Without this, the CLI defaults to `rshell:`-namespaced builtins only and almost every script fails with "command not allowed", masking the real divergence |
| `allowed_commands: [...]` (restricted set) | `--allowed-commands <comma,list>` | Do **not** combine with `--allow-all-commands` |
| `allowed_paths: [...]` | `--allowed-paths <tempdir>` | Substitute `$DIR` with a real tempdir |
| `setup.files` | (create them in the tempdir first) | |

**Exception:** scenarios under `tests/scenarios/shell/blocked_commands/` exist precisely to assert blocking. Do **not** add `--allow-all-commands` for those — the rejection *is* the test, and the diff should show "bash runs / our shell rejects" as the expected divergence.

```bash
# Pick CLI flags based on the YAML — example for an unrestricted scenario:
TMP=$(mktemp -d)
# (create any setup.files under $TMP)

# Our shell (mirrors YAML config; --allow-all-commands when YAML has no allowed_commands)
go run ./cmd/rshell --allow-all-commands --allowed-paths "$TMP" -c '<script>' \
  >/tmp/rsh.out 2>/tmp/rsh.err; echo $? > /tmp/rsh.exit

# Bash (local or Docker)
bash -c '<script>' >/tmp/bash.out 2>/tmp/bash.err; echo $? > /tmp/bash.exit
# or: docker run --rm -v "$TMP:$TMP" -w "$TMP" debian:bookworm-slim bash -c '<script>' …

# Diff
diff /tmp/rsh.out /tmp/bash.out
diff /tmp/rsh.err /tmp/bash.err
diff /tmp/rsh.exit /tmp/bash.exit
```

Read the test's existing `# skip: …` YAML comment (if any) — that comment names the divergence the original author intended the flag to cover. Then classify based on the diff:

| Diff result vs. existing `# skip:` comment | Action |
|--------------------------------------------|--------|
| **No diff** (stdout, stderr, exit code all match) | Flag is stale → remove `skip_assert_against_bash: true` |
| **Diff exists and matches the existing `# skip:` comment** | Keep flag; no action needed |
| **Diff exists but the `# skip:` comment is missing or describes a different divergence** | Update the comment to accurately describe the current divergence; if no comment exists, add one |
| **Diff is purely a sandbox / blocked-command / readonly rejection** (e.g. our shell prints `command not allowed: <cmd>` while bash runs it) | Keep flag; normalise the YAML comment wording (e.g. `# skip: sandbox blocks <cmd>`) |
| **Diff is a real shell bug** (our shell produces wrong output for behaviour that should match bash) | Keep flag for now, **add an entry to the per-target report's "Findings" section** describing the bug and the diff; do not silently leave it |
| **Test scenario is wrong** (neither matches bash nor tests intentional divergence) | Fix the test expectations |

For each test where the flag is removed, verify it now passes against bash:

```bash
RSHELL_BASH_TEST=1 go test ./tests/ -run "TestShellScenariosAgainstBash/<scenario_name>" -timeout 120s -v
```

**Reporting:** every divergence surfaced by the diff — even ones that keep the flag — flows into Step 11's "Findings" section with the specific stdout/stderr/exit diff. This is the main channel by which `/improve-test-coverage` discovers shell bugs that the test suite has been silently masking.

### Step 9: Review unnecessary Windows-specific assertions

Scan all scenario tests for the target that use Windows-specific assertion fields and evaluate whether they are actually needed.

```bash
grep -rl "stdout_windows\|stderr_windows\|stdout_contains_windows\|stderr_contains_windows" tests/scenarios/cmd/<target>/ 2>/dev/null
grep -rl "stdout_windows\|stderr_windows\|stdout_contains_windows\|stderr_contains_windows" tests/scenarios/shell/<target>/ 2>/dev/null
```

For each test with Windows-specific assertions:

1. **Read the test** and compare the Windows-specific field value against the non-Windows field value
2. **Evaluate whether the difference is genuine**: Windows-specific assertions are only needed when output genuinely differs on Windows — typically:
   - Path separators (`\` vs `/`)
   - Line endings (`\r\n` vs `\n`)
   - OS-specific error messages
   - Windows reserved filenames (CON, PRN, NUL, etc.)
3. **Classify the result**:

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Windows value is identical to non-Windows value | Remove the Windows-specific field (redundant) |
| Windows value differs only due to path separators or line endings | Keep — this is a valid platform difference |
| Windows value differs for unclear reasons | Investigate further; if no genuine platform difference exists, remove |
| Windows field exists but non-Windows field is missing | Check if both should have the same value and consolidate |

For each unnecessary Windows-specific assertion removed, the non-Windows assertion serves as the fallback and will be used on all platforms.

### Step 10: Fix failing tests

Run the `/fix-ci-tests` skill to verify all tests pass and fix any failures. This will:
- Run scenario tests and Go tests
- Run bash comparison tests
- Fix test expectations or shell implementation as needed
- Re-run until all tests pass

If `skip_assert_against_bash: true` is added to any test, ensure a YAML comment explains why.

### Step 11: Commit, push, update COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md, post per-target report

After all tests pass for the current target, update the progress tracker, commit everything together, push, and post a per-target report.

#### 1. Update COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md

Edit the row for the current target:
- Set `Tests (after)` to the new count
- Set `Status` to ✅ if work was done, or ⏭️ if no high-value gaps existed (no tests were added/changed)
- Add a one-line note in the `Notes` column summarizing the outcome (e.g. "added 4 P1 tests, removed 1 duplicate" or "no high-value gaps — Go tests cover the surface")

Update the `## Summary` block at the bottom:
- Increment `Targets processed`
- Add this target's deltas to the totals — tests added split as `(scenario: n, unit: n)`, duplicates and low-value removals split the same way, plus skip-flag and Windows-assertion removals

#### 2. Commit and push

The commit must include the test scenario changes **and** the COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md update in a single commit. **One commit per target** — do not bundle multiple targets into one commit.

```bash
# Stage scenario test changes, any unit-test changes from Step 7 pruning,
# and the progress tracker
git add tests/scenarios/ interp/ COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md

# (If the target had no test changes, still commit the progress update alone.)
git commit -m "test: improve coverage for <target>

Add scenario tests to improve coverage. See PR comment for full report.
Update COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md with this target's results.

git push
```

If the push fails (e.g. no upstream branch), set the upstream:

```bash
git push -u origin "$(git branch --show-current)"
```

#### 3. Determine the PR number

```bash
gh pr view --json number --jq '.number'
```

If no PR exists for the current branch, skip posting and print the report to the console instead.

#### 4. Build and post the per-target report

Compose the report and post it as a PR comment:

```markdown
## Coverage Improvement Summary — `<target>`

**Target**: <command or feature>
**Reference suites consulted**: <list>

### New tests added
| File | Layer | Priority | Why a regression here would matter |
|------|-------|----------|------------------------------------|
| ... | scenario / unit | P1/P2 | ... |

For each unit-test row, also note the Step 6 unit-test justification (e.g. "concurrency", "typed error", "build-tag platform"). If nothing was added, say so and why existing coverage was sufficient.

### Candidates skipped
| Candidate gap | Reason |
|--------------|--------|
| ... | duplicate / cosmetic variant / unreachable / etc. |

### Coverage before/after
- Scenario tests: N → M (+X new)
- Unit tests / cases: P → Q (+Y new)
- Evaluated: Z; added: X+Y; skipped: Z-(X+Y)

### Cleanup
- Duplicate tests removed: <count> (scenario: <n>, unit: <n>)
- Low-value tests removed: <count> (scenario: <n>, unit: <n>)
- `skip_assert_against_bash` flags removed: <count>
- Unnecessary Windows-specific assertions removed: <count>

For each removal, list the file/test name and a one-sentence reason (duplicate of X / low-value because Y).

### Findings
- <any shell bugs discovered>
- <any intentional divergences noted>

```bash
gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
<report content here>
EOF
)"
```

If posting fails (e.g. permissions), print the report to the console as a fallback.

#### 5. Proceed to next target

After posting, move to the next target in the list and start its Step 4. Continue until all targets are processed, then move to Phase C.

---

## Phase C — Finalization

Phase C runs once, after every target in the list has reached Step 11. It clears any CI failures introduced during the run, posts the consolidated report, and removes the progress tracker from the branch.

### Step 12: Run /fix-ci-tests to clear CI failures

Per-target Step 10 only runs the local test suite. Remote CI may still fail (lint, vet, formatting, bash-comparison jobs that local Docker skipped, platform-specific runners, etc.). Before posting the final report, invoke the `/fix-ci-tests` skill to diagnose and fix any failing CI checks on this branch's PR.

```bash
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number --jq '.number')
```

If a PR exists, invoke the skill (it reads failing checks from `gh`, fixes them, and re-pushes until green):

- Use the Skill tool with `skill: fix-ci-tests` and pass the PR number as the argument.
- Let it run to completion. It may push additional commits to the branch — that is expected.

If no PR exists for the current branch, skip this step (there is no remote CI to fix) and proceed to Step 13.

After `/fix-ci-tests` returns, confirm the branch is green:

```bash
gh pr checks "$PR_NUMBER"
```

If checks are still failing for reasons outside the skill's scope (e.g. the `verified/allowed_symbols` label, which is reserved for human approval — see `AGENTS.md`), note them in the Step 13 final report's "Findings" section and proceed. Do **not** attempt to bypass labels reserved for human review.

### Step 13: Post final coverage report to PR

Read the now-fully-populated `COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md` and post a single PR comment that embeds it as the final summary.

```bash
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number --jq '.number')
```

If no PR exists for the current branch, skip posting and print the report to the console instead. (You can reuse the `PR_NUMBER` looked up in Step 12.)

The comment body has this structure (the entire `COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md` content is included verbatim inside the fenced section):

```markdown
## Final Coverage Improvement Report

This run of `/improve-test-coverage` is complete. Per-target detail comments are posted above; the table below is the consolidated tracker that drove this run.

```

If posting fails, print the report to the console.

### Step 14: Remove COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md from the PR

`COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md` is a working document for the run, not part of the merged change set. Remove it in a final commit on the same branch.

```bash
git rm COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md
git commit -m "chore: remove COVERAGE_PROGRESS.md after coverage run

Final coverage report has been posted as a PR comment. The tracker file
is no longer needed on the branch.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
git push
```

After this commit lands, the PR no longer carries the tracker file but the final report comment preserves the full progress history.
