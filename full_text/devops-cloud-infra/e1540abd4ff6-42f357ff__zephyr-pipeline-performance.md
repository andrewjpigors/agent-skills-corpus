description: Write a Zephyr/Iris data-generation pipeline that finishes in minutes (not hours) and ships a clean corpus (not a silently-corrupted one). Use when authoring or reviewing an `exp<N>_data_*/cli.py` (or any `map_shard`-based job that fetches per-row inputs and emits parquet). Covers the per-row / per-shard / per-worker / per-job decisions for wall-clock plus the fail-loud default for data quality — including **neural / accelerator (TPU) tokenizers** when the model is the cost (batched bucketed inference, `ResourceConfig.with_tpu`, and parallel scans for sequential-recurrence models like SSMs/RNNs).

# Skill: write performant Zephyr pipelines

A Zephyr pipeline that *works* and one that *finishes in budget* differ on a
small set of decisions you make once at the top of `cli.py`. Most of them
are unobvious from the marin-zephyr docs because the costs aren't local.
They show up as straggler tails, silently-truncated reads, or cluster bills,
not as wrong output.

**Before any of them, make one upstream choice: which regime is your pipeline
in?** For almost every pipeline the per-row cost is a **GCS fetch** and the CPU
step is cheap — it is **I/O-bound**, and the TL;DR below (and every section
after it) is written for that case. The exception is when the per-row work is a
**neural forward pass on an accelerator** (a tokenizer model on TPU/GPU): there
the compute can dominate the fetch, and the decisions change — you batch onto
the accelerator instead of threading per row. Profile one row to tell which you
are (see [Project before optimizing](#1-project-before-optimizing)); if compute
wins, skip to [Neural / accelerator
tokenizers](#neural--accelerator-tokenizers-when-the-model-is-the-cost). Unless
a section says otherwise, everything that follows assumes I/O-bound.

This skill draws on lessons from real MarinFold pipelines — two
I/O-bound, one compute-bound:

* `experiments/exp5_data_contacts_and_distances_v2_zephyr/` (1.6 M
  structures). The README's success criterion documents a prior
  `gcs_uri`-mode production run (without intra-shard concurrency) at
  **≤ 8 min wall-clock**. The current shape adds intra-shard threading
  on top, so wall-clock should be no worse than that bound. **exp5
  is currently on a PR branch, not yet on `main`**. If you need to
  read its code, locate the PR via `gh pr list` and check it out
  locally (or browse on github.com).
* [`experiments/exp53_data_contacts_v1_zephyr/`](../../../experiments/exp53_data_contacts_v1_zephyr/)
  (4.2 M structures, pyconfind-heavy). Two hard-won fixes mid-development
  prevented this one from running for many cluster-hours: the
  rotamer-library memoization
  ([`daa18e1`](https://github.com/Open-Athena/MarinFold/commit/daa18e1))
  and the gzip-truncation fix
  ([`43a0535`](https://github.com/Open-Athena/MarinFold/commit/43a0535)).
  Without them, a smoke test produced only 2/100 valid documents.
  Both lessons are documented as patterns below.
* [`experiments/exp40_document_structures_generate_bio2token_documents_on_zephyr/`](../../../experiments/exp40_document_structures_generate_bio2token_documents_on_zephyr/)
  (bio2token, a Mamba neural tokenizer on TPU) — the **compute-bound**
  case: the per-row cost is a model forward pass, not a fetch, which
  inverts the concurrency model (batch onto the accelerator instead of
  threading per row) and adds XLA concerns (static-shape bucketing, a
  parallel scan). The worked example for the [neural
  section](#neural--accelerator-tokenizers-when-the-model-is-the-cost) below.

When you're done, your pipeline should clear every box in the
[Pre-launch checklist](#pre-launch-checklist) at the end of this skill.

---

## TL;DR: the six decisions that dominate (I/O-bound pipelines)

1. **Inside `map_shard`, run a `ThreadPoolExecutor` around the per-row
   fetch+parse.** GCS GETs are ~30–80 ms; gemmi parse releases the GIL.
   Threading them is the largest per-shard speedup available. exp5's
   prior sequential version landed at ~128 s/shard; threaded should
   drop well below that (estimated low-single-digit seconds at
   fetch-concurrency 32 over ~2,000 rows, though actual cluster
   wall-clock is not yet re-measured).
2. **`--worker-cpu 1`, scale via `--max-workers`.** Per-shard CPU is
   single-threaded Python once the in-shard thread pool overlaps the I/O.
   Asking for more cores per worker wastes cluster capacity.
3. **Pin `--region` and use `--preemptible`.** Without region pinning, an
   over-requested on-demand pool spills cross-continent (exp53 spilled to
   `europe-west4` and got a multi-hour straggler tail). With preemptible
   workers you get more in-region capacity at lower cost; Zephyr retries
   preemptions.
4. **Fetch per-row objects via
   `marinfold.document_structures.io.read_object_bytes`** (a full
   `cat_file` GET), not `fsspec.open().read()`. GCS objects with
   `Content-Encoding: gzip` report compressed size in `Content-Length`,
   so a size-based read truncates large objects mid-content. The bug
   is silent: your parser fails downstream with a confusing
   "unexpected end" error, not an obvious I/O fault.
5. **Source per-row data via the manifest's `gcs_uri` pointer column,
   not the inline `cif_content` column.** Datasets like afdb-1.6M ship
   every cif twice: a one-line `gcs_uri` pointer to AFDB's public GCS
   bucket, *and* the full inline mmCIF text as `cif_content`. Reading
   `gcs_uri` means a small fan-out of in-cloud (often in-region) GCS
   GETs; reading `cif_content` means every worker streams the bulk
   mmCIF back from HuggingFace cross-cloud per shard. Same downstream
   output, ~2,000× less manifest I/O plus a fundamentally cheaper
   per-row fetch. Default to `--cif-uri-column=gcs_uri`; reserve
   `--cif-text-column` for local testing or inputs without a URI column.
6. **Default to fail-loud on data-quality failures.** When a fetch,
   parse, or generate raises, let the Zephyr worker die with a real
   stack trace. A killed worker forces you to triage the bug now,
   when the cluster job is small; a silently-dropped row corrupts the
   training corpus and surfaces weeks later as a model that behaves
   slightly oddly, recovery path "re-run the entire pipeline." The
   library helpers default to raise; opt into lenient mode
   (`read_object_bytes(uri, missing_ok=True)`) only per call site,
   with a comment tying the choice to a specific policy. Return
   `None` only for *designed-in filter predicates* (the structure is
   multi-chain, too small to fit, etc.), not for swallowed exceptions.
   See the "Fail loud on data-quality failures" section below.

The rest of this skill walks through each layer of the pipeline
(per-row, per-shard, per-job, per-output) with the code patterns
these decisions imply. (Compute-bound neural tokenizers take a
different path — see the regime note above.)

---

## Fail loud on data-quality failures

The principle from TL;DR #6, in code. The library helpers default
to raise; lenient mode is opt-in per call site, with a comment:

```python
# Pipeline policy is "drop, don't backfill" per issue #N; missing
# AFDB cifs are expected for ~0.1% of cluster ids that were
# retracted upstream.
cif = read_object_bytes(uri, missing_ok=True)
if cif is None:
    return None
```

The two cases where returning ``None`` is correct (not a
swallowed failure):

1. **Designed-in filter predicates.** The worker has explicitly
   determined the row is not eligible for output: a multi-chain
   structure when single-chain is required, a sequence too short
   to fit the context budget, etc. These look like
   ``if structure.num_chains > 1: return None``, not exception
   handlers around upstream calls. The smoke run audits these by
   inspecting *which* rows returned ``None`` and confirming each
   one matches the predicate.
2. **Explicitly opted-in lenient mode** (as above), with a comment
   tying the decision to a specific failure mode and a policy
   document.

Everything else should raise. If your smoke run drops rows you
can't immediately explain via one of these two cases, the right
move is to delay scaling and figure out why, even if it's only one
row in a hundred.

---

## Per-shard: thread the I/O, memoize the heavy init

A Zephyr `map_shard` body runs once per input shard. Two things matter:

### 1. ThreadPoolExecutor inside `map_shard` for per-row fetches

Without it, your per-shard wall-clock is the **sum** of per-row GCS GETs
(sequential I/O). With it, fetches overlap each other *and* overlap the
CPU work of rows already fetched. gemmi (and pyconfind) release the GIL
during the C++ parse, so the threads make real progress in parallel.

The pattern is captured as
[`marinfold.document_structures.io.thread_per_row_in_shard`](../../../marinfold/marinfold/document_structures/io.py)
so each new pipeline gets the correctness details (pool size cap,
`pool.map` for input-order output, `None`-skip for failed rows) by
construction rather than re-deriving them:

```python
from functools import partial
from marinfold.document_structures.io import thread_per_row_in_shard

def generate_shard(items, shard_info, *, cfg, fetch_concurrency=32, ...):
    worker = partial(_generate_doc_for_row, cfg=cfg, ...)
    yield from thread_per_row_in_shard(
        items, worker=worker,
        fetch_concurrency=fetch_concurrency,
        thread_name_prefix="exp<N>-fetch",
    )
```

**Default `--fetch-concurrency=32`** is well-calibrated for the common
case where the per-row GCS GET (~30–80 ms) is an order of magnitude
larger than the per-row CPU step. If your CPU step is heavier (e.g.
pyconfind-based contact computation in exp53, where per-doc CPU
dominates), threading still helps but its marginal effect shrinks.
The right concurrency knob is then closer to the worker's effective
core count than to the I/O latency ratio.

If you have *no* per-row I/O (inline cif text in the manifest), skip
the helper. There's nothing to overlap and a thread pool is pure
overhead. exp53's `generate_shard` shows the branch:

```python
if cif_text_column is not None:
    # Inline path: no I/O to overlap, run sequentially.
    for row in items:
        out = worker(row)
        if out is not None:
            yield out
    return
# URI path: thread the fetches via the shared helper.
yield from thread_per_row_in_shard(items, worker=worker, ...)
```

### 2. Memoize per-worker init in a module global

A Zephyr worker process serves many shards over its lifetime. If your
algorithm requires a heavy per-process resource (parsed reference
library, loaded model, JIT-compiled kernel), **do not initialize it
per shard or per row**. Cache it in a module-level global so it's
parsed once per worker.

exp53's
[commit `daa18e1`](https://github.com/Open-Athena/MarinFold/commit/daa18e1)
is the canonical example: pyconfind's rotamer library takes tens of
seconds to parse. Before the fix, every shard paid that cost. After
(using ``functools.cache`` for the cross-shard memoization):

```python
import functools

@functools.cache
def _load_rotamer_library():
    try:
        from pyconfind import load_library, cached_rotamer_library
        return load_library(cached_rotamer_library())
    except Exception as exc:
        warnings.warn(f"preload failed ({exc}); per-call load", stacklevel=2)
        return None
```

The stdlib ``functools.cache`` covers the load-bearing part for free:
it distinguishes "not yet called" from "called and returned None", so
a worker whose preload genuinely returned ``None`` once doesn't retry
per shard. Cache plus ``try/except`` together give you lazy init,
cached failure, no per-shard retry, and no hand-rolled sentinel.

This pattern compounds. A 30 s per-worker init across 500 workers
times 100 shards-per-worker is a **41-hour cluster bill** if you do
it per shard; 30 s times 500 once-per-worker is a 15-second blip.

---

## Per-job: cluster resources

The `ZephyrContext` / Iris `job run` call is where you decide how the
cluster spends its time. Two rules dominate.

### 1. `--worker-cpu 1`, scale via `--max-workers`

Per-shard CPU is single-threaded Python once the in-shard thread pool
overlaps the I/O. A worker with 4 CPUs just leaves 3 idle. Use the smallest
worker that fits one Python process + your peak memory, then scale out:

```bash
uv run iris --cluster=marin job run --cpu 1 --memory 2GB -- \
    python cli.py generate \
        --worker-cpu 1 --worker-memory 4g --worker-disk 32g \
        --max-workers 512 --fetch-concurrency 32 \
        ...
```

Note the *two* cpu/memory pairs: the **outer** `--cpu`/`--memory` on
`iris job run` sizes the **launcher container** (tiny); the **inner**
`--worker-cpu`/`--worker-memory` (consumed by `ZephyrContext`) sizes
each **worker pod**. Overspending on the launcher is wasteful but
harmless; overspending on the workers multiplies by 500+, which is
not harmless at all.

### 2. Pin `--region`, request `--preemptible`

The shared marin Iris cluster straddles regions and continents (see the
project root [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) "Cross-region data transfers
& the shared Iris cluster"). Without pinning, large worker pools spill to
fallback regions and your job's tail latency becomes "the slowest worker
in `europe-west4` dragged across the Atlantic":

```python
ctx = ZephyrContext(
    max_workers=args.max_workers,
    resources=ResourceConfig(
        cpu=args.worker_cpu,
        ram=args.worker_memory,
        disk=args.worker_disk,
        regions=[args.region] if args.region else None,   # pin
        preemptible=args.preemptible,                      # cheaper + more capacity
    ),
)
```

```python
# argparse:
p.add_argument("--region", type=str, default="us-central1",
               help="Pin workers to this GCP region (match the iris cluster) "
                    "so a large pool can't spill cross-region/continent.")
p.add_argument("--preemptible", action=argparse.BooleanOptionalAction,
               default=True,
               help="Request preemptible/spot workers. More in-region "
                    "capacity than on-demand at lower cost; zephyr "
                    "retries preemptions.")
```

exp53's
[commit `7c19d5d`](https://github.com/Open-Athena/MarinFold/commit/7c19d5d)
added these knobs after the first full run got a multi-hour straggler tail
from cross-continent on-demand spills.

### 3. Match output bucket to the cluster's region

The output bucket `gs://marin-<region>/protein-structure/MarinFold/<exp>/`
**must** be in the same region as the workers, or every per-row PUT
is a cross-region transfer (cost and latency). For the Iris cluster's
`us-central1` default, that's `gs://marin-us-central1/...`. See the
root [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) "GCS bucket" section.

---

## Per-input: source via `gcs_uri`, project columns aggressively

Two levers, in order of impact.

### 1. Pick the right data-source column

afdb-1.6M (and other AFDB-derived manifests on HuggingFace) ship every
cif *twice*: as a one-line `gcs_uri` pointer to the public AFDB GCS
bucket, **and** as the full inline mmCIF text in a `cif_content` column.

The choice between them dominates everything else in this section.

With `gcs_uri`, workers fetch from AFDB's GCS bucket directly. For a
GCP-based cluster (the marin Iris pool), that's in-cloud and usually
in-region: fast network, no cross-cloud egress charges. Reading the
manifest costs ~160 KB/shard (just the URI strings plus provenance).

With `cif_content`, every worker reads the bulky inline mmCIF back
from HuggingFace, cross-cloud, per row. Reading the manifest costs
~70 MB/shard (~2,000× more I/O), and that bulk crosses the open
internet rather than staying inside GCP.

Default to `--cif-uri-column=gcs_uri`. Reserve `--cif-text-column` for
local tests (where inline cif keeps the path off the network entirely)
or for input manifests that don't ship a URI column.

A related trap: if you have to enumerate the HF manifest's *shards*
up front, do it through an authenticated `HfFileSystem` with a
pre-warmed dircache plus the `/resolve/` CDN URLs (one API call to
list, N CDN reads for the data). Per-shard `hf://` reads make one
`paths-info` API call each, which blows HF's 3,000 req / 5 min quota
on a multi-thousand-shard manifest. See the "HuggingFace API quota"
trap below.

### 2. Read only the columns you need

Parquet is columnar.
`Dataset.from_files(input).load_parquet(columns=…)` reads only the
requested columns. With `gcs_uri` picked, the minimal set is
`[entry_id, gcs_uri, <optional passthrough>]`, about 160 KB/shard.
Reading the full row (including `cif_content`) is ~70 MB/shard
regardless of which fetch path you take downstream, so column
projection is what *activates* the data-source win.

The exp5 pattern: peek the manifest schema once at submission time,
decide which optional passthrough columns are present, then pass the
closed-over list to every shard's load:

```python
_OPTIONAL_PASSTHROUGH = ("split", "seq_cluster_id", "struct_cluster_id",
                         "uniprot_accession", "tax_id", "organism_name", "gcs_uri")

def _resolve_input_columns(input_path, cif_col):
    """Peek the first parquet file, intersect with desired columns."""
    import pyarrow.parquet as pq
    fs, _ = fsspec.core.url_to_fs(input_path)
    matches = sorted(fs.glob(input_path))
    with fsspec.open(fs.unstrip_protocol(matches[0]), "rb") as f:
        present = set(pq.ParquetFile(f).schema_arrow.names)
    # Validate required + collect optional passthrough.
    if "entry_id" not in present or cif_col not in present:
        raise ValueError(...)
    passthrough = [c for c in _OPTIONAL_PASSTHROUGH if c in present]
    columns = ["entry_id", cif_col] + [c for c in passthrough if c not in ("entry_id", cif_col)]
    return columns, passthrough
```

The schema peek happens once on the controller, not 1,000 × on workers.
The same column list is used for every shard so the output schema is
stable across shards (downstream readers can concatenate without
schema-merging).

---

## Per-output: one parquet per input shard

Use a `{shard}` placeholder in `--out` so Zephyr writes one output file
per input shard:

```bash
--out "gs://marin-us-central1/.../corpus-{shard:05d}-of-{total:05d}.parquet"
```

This is load-bearing for two reasons. First, write throughput: many
small writers in parallel beat one centralized writer's serialized
output stream. Second, provenance and restartability: if shard 042
fails, you re-run with a filter on input shard 042 and the rest of
the output stays intact. See
`experiments/exp53_data_contacts_v1_zephyr/rerun_missing.py` for the
resume pattern.

For smoke tests, omit `{shard}` (or pass `--num-docs N`) to collapse
to a single output file:

```python
if "{shard" not in args.out:
    out_rows = out_rows.reshard(1)
```

The output ordering policy is up to you; exp5 + exp53 both use
`executor.map` (preserves input order within a shard) for determinism.
exp53 additionally orders Stage A's input shards in descending pLDDT-round
order so the highest-quality data is read *last* by streaming consumers.

---

## I/O traps that silently destroy throughput

### AFDB GCS objects are gzip-transcoded; use the shared reader

`Content-Encoding: gzip` objects report their **compressed** size in the
content-length header. A size-based read (`fsspec.open(uri, "rb").read()`
or `compression="infer"` plus slicing) reads only that many bytes of
the decompressed stream and silently truncates large cifs
mid-`_atom_site`. gemmi then raises `"Wrong number of values in loop
_atom_site"`.

The fix is a single full GET (the filesystem's `cat_file`) that reads
to EOF. That's what
[`marinfold.document_structures.io.read_object_bytes`](../../../marinfold/marinfold/document_structures/io.py)
does. It raises on I/O failure by default (per the "Fail loud"
section above), so a corrupted fetch surfaces as a worker crash
with a real stack trace rather than as a silently-missing row in
the corpus:

```python
from marinfold.document_structures.io import (
    read_object_bytes, thread_per_row_in_shard,
)

def _generate_doc_for_row(row, *, cif_uri_column, ...):
    cif = read_object_bytes(row[cif_uri_column])  # gzip-safe; raises on failure
    # ... parse, generate, etc. Exceptions from any of these also propagate.
```

Symptom check: under the fail-loud default, a truncation bug surfaces
as a crash on the first affected row, not a silent drop. If you find
yourself reading "Wrong number of values in loop _atom_site" in a
worker traceback, this is almost certainly the bug, and the fix is to
ensure the per-row fetch goes through `read_object_bytes` (which
uses `cat_file`) rather than a size-based `fsspec.open().read()`.
If your pipeline runs in opt-in lenient mode and you instead see a
suspiciously high *rate* of skipped rows, the same diagnosis applies.

### Requester-pays buckets (AFDB)

The AFDB GCS bucket is requester-pays. Local user credentials get
truncated reads; Iris workers' service account reads fine. Means:
**the `gcs_uri` per-row fetch path is only validatable on-cluster**, not
on your laptop. Plan a small `--num-docs 100` smoke on Iris before the full
run (exp53 did this).

### HuggingFace API quota when listing many shards

afdb-24M has ~12,000 parquet shards. Per-shard `hf://` reads make one
`paths-info` API call each, blowing through HF's 3,000 req / 5 min quota
on a single dataset listing. The mitigation lives in exp53's
[`fetch_manifest_columns.py`](../../../experiments/exp53_data_contacts_v1_zephyr/fetch_manifest_columns.py):
use an authenticated `HfFileSystem` with a **pre-warmed dircache** + the
`/resolve/` CDN URLs for the actual reads. One API call to list, N CDN
reads for the data.

### `httpx<1` for marin-iris

The marin-iris GCP provider calls `httpx.Client(timeout=...)`, removed
in the 1.0 prerelease. Pin `httpx<1` in your `pyproject.toml` base
deps. exp53 discovered this in its HANDOFF; pin it preemptively.

---

## Stage the work: cheap selection, then heavy generation

Large data pipelines benefit from a **two-stage** layout.

Stage A (selection) is metadata-only. Read a few small columns from
the input manifest (entry_id, pLDDT, cluster ids, ...), compute the
selection, shuffling, or round assignment in Python or DuckDB, and
emit a *new* parquet manifest. This stage runs in seconds to minutes
on one process and is trivially re-runnable.

Stage B (generation) consumes Stage A's manifest and does the per-row
fetch plus heavy compute. This is the Zephyr/Iris stage with all the
lessons above.

exp53 split this way: `selection.py` reduces 24 M structures to 4.2 M
selected (entry, round) records in ~13 s, then `cli.py generate` runs
the heavy per-row work on the 4.2 M-row manifest.

The reason to split: selection logic changes more often than
generation logic (filter thresholds, split policies, round counts),
and the iteration cost should match. Don't recompute structure
parsing every time you want to test a new selection.

---

## Validation flow: smoke before full run

```
1. Local unit tests (no Zephyr): test_cli.py against file:// URIs.
2. Local Zephyr smoke (in-process): ZephyrContext with 2-3 inline rows.
3. Iris smoke: --num-docs 100, one input shard, single output file.
   Verify the smoke completed without crashing (fail-loud default
   means no swallowed errors), every dropped row matches a
   designed-in filter predicate, per-doc latency, output schema.
4. GATE: report measured rate + worker count + projected wall-clock to
   the user. Don't auto-trigger the full run.
5. Full run after explicit go-ahead.
```

Step 3 is the one that catches almost everything: the gzip truncation, the
requester-pays issue, the cross-region spill, the per-worker init bug.
Run it on every change; don't skip it because "the local tests passed."

Per-doc latency from the smoke is what you use to project full-run
wall-clock: `n_docs / (workers × docs_per_sec_per_worker)`. **Treat
this as a lower-bound estimate, not a guarantee.** Startup overhead,
preemption retries, straggler tails, and per-worker init costs all
land on top of the per-doc rate, and the gap can be 2–5×. The
projection's job is to flag "this is hours, not minutes" before you
spend the cluster time finding out, not to predict the wall-clock to
the minute.

---

## Finding the next perf opportunity

If your smoke run's projected wall-clock is out of budget (or if you
just want to know whether there's headroom), these are the steps that
surface the right thing to fix. The order matters: each step is cheap
and rules out a class of bottlenecks the next step would otherwise
misdiagnose.

### 1. Project before optimizing

Don't reach for cProfile yet. Compute the **per-row latency** from the
smoke and break it into the parts you can change vs the parts you can't:

```
per_row = network_GET  +  parse  +  generate  +  write
        ~30–80 ms      +  ms     +  ms        +  µs   (typical)
```

If the network GET dominates (it usually does for cif fetches), no
amount of Python-side optimization helps. `thread_per_row_in_shard`
is your win, and you're done. If parse or generate dominates, then
profiling is worthwhile. **Decide which regime you're in before
investing in tools.** Most of the time the answer is "I/O dominates,
thread it, ship."

### 2. cProfile a representative single-row run, sorted by `tottime`

Once you've decided the CPU side is worth investigating, profile one
row on a *real* input. Synthetic fixtures are pathological-fast and
hide the loops you want to find.

```python
import cProfile, pstats
prof = cProfile.Profile()
prof.enable()
for _ in range(200):                       # amortize fixed overhead
    generate_doc_for_row(real_row, ...)
prof.disable()
pstats.Stats(prof).strip_dirs().sort_stats("tottime").print_stats(15)
```

Read **`tottime`**, not `cumtime`. `tottime` is time spent *in* the
function excluding callees, which is what points at the hot loop.
`cumtime` is dominated by your top-level entry point and tells you
nothing actionable. Run the loop ≥ 200 times so the per-call overhead
of the profiler itself doesn't dominate cheap calls.

### 3. Isolate the components

End-to-end timing tells you the total; **component timing tells you
where the total comes from**. Time each layer independently against the
same input:

```python
# Component A: parse only
t = time.perf_counter()
for _ in range(N): parse_structure(path)
parse_ms = 1000 * (time.perf_counter() - t) / N

# Component B: generate only (over already-parsed structures)
parsed = [parse_structure(path) for _ in range(N)]
t = time.perf_counter()
for s in parsed: generate_one(s, ...)
gen_ms = 1000 * (time.perf_counter() - t) / N

# Component C: end-to-end
# ... and check that parse_ms + gen_ms ≈ end_to_end_ms (often it doesn't,
# which is itself the finding: something in the glue is non-trivial).
```

If your end-to-end is 7 ms/doc and your isolated parse + generate sum
to 5 ms/doc, the missing 2 ms is somewhere in the glue (per-row
dataclass churn, dict construction, JSON serialization, etc.). That's
where the next optimization opportunity lives, not in parse or
generate themselves.

### 4. Multi-trial measurement; report min + median

Single-shot wall-clock numbers are noisy: cold caches, JIT-ish warmups,
GC, system load. **Run ≥ 5 trials and report min + median.** First-run
inflation can be 20-50 %; pretending the first run is representative
will send you optimizing the wrong thing.

```python
trials = [time_one_run() for _ in range(5)]
print(f"min={min(trials):.2f}  median={sorted(trials)[2]:.2f}  trials={trials}")
```

Use **min** as the "true" cost (least noise added) and **median** as
"typical." When they diverge significantly, something in your
environment is variable and worth fixing before continuing: background
processes, disk cache state, and so on.

### 5. Hypothesis-driven changes: predict, then measure, then report

For each optimization, **predict the win before implementing it** and
write the prediction down. Then measure. There are three possible
outcomes.

If the predicted win materialized, ship it, and update the skill if
the lesson generalizes.

If the predicted win was wrong (smaller, or zero), roll back. This
is the most important branch. The temptation to keep the change
because it's "cleaner" or "more correct in principle" leaks
complexity into the codebase for no measurable benefit.

If the predicted win was wrong in an interesting way (a different
bottleneck surfaced), keep the prediction in your notes. The gap
between expected and measured is itself a finding about where the
cost actually lives.

A worked example of the rollback branch: splitting a hot Python loop
into "pre-compute integer indices, then do the math in vectorized
numpy" *sounds* faster. But for batch sizes in the low thousands,
per-element numpy access has fixed overhead comparable to ~12 scalar
Python ops, and the gains from vectorization get eaten by the
Python-side cost of building the plan arrays. The right move when
the measurement comes back flat is to revert, even when the rewrite
looks more elegant. The finding (that there's a crossover point
below which Python beats numpy for per-element access) is the
keeper; the rewrite isn't.

### When to stop

You're done optimizing when the remaining cost is one of these.

1. Real network latency. `cat_file` of a 50 KB object across the
   internet has a floor. Add concurrency, not cleverness.
2. C-extension parse cost (gemmi, pyconfind). Python can't help
   here; the GIL is already released, and you're competing with C.
3. Algorithmic floor. The doc generator inherently has to do O(N²)
   contact work over N residues; you can vectorize but not avoid it.
4. The cluster's wall-clock is now bounded by something else. At
   some point shaving 0.5 ms/doc off a 4 ms/doc pipeline saves
   ~minutes on a 30-minute run, and cluster startup overhead and
   Zephyr scheduling start dominating. Below that threshold, the
   return on more profiling is essentially zero.

Each of these is a fine stopping point. The goal is fitting the
budget the experiment needs, not maximizing theoretical throughput.
If your projected wall-clock is already under the user's tolerance,
**don't optimize**; the time you'd spend has better uses.

## Neural / accelerator tokenizers (when the model is the cost)

The sections above assume I/O dominates. When the per-row work is a neural
forward pass on an accelerator, that assumption can invert — but **measure
before you believe it**. Profile one row (the "Project before optimizing" step
above) and confirm the encoder forward, not the GCS GET, is the bottleneck; a
small model behind slow I/O can still be I/O-bound. If compute wins, the
decisions below apply. exp40 (bio2token, a bidirectional Mamba encoder on TPU)
is the worked example throughout; its measured shape:

| step | cost | note |
|---|---|---|
| GCS GET + gemmi parse + adapt | ~2.5 ms/doc | negligible |
| **encoder forward (the tokens), CPU** | **~0.19 ms/atom on 1 thread** (≈ 450 ms for a 2,350-atom mean protein) | dominates by ~100× |
| encoder forward, one v6e TPU chip | ~0.34 s/doc steady-state; **+~40 s one-time XLA compile per length bucket** | compile dominates *short* runs |

The first three decisions below are general to any neural tokenizer; the last
applies only to models with a sequential recurrence.

### Batch onto the accelerator — don't thread-per-row

The I/O-bound pattern (`thread_per_row_in_shard`) runs one row per thread to
overlap each fetch with its compute. For accelerator inference that's the wrong
shape: throughput comes from **batching many inputs into one forward pass**
(B=1 starves a systolic array), not from concurrent single-item forwards. So the
shard body becomes two phases, not one interleaved pool:

- **fetch + parse concurrently** (still I/O-bound — a thread pool earns its keep), then
- **one batched forward pass per bucket** on the accelerator.

The knob that matters is `--max-batch` (it bounds device memory), not
`--fetch-concurrency`.

```python
def generate_shard(items, shard_info, *, device, max_batch, ...):
    rows = list(items)
    # Concurrent fetch + parse (I/O-bound).
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=min(fetch_concurrency, len(rows))) as pool:
        parsed = [p for p in pool.map(fetch_and_parse, rows) if p is not None]
    # ONE batched forward pass per length bucket — the throughput lever.
    docs = tokenize_batched([p.structure for p in parsed], model, device, max_batch)
    # Assemble + yield in input order.
```

One extra reason thread-per-row can *actively* backfire: if the model's forward
holds the GIL, N threads serialize to ~1×. exp40's pure-Python Mamba scan is a
`for t in range(L)` loop that does exactly this — but most models do their heavy
work in GIL-releasing kernels, so this particular failure is model-dependent.
The batching conclusion holds either way; don't lean on the GIL to justify it.

### Static-length bucketing (variable-length inputs on XLA)

Only relevant when your inputs are **variable-length** and you're on **XLA/TPU**
(a fixed-shape tokenizer — e.g. image patches — skips this). XLA compiles one
executable per input shape, so feeding raw lengths triggers a fresh multi-second
compile for every distinct length — the job never finishes compiling. **Pad each
input up to the smallest length in a short geometric ladder** (exp40:
`256, 512, …, 16384`) so a whole run compiles only `~len(BUCKETS)` graphs.
Oversized inputs fall back to their exact length (one rare extra compile) —
never dropped or truncated.

**If you pad, prove it's a no-op.** Padding is free only if padded positions
can't change real positions' outputs — and *how* they might leak is
architecture-specific: attention over padded keys, normalization statistics
computed across padding, a bidirectional model's backward receptive field.
Whatever your model, mask the padding and **pin it with a test that padded +
batched outputs are bit-for-bit equal to the unpadded ones** — don't reason
about the leak, assert its absence. (exp40's leak was a conv1d **bias** plus the
backward scan of a bidirectional stack; the guard is `tests/test_bucketing.py`.)

### Compile once per worker; warm a shared cache for the fleet

The "memoize heavy init per worker" rule is doubly load-bearing on an
accelerator: the checkpoint load **and** the first XLA compile (one per bucket)
happen once per worker, cached in a module global. Raise
`ZephyrContext(heartbeat_timeout=...)` well above the 120 s default so a cold
compile isn't declared dead. A *short* run is dominated by that compile (exp40
smoke: 74 s for 100 docs, mostly compile); only a run long enough to amortize it
shows the real per-doc rate. For a many-worker full run, warm a **shared
persistent XLA compile cache on GCS** once (a 1-VM job over one input per bucket)
so "≈`len(BUCKETS)` compiles × N workers" collapses to "≈`len(BUCKETS)` compiles,
once." You cannot AOT the TPU compile on a CPU/GPU CI runner — the executable is
keyed to the TPU generation + libtpu version, so it must compile on that TPU.

### If your model has a sequential recurrence (SSM / RNN / linear attention)

Transformers and CNNs can skip this one. A model that scans the length axis with
a recurrence — a state-space model (Mamba), an RNN, or linear attention — has a
`for t in range(L)` step that is correct under XLA but **unrolls into an L-deep
graph** (thousands of ops × layers × directions): enormous compile, slow
executable. Rewrite the linear recurrence `h_t = a_t·h_{t-1} + b_t` as a
Hillis-Steele associative scan over the affine-map operator
`(a₂,b₂)∘(a₁,b₁) = (a₂·a₁, a₂·b₁+b₂)`: log₂(L) vectorized steps, a compact graph.
Assert it matches the sequential recurrence to float eps (exp40
`tests/test_scan.py`). On CPU it's ~3× *slower* (O(L·logL) work) — fine; it's the
TPU executable you're optimizing, and local dev stays correct.

## Provisioning TPU workers on Iris (fray `ResourceConfig.with_tpu`)

CPU pipelines pass `ResourceConfig(cpu=, ram=, disk=, regions=, preemptible=)`.
For TPU workers the accelerator lives in the `device` field — use the builder,
and keep the launcher (`iris job run`) a tiny CPU coordinator:

```python
ctx = ZephyrContext(
    max_workers=args.max_workers,
    resources=ResourceConfig.with_tpu(
        "v6e-4",                     # a real marin pool + zone (see traps below)
        zone="us-east5-b",
        regions=["us-east5"],        # PIN — else the worker inherits the launcher's region
        preemptible=True,
    ),
    coordinator_resources=ResourceConfig(cpu=1, ram="2g"),
    heartbeat_timeout=600.0,         # absorb cold XLA compile
)
```

```bash
# Launcher is CPU-only; --extra tpu makes workers `uv sync` the torch_xla wheel.
uv run iris --cluster=marin job run --cpu 1 --memory 2GB --extra tpu -- \
    python cli.py generate --device xla --tpu-type v6e-4 --zone us-east5-b ...
```

Worker-side torch_xla init (Iris injects `PJRT_DEVICE=TPU` per task — no env
setup), loading the model once per worker:

```python
import torch_xla
dev = torch_xla.device()
model = load_model().to(dev).eval()          # module global; once per worker
tokens = model.tokenize(coords.to(dev), mask.to(dev))
torch_xla.sync()                             # flush the lazy graph each batch
tokens = tokens.to("cpu")
```

### TPU traps the exp40 smoke surfaced (all silent-until-scheduled)

- **`[dependency-groups] dev` must exist**, or iris's runtime `uv sync --group
  dev` aborts and *no deps install* — the worker dies on the first third-party
  `import` (looks like a missing-package bug; is a total sync failure). Add
  `[dependency-groups]\ndev = []` + `[tool.uv] prerelease = "allow"` + a
  dual-platform `environments` list (matches exp53).
- **Pin `regions` consistently with `zone`.** `ResourceConfig.regions=None` (the
  default) means *inherit the launcher job's region*. Launcher in `us-central2` +
  pinned `zone=us-central1-a` → contradictory constraint →
  `unschedulable: no groups in zone`. Pass `regions=[zone-minus-suffix]`.
- **Get `(tpu_type, zone)` from the live cluster config, not the `TpuType`
  Literal.** marin's pools live in `iris/config/marin.yaml → tpu_pools`; the
  Literal lists sizes/zones the cluster doesn't offer. And **preemptible pools
  contend**: v5p-8 sat `pending` ("…has sufficient [capacity]") for 10+ min;
  the far larger **v6e-preemptible** pool (us-east5-b) scheduled instantly.
  Prefer a big pool and co-locate `--out` (and, ideally, the input manifest)
  with its zone's region — that also keeps egress at zero.
- **A v6e-4 / v5p-8 VM is 4 chips; one Python worker uses chip 0** — 3 idle.
  Accept for a first correctness run; fan out (SPMD, or 4 workers/VM) only if
  measured throughput needs it.

## Pre-launch checklist

Before triggering the full run, verify each of these:

**Per-row**
- [ ] Object bytes are fetched via
      `marinfold.document_structures.io.read_object_bytes` (or
      equivalent: a full `cat_file` GET that handles gzip-transcoded
      objects), not `fsspec.open().read()` with size inference.
- [ ] The worker **raises** on I/O / parse / generate failures (the
      default behavior of the library helpers). Killing one Zephyr
      worker is much cheaper than silently shipping a corrupted
      training corpus. Only return ``None`` for *designed-in filter
      predicates* (multi-chain when single-chain is required,
      structure too small to fit the context budget, etc.), where the
      "no output" outcome is a known-and-expected property of the
      input, not a swallowed error. If your pipeline genuinely needs
      lenient mode for a specific failure mode, opt in explicitly at
      the call site (`read_object_bytes(uri, missing_ok=True)`) and
      add a comment explaining why.

**Per-shard**
- [ ] URI-path `map_shard` body delegates to
      `marinfold.document_structures.io.thread_per_row_in_shard` (or
      equivalent: a thread pool sized at `min(concurrency, len(rows))`
      that yields in input order and skips `None`); inline-cif path
      runs sequentially (no I/O to overlap, pool is pure overhead).
- [ ] Any heavy per-process init (parsed libraries, JIT kernels) is
      memoized at module scope with a sentinel, not re-run per shard.

**Per-job**
- [ ] `--worker-cpu 1`, `--worker-memory` set to peak working set + a
      small margin (4 GB is fine for most gemmi/numpy workers).
- [ ] `--max-workers` set explicitly. Default `None` means cluster
      default, which may be too small for a full run.
- [ ] `--region` pinned to the cluster's region (default `us-central1`
      for the marin Iris cluster), `--preemptible` on by default.
- [ ] Output bucket is `gs://marin-<same-region>/protein-structure/MarinFold/<exp>/`.

**Per-input / per-output**
- [ ] Input parquet is read with `columns=…` projected to only what the
      worker needs (one schema peek at submission time).
- [ ] `--out` contains `{shard:05d}-of-{total:05d}` for the full run;
      smoke runs may omit it.

**Neural / accelerator tokenizer (only if the per-row work is model inference)**
- [ ] Shard body is **two-phase** (concurrent fetch+parse → one *batched*
      forward pass per bucket), not `thread_per_row` — accelerator throughput
      comes from batching, not concurrent single-item forwards.
- [ ] Variable-length inputs are **length-bucketed** to a short fixed ladder so
      XLA compiles `~len(BUCKETS)` graphs, not one per distinct length.
- [ ] If you pad for bucketing, a test asserts **padded+batched outputs ==
      unpadded outputs** bit-for-bit (mask the padding; leak vectors are
      architecture-specific).
- [ ] Worker requests a TPU via `ResourceConfig.with_tpu(type, zone=,
      regions=[zone-region], preemptible=)`; `(type, zone)` come from
      `marin.yaml → tpu_pools` (a real, non-contended pool), and `--out` +
      manifest are co-located with that region (zero egress).
- [ ] `[dependency-groups] dev = []` present; `heartbeat_timeout` raised for
      cold compile; model loaded once per worker at module scope.

**Validation**
- [ ] Local unit tests pass.
- [ ] Iris smoke run (`--num-docs 100`, single input shard): **every
      input row is accounted for**. A row either yields output, or
      matches a designed-in filter predicate that returns ``None``
      (multi-chain structure, too small to fit the context budget,
      etc.). No swallowed exceptions: under the fail-loud default,
      a smoke run that completes without crashing means there were
      no I/O / parse / generate failures. The smoke set is small
      enough to enumerate every dropped row and confirm it matches
      a filter predicate, not a sample.
- [ ] Measured per-doc latency on the smoke matches the projection
      within ~2×; large gaps mean either the smoke isn't
      representative or the projection's assumptions are wrong.
- [ ] Smoke output sample manually inspected for shape + content.
- [ ] User has gated the full run.

If any of these is missing, fix it before scaling out. The cost of
an unnecessary full run on 512 preemptible workers is real (cluster
capacity and $), and the cost of *finding out at hour 3* that you
needed the gzip-safe reader is worse.

---

## When you're done

After the full run completes:

1. Record the measured per-doc rate + wall-clock + worker count + region in
   the experiment's README "Results" section. Include the output GCS URI.
2. Commit a `data/timings.csv` (per the root `AGENTS.md` "Capture timings
   for every predictor run" rule).
3. If you discovered a new trap not in this skill, *open a PR adding
   it here*. The cost of writing it down is much less than the cost
   of the next agent rediscovering it.
