# MoonSpec Verify

Use this skill to perform the final MoonSpec verification workflow.

## Scope

Verify only. Do not modify source code, tests, specs, plans, tasks, docs, migrations, or configuration. Normal disposable test artifacts are acceptable only when already ignored by the project.

This skill answers:

- Does the implementation satisfy the original request or declarative design?
- Is the bounded verification scope fully implemented?
- Do unit tests and integration tests provide credible evidence?
- Which requirements, scenarios, source design mappings, or AGENTS.md principles remain partial, missing, conflicting, or unverified?
- Which stable canonical source claims are covered by implementation behavior, test evidence, artifact evidence, or a clear gap reason?
- Did verified implementation evidence contradict claims in the canonical source document, indicating doc drift that reconciliation must handle?

## Source Acceptance Matrix Verification

When `artifacts/moonspec/source-acceptance.json` or `artifacts/moonspec/acceptance-assessment.json` exists and its `featureId`, source, feature directory, issue reference, or requirement IDs match the selected verification baseline, verify every repo-verifiable source row for that baseline. Do not choose `FULLY_IMPLEMENTED` unless every required repo-verifiable source row for the selected baseline is satisfied. In source-direct verification mode, ignore stale or unrelated acceptance artifacts whose source metadata does not match the selected source.

## Inputs

- Treat explicitly identified original implementation instructions as a valid verification baseline, not merely optional focus.
- Treat a referenced declarative document as a valid verification baseline. Read it directly and verify its in-scope desired-state claims without requiring a derived MoonSpec feature packet.
- Do not treat ad hoc verifier guidance, such as "focus on API tests", workflow meta-instructions, or review-process instructions, as the verification baseline when an issue brief, `spec.md`, feature directory, original implementation request, or declarative source is available. Use that guidance only to prioritize evidence gathering within the real baseline.
- In issue-brief verification mode, use the provided issue brief artifact, issue reference, acceptance criteria, and assessment artifact as the verification baseline without requiring a MoonSpec feature directory, `spec.md`, `plan.md`, or `tasks.md`.
- When an active feature directory or `spec.md` exists, use it as optional derived context and traceability. `plan.md` and `tasks.md` are also optional process context; their absence is never by itself a verification gap.
- Read `AGENTS.md` when present for project principles, repo constraints, and test discipline.
- Use absolute paths in reports.
- Keep the verdict conservative when evidence is incomplete.

Stop only when no usable verification baseline can be located or the available baseline is genuinely too ambiguous to bound. Do not choose `NO_DETERMINATION`, `BLOCKED`, or `ADDITIONAL_WORK_NEEDED` solely because `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, or other derived MoonSpec artifacts are absent. If an optional `spec.md` contains multiple stories and no narrower original instruction or declarative scope is available, report `NO_DETERMINATION` and recommend splitting the design with `/moonspec.breakdown` or selecting a narrower verification target.

## Pre-Verify Hooks

Before verification, check for extension hooks:

1. If `.specify/extensions.yml` exists, read it and look for `hooks.before_verify`.
2. If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently.
3. Ignore hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`; hooks without `enabled` are enabled.
4. Do not evaluate non-empty `condition` expressions. Treat hooks with no condition, null condition, or empty condition as executable. Skip hooks with non-empty conditions.
5. For each executable hook:
   - Optional hook (`optional: true`): print:

```markdown
## Extension Hooks

**Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
Command: `/{command}`
Description: {description}

Prompt: {prompt}
To execute: `/{command}`
```

   - Mandatory hook (`optional: false`): print:

```markdown
## Extension Hooks

**Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
Executing: `/{command}`
EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to verification.
```

If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently.

## Setup

Resolve the verification baseline in this order:

1. Explicit original implementation instructions or an explicitly referenced declarative document in the current request or workflow step.
2. Issue-brief verification inputs.
3. An explicitly provided `spec.md` or feature directory.
4. An active feature directory discovered from repository context by running `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only`.

The first usable source defines the bounded scope. Later sources are supplemental context and traceability only. Workflow-stage prose such as "run the final gate", ad hoc verifier guidance such as "focus on API tests", or other process instructions are operational guidance, not source-direct authority; do not let them outrank an explicit feature directory, `spec.md`, original request, issue brief, declarative source document, or discovered active-feature source. When a canonical declarative document and a derived artifact conflict, follow `docs/Workflows/MoonSpecDocumentModel.md`: the canonical document wins unless verified evidence requires reconciliation.

In source-direct verification mode:

1. Preserve the original instruction text or declarative document path as the report's authority reference.
2. Extract requirements, acceptance-critical behavior, constraints, stable claim IDs, explicit non-goals, and test expectations directly from that source.
3. Bound verification to the requested change or the in-scope claims named by the instructions. Do not require unrelated claims from a broad document.
4. Inspect production code and tests directly. Discover test commands from `AGENTS.md`, README, build configuration, CI configuration, and repository conventions when no plan or task packet is available.
5. Do not require a MoonSpec feature directory, `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, a source-acceptance artifact, or an assessment artifact.

If the user provides issue-brief verification inputs, use issue-brief verification mode. Accept inputs expressed in prose or preset instructions such as:

- issue provider, for example `jira` or `github`
- issue reference, for example `MM-1063` or `owner/repo#123`
- issue brief artifact path, such as `artifacts/jira-implement-brief.json`
- assessment artifact path, such as `artifacts/jira-implement-assessment.json`

In issue-brief verification mode:

1. Read the issue brief artifact and assessment artifact.
2. Use the issue summary, description, acceptance criteria, loaded preset brief, and the assessment's unmet and partially-met requirements as the verification baseline.
3. Treat a `PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED` assessment as a bounded backlog: verify only the previously unmet or partially met requirements unless the issue brief explicitly requires broader validation.
4. Treat `FULLY_IMPLEMENTED` as already verified only when no implementation step made code changes after that assessment.
5. Inspect production code and tests directly; do not treat the assessment itself as proof that new work is complete.
6. Do not require `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, or a standalone constitution file.

## Controlling vs Advisory Verification

Separate verification evidence into controlling and advisory classes before choosing the verdict.

Controlling evidence can block `FULLY_IMPLEMENTED`:

- direct production-code inspection for every in-scope requirement.
- unit, compile, typecheck, lint, and other repo-local hermetic checks that exercise in-scope behavior and can run with the checked-out repository plus documented local dependencies.
- hermetic integration tests when their required fixtures, services, and assets are present in the current runtime and the failure identifies a concrete in-scope implementation defect.
- explicit original-instruction, declarative-document, AGENTS.md, issue-brief, or spec `MUST` requirements that are repo-verifiable in the current runtime.

Advisory evidence must be reported but must not fail verification by itself:

- integration, e2e, smoke, quickstart, map-entry, UI/browser, deployment, or external-service tests that require credentials, host services, deployed environments, proprietary or binary assets, large fixtures, game/editor map assets, simulators, or other runtime inputs not available in the checkout.
- failures whose root cause is the unavailable advisory environment, such as missing `.umap` files, absent `/Game/Maps/...` assets, unavailable services, or unsupported local tools.
- manual-only checks, production deployment checks, or provider-specific validation unavailable to the verifier.

When an advisory command is unavailable or fails for an advisory-environment reason, classify the command as `NOT RUN` when detected before execution, or as `FAIL` with a clearly marked non-blocking advisory note when discovered by running it. Record the missing asset, service, fixture, or environment condition in Test Results, Gaps, Diagnostics, or residual risk, but do not put it in Remaining Work and do not choose `ADDITIONAL_WORK_NEEDED`, `NO_DETERMINATION`, or `BLOCKED` solely for that reason.

If an integration or e2e command failure reveals a concrete in-scope implementation defect that can be fixed in the repository, classify and gate on that underlying defect, not on the suite label. If the implementation, controlling tests, source claims, AGENTS.md principles, and original request alignment all verify, `FULLY_IMPLEMENTED` is allowed even when advisory integration/e2e/map smoke evidence is missing or non-blocking.

If the user provides a specific `spec.md` or feature directory, use it and discover sibling artifacts from that directory when present.

To discover any active feature directory or optional derived context, run the prerequisite script from the repository root in paths-only mode. This discovery is non-blocking and must not replace an already selected source-direct, issue-brief, `spec.md`, or feature-directory baseline:

```bash
.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only
```

If it succeeds, parse `FEATURE_DIR`, then discover whichever sibling artifacts exist:

- `SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md`
- `PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md`
- `TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md`
- optional docs such as `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`, and `checklists/`
- `REPO_GUIDANCE = AGENTS.md` when present

If discovery fails because no active feature exists, the feature directory is absent, or derived artifacts such as `plan.md` or `tasks.md` are missing, continue with any usable selected baseline already available. Derived-artifact discovery failure is not itself a verification failure.

If shell arguments contain single quotes, use shell-safe escaping such as `'I'\''m Groot'`, or double quotes when possible.

## Workspace Projection Preflight

Before running full-suite verification commands, ensure the repository view is not contaminated by a MoonMind active skill projection:

```bash
test ! -L .agents/skills
test ! -L .gemini/skills
test ! -e skills_active || test -L skills_active
git status --porcelain -- .agents/skills .gemini/skills skills_active
```

If `.agents/skills` or `.gemini/skills` is an active projection symlink, repair the checkout view before running full-suite evidence. Prefer restoring the tracked repository files or using a clean reclone/worktree. If repair is not possible in the current runtime, stop with verdict `BLOCKED`, include the diagnostic `ENVIRONMENT_CONTAMINATED_BY_SKILL_PROJECTION`, set `recoverableInCurrentRuntime: false`, set `recommendedNextAction: blocked`, and do not report `NO_DETERMINATION` merely because MoonMind's active projection masked tracked skill files.

Real repo-authored `.agents/skills` directories are valid source input and must not be deleted, moved, or treated as the active selected skill snapshot.

## Load Verification Sources

In source-direct verification mode, read:

- the original instruction text and every explicitly referenced declarative source needed for the bounded scope.
- `AGENTS.md` and README when present for project constraints and documented verification commands.
- relevant production code, tests, build files, CI configuration, contracts, and runtime wiring discovered from the source requirements.
- optional feature artifacts only when they exist and add useful traceability.

In MoonSpec feature-directory mode, read when present:

- `spec.md`: original request in `**Input**`, the single user story, independent test, acceptance scenarios or `SCN-*`, functional requirements `FR-*`, success criteria `SC-*`, edge cases, assumptions, key entities, and source design mappings such as `DESIGN-REQ-*` or `DOC-REQ-*`.
- `plan.md`: intended architecture, project structure, Principles Check, test commands, test tooling, integration dependencies, and constraints. Treat as optional context, not proof.
- `tasks.md`: expected file paths, sequencing, test commands, and process completion. Treat as optional process evidence only, not implementation proof.
- `AGENTS.md` when present: project principles, repo constraints, `MUST` rules, and testing discipline.
- `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`, and `checklists/` when present and relevant.
- `specs/breakdown.md` when source design coverage or cross-spec dependencies matter.
- The canonical source document named by `spec.md` `**Source Document**` when present, plus `artifacts/doc-discoveries/<feature>.json` when it exists, so source-document drift can be assessed.

Do not use copied source requirement text in `spec.md` as evidence that behavior exists.

In issue-brief verification mode, read:

- the issue brief artifact: issue key or GitHub issue ref, title, description, acceptance criteria, loaded preset brief, constraints, and source-resolution metadata when present.
- the assessment artifact: verdict, per-requirement statuses, unmet requirements, partially met requirements, blocking evidence, and summary.
- changed production and test files relevant to the issue brief and assessment gaps.
- local implementation artifacts named by the preset, such as pull request handoff artifacts or verification reports, only as process context.

Do not use the issue brief, assessment, or generated handoff text as evidence that behavior exists.

## Canonical Claim Coverage

When a canonical source document is present, report first-class Canonical Claim Coverage over stable canonical claims from that source while preserving the existing Source Document Drift section for reconciliation handoff.

Build the claim inventory from the canonical source document's stable claim headings and durable claim anchors, such as `DOC-REQ-*`, `CONTRACT-*`, `INV-*`, `NON-GOAL-*`, `QUALITY-*`, and `TEST-*`. Use temporary `DESIGN-REQ-*` values only as source-issue traceability, not as stable canonical claim IDs. Preserve source issue traceability or related coverage IDs when the canonical document provides it, but do not treat traceability prose as proof of behavior.

For each in-scope canonical claim, classify the result with separate fields for:

- Implementation status: `VERIFIED`, `PARTIAL`, `MISSING`, `CONFLICT`, or `NO_DETERMINATION`.
- Verification status: `VERIFIED`, `PARTIAL`, `MISSING`, `CONFLICT`, or `NO_DETERMINATION`.
- Drift status: `NONE`, `POSSIBLE_DOC_DRIFT`, or `DEFINITE_DOC_DRIFT`.

Each claim row must include at least one durable reference in one of these fields:

- Code evidence, such as repository file paths with line numbers or named code symbols.
- Test evidence, such as test file paths, test names, and command results.
- Artifact evidence, such as artifact refs, discovery ledger paths, diagnostics refs, or report refs.
- Gap reason, when evidence is missing, ambiguous, contradictory, or out of scope.

Classify gaps separately:

- Implementation gaps mean required behavior or wiring is absent, partial, or contradictory.
- Verification gaps mean tests, command evidence, or inspection evidence are missing or insufficient.
- Doc drift means verified behavior contradicts, supersedes, or reveals ambiguity in the canonical source document.

Doc drift alone does not block `FULLY_IMPLEMENTED` when implementation behavior and required verification are correct for the agreed story scope. In that case, set the claim's drift status and also record the structured drift in Source Document Drift for `moonspec-doc-reconcile`.

Use durable evidence references instead of pasting large source, code, test, artifact, or log content into the report.

## Verification Inventory

Build an internal inventory before inspecting code:

- One row per explicit source-direct requirement or stable declarative claim in scope.
- One row per `FR-*` when a spec provides them.
- One row per acceptance scenario or `SCN-*` when present.
- One row per observable success criterion or `SC-*` when present.
- One row per edge case that affects behavior.
- One row per relevant AGENTS.md principle, repo constraint, or testing-discipline item that affects implementation or verification.
- One row per in-scope `DESIGN-REQ-*` or `DOC-REQ-*`.
- One row per stable canonical source claim in scope for the story.
- In issue-brief verification mode, one row per acceptance criterion and one row per unmet or partially met assessment requirement.

For each row, track:

- Expected behavior.
- Likely production code touchpoints.
- Expected unit test evidence.
- Expected integration test evidence.
- Current status.
- Concrete evidence.
- Remaining gap.
- For canonical claims, separate implementation gaps, verification gaps, and doc drift.

## Inspect Evidence

Inspect production code before tests so behavior is verified directly.

Use repository search to find:

- Requirement terms.
- Entity names.
- DTOs, commands, endpoint paths, CLI names, UI routes, event names, or public APIs.
- Config keys, migration names, service registrations, background jobs, middleware, persistence code, and external integrations.
- Test names and fixtures tied to `FR-*`, `SCN-*`, success criteria, contracts, or source design IDs.

Evidence rules:

- Production behavior must exist for each functional requirement.
- Startup wiring, registration, configuration binding, routing, migrations, contracts, background jobs, external services, and persistence must be inspected when required behavior depends on them.
- Unit tests should cover domain rules, transformations, validation, edge cases, and failure modes.
- Integration tests should cover acceptance scenarios, workflows, contracts, persistence, external interfaces, CLI/API/UI wiring, and other system interactions.
- Comments, TODOs, dead code, unreferenced helpers, and documentation-only changes are non-evidence unless the requirement is explicitly documentation-only.
- Implementation must not add hidden scope that contradicts the original request, source design, spec, or relevant repo guidance.

## Run Verification Commands

Run commands when available and safe:

- Unit test commands from `AGENTS.md`, README, build or CI configuration, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, quickstart, or project conventions.
- Integration test commands from `AGENTS.md`, README, build or CI configuration, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, quickstart, or project conventions.
- Quickstart validation when executable and safe.
- Build, lint, or typecheck commands when they are part of the documented validation path or needed to resolve ambiguity.

Record exact command results as `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `NOT RUN`.

Use `NOT RUN` with an exact reason when a command requires unavailable credentials, missing services, unsafe side effects, unsupported local tools, or excessive environment setup.
Use the controlling/advisory split when interpreting results. Missing map assets, game/editor content assets, external services, credentials, or other non-hermetic integration/e2e prerequisites are advisory limitations unless the command output exposes a concrete in-scope implementation defect.

## Classify Items

Use these statuses:

- `VERIFIED`: implementation and validation evidence satisfy the item.
- `PARTIAL`: some implementation exists, but behavior, wiring, or test coverage is incomplete.
- `MISSING`: no meaningful implementation evidence exists.
- `CONFLICT`: implementation contradicts the spec, original request, source design, or relevant repo guidance.
- `NO_DETERMINATION`: evidence is too ambiguous or unavailable to make a defensible call.

Rules:

- Do not mark the feature `FULLY_IMPLEMENTED` unless every in-scope source requirement, relevant AGENTS.md principle, source design requirement, and acceptance-critical behavior is `VERIFIED`.
- Missing required unit tests or repo-local hermetic checks is a verification failure unless the selected verification baseline clearly makes that test class irrelevant.
- Missing integration coverage for acceptance scenarios, contracts, workflows, persistence, or external boundaries is a high-severity gap only when that coverage is repo-local, hermetic, and controllable in the current runtime. Integration/e2e/map/deployment evidence that depends on unavailable assets or external runtime fixtures is advisory and non-blocking.
- Separate missing implementation from missing validation when both matter.
- Treat violated AGENTS.md `MUST` rules as blocking failures.
- Treat original request misalignment as blocking even if later tasks are complete.
- Source-document drift alone does not block `FULLY_IMPLEMENTED` when the implementation is correct per the agreed story scope; record it in the Source Document Drift section as structured input for `moonspec-doc-reconcile`. Drift becomes blocking only when it reveals the implementation itself contradicts agreed scope.
- Canonical claim doc drift alone follows the same rule: it is non-blocking when behavior and verification are correct, but implementation gaps and verification gaps remain blocking until resolved or explicitly out of scope.

## Verdict

Choose exactly one verdict:

- `FULLY_IMPLEMENTED`: implementation, unit tests, repo-local hermetic checks, source design requirements, relevant AGENTS.md principles, and original request alignment all verify.
- `ADDITIONAL_WORK_NEEDED`: concrete implementation or validation gaps remain.
- `NO_DETERMINATION`: required evidence cannot be inspected or commands cannot be run enough to reach a defensible conclusion.
- `BLOCKED`: the execution environment prevents trustworthy verification, such as `ENVIRONMENT_CONTAMINATED_BY_SKILL_PROJECTION` from the workspace projection preflight. Include the diagnostic, whether it is recoverable in the current runtime, and the minimum repair needed.

Prefer `ADDITIONAL_WORK_NEEDED` over `NO_DETERMINATION` when a concrete missing code or test gap is visible. Use `BLOCKED` only for environment failures; it says nothing about implementation completeness.
Do not choose a blocking verdict solely because advisory integration/e2e/map/deployment validation cannot run or fails due to unavailable non-repo assets, services, credentials, or tooling. Use `FULLY_IMPLEMENTED` when all controlling evidence verifies; otherwise gate only on concrete implementation or controllable verification gaps.

When the verdict is `ADDITIONAL_WORK_NEEDED`, include a structured Remaining Work section that remediation steps can consume. Each item must identify:

- requirement or acceptance criterion
- gap type: `implementation`, `verification`, `documentation`, or `environment`
- concrete remaining work
- suggested files, commands, or evidence to inspect
- whether the gap is recoverable in the current runtime

Distinguish implementation gaps from verification gaps:

- Implementation gaps mean required behavior, wiring, persistence, contracts, UI/API behavior, or configuration is absent, partial, or contradictory.
- Verification gaps mean tests, command evidence, fixture coverage, integration evidence, or inspectable artifacts are missing or insufficient.
- Environment gaps mean current-runtime constraints prevent a controlling repo-verifiable check and should usually map to `BLOCKED` or `NO_DETERMINATION` depending on recoverability. Environment gaps for advisory integration/e2e/map/deployment evidence are non-blocking limitations, not Remaining Work.

Emit concrete `remainingWork` for every `ADDITIONAL_WORK_NEEDED` result. Each item must be bounded enough for a remediation step to act on without reinterpreting the whole report.

```

## Decision

```

Keep the report evidence-backed and concise. Cite file paths and line numbers when possible.

## Post-Verify Hooks

After reporting, check `.specify/extensions.yml` for `hooks.after_verify` using the same parsing, filtering, and condition rules as pre-verify hooks. For each executable hook:

- Optional hook (`optional: true`): print:

```markdown
## Extension Hooks

**Optional Hook**: {extension}
Command: `/{command}`
Description: {description}

Prompt: {prompt}
To execute: `/{command}`
```

- Mandatory hook (`optional: false`): print:

```markdown
## Extension Hooks

**Automatic Hook**: {extension}
Executing: `/{command}`
EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
```

If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently.

## Key Rules

- Verification is read-only except ignored disposable test artifacts.
- Original instructions, a declarative source document, an issue brief, or an optional `spec.md` may define the bounded verification scope.
- `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` are disposable derived artifacts. Their absence never blocks verification when another usable baseline exists.
- When `spec.md` names a canonical source document, interpret the story against that document's in-scope stable claims; the canonical document remains the durable desired-state authority unless verified drift is handed off to doc reconciliation.
- Do not require unrelated claims from a larger canonical design to verify for this story, but do not let the temporary spec silently override an in-scope canonical conflict.
- Relevant AGENTS.md guidance defines repo principles, constraints, and test discipline for the story.
- `plan.md` and `tasks.md` are useful context but never proof of implementation.
- Unit tests and repo-local hermetic checks are controlling expected evidence. Integration/e2e/map/deployment checks are expected evidence when available, but they are advisory and non-blocking when they depend on unavailable non-repo assets, services, credentials, or tooling.
- Prefer direct, citeable repository evidence from production code, wiring, configuration, and tests.
- Do not mark the feature complete when required behavior is only inferred and not verified.
