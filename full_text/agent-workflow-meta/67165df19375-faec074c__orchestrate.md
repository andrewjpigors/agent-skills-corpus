# orchestrate

Turn a project's ready-for-agent issues into finished code without supervision: the orchestrator reads the issues and their agent briefs, plans from their dependency graph, and drives a fleet of sub-agents through implement → independently verify → integrate, then hands you one consolidated report of what shipped and what still needs a human. It owns the quality bar and the decisions; it never writes production code or reads diffs itself. It stops short of releasing — bump, tag, and platform release stay with the `release` skill.

This is an outward-facing, autonomous run: it spawns many sub-agents and, when authorized, integrates code. It shares the *when in doubt, ask* posture of `release` and `push` — trigger on `/orchestrate` or an unmistakable request to build the issues with sub-agents, never on a vague "implement this". A single confirmation gate stands before the run begins; beyond it, nothing waits on you.

The plugin root holds the pieces this skill uses. This skill lives at `skills/orchestrate/`; the plugin root is two levels up (also `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`). Reach them there: the deterministic helper `scripts/orchestrate.py` (run with `uv run`) and the engine `skills/orchestrate/orchestrate.workflow.js` (run through the Workflow tool).

## Cost model — read this first

The work must land in the **interactive subscription pool**, not the headless credit pool. So:

- **Every sub-agent runs inside the interactive session**, through the **Workflow tool** (preferred) or the **Agent tool** (fallback). Both count against the Max subscription, the same as this session.
- **Never wrap the run in `claude -p`.** Headless invocation draws from the separate, API-priced monthly credit that does not roll over. If you want it unattended, use the Workflow tool's own loop or `/goal` *inside* the interactive session (see *Running it unattended*).
- **`scripts/orchestrate.py` never calls `claude`.** It is pure deterministic bookkeeping (parse issues → dependency graph → waves; fold verdicts → report). Code computes; sub-agents judge; nothing shells out to Claude.

## What it consumes — the contract

`orchestrate` is the last stage of a pipeline, not a standalone. Upstream, `grill-with-docs` sharpens the plan, `to-issues` cuts it into vertical-slice issues (each marked HITL or AFK, with checkbox acceptance criteria and a `Blocked by` section), and `triage` moves each issue to a terminal state and writes its brief. This skill reads that output:

- **Scope defaults to the `ready-for-agent` issues** — triage's "fully specified, ready for an AFK agent" state (the real label string may be mapped per project). It **excludes `ready-for-human`**: those need human implementation by definition and are never built autonomously.
- **The agent brief is the per-issue contract when one exists.** When an issue reaches `ready-for-agent`, triage posts a durable agent brief (behavioral, no file paths, with testable acceptance criteria and explicit out-of-scope). If an Agent Brief comment exists it is authoritative and the issue body is context; **otherwise the issue body and its acceptance criteria are the contract**, so an issue whose brief was never posted is still built without error. The plan flags each in-scope issue that has no brief.
- **The acceptance criteria and `Blocked by` are machine-read** by `orchestrate.py plan` to build the graph — so the serialization constraint is computed, not guessed.

When the project carries no such pipeline, fall back to whatever `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` defines as its autonomous-agent contract, and resolve scope from the argument.

## Arguments

- `[scope]` — which issues to take on: a label (`--label=…`), a milestone (`--milestone=…`), an explicit list (`#42,#43,#48`), or nothing. With no scope, default to the open `ready-for-agent` issues. Resolve scope **without asking** (see the operating contract); if it genuinely cannot be resolved, stop with a one-line report rather than pausing mid-run.
- `--level=XS|S|M|L|XL` — the single **ambition dial**, default `M`, and the one knob for "how hard to try". It carries **both** halves of ambition (ADR-0001 §1): the per-role `(model, effort)` every sub-agent gets **and** the verification-rigor baseline — the verifier panel size and the fix-round cap. The orchestrator derives each from the level — model/effort per role against the harness's live model list (see *Model and effort*), rigor per ADR-0001 §5 — sliding from a quick, cheap, single-lens posture at `XS` to a strongest-tier, multi-lens posture at `XL`. There are no separate model-floor/ceiling or rigor knobs; they all fold into this one dial. Omit it (or omit the resolution entirely, as an older plan does) and every agent simply inherits the session model at the lean baseline rigor.
- `--merge` — grant **merge authority** for this run, integrating finished issues into the default branch automatically. Merge authority comes from exactly two sources — this per-run `--merge`, **or** a once-per-project (or global) merge policy — and nothing else grants it (`--yes` does not). The **plugin default is PR**: with neither `--merge` nor a merge-granting policy, the run opens one pull request per issue and leaves the merge to you. Where the project policy already makes merge the default, `--yes` alone walks straight to the default branch. The operating contract says where that project policy is recorded and read.
- `--pr` — the explicit **conservative partner** of `--merge` (ADR-0003 §6): force PR mode for this one run, overriding a merge-granting policy without changing the policy itself. Precedence is **explicit flag (`--pr`/`--merge`) > declared policy marker > the conservative PR default**. Supplying **both** `--pr` and `--merge` in the same run is an **error** — a contradiction should be loud, not silently resolved, never guessed past. Merge authority is **never inferred**: `--pr` only ever narrows to PR, exactly as `--merge` only ever grants merge, and no heuristic on its own ever grants it.
- `--max-fix-rounds=N` — **override** the level-derived fix↔verify cap (1 at `XS`/`S`/`M`, 2 at `L`/`XL`; a genuinely high-risk issue can escalate its own cap on top). It is the **only** way to reach `0` rounds — a scan/triage run — since no level defaults to zero (ADR-0001 §5, the fix-round floor is 1). After the cap, the issue is parked in the report rather than looping.
- `--max-lenses=N` — **override** the level-derived per-issue verifier-panel size (1 lens at `XS`/`S`/`M`, 2 at `L`, 3 at `XL`; a risk-escalated issue can raise its own panel further), mirroring `--max-fix-rounds` exactly: a **per-run** override only, never a policy default. `N ≥ 1` is a plain, floor-respecting cap; `N = 0` is the **only** route to a zero panel — it skips the per-issue independent verify stage **entirely**: the implementer still works **test-first** and demonstrates **red-before-green** on its own, but that demonstration becomes self-attested — independent re-checking of it (what an active lens's brief does at `N ≥ 1`) is exactly what `N = 0` drops. The **mandatory integration review** still holds regardless (ADR-0003 §2; see *Rigor baseline* below for the risk precedence under `N = 0`).
- `--plan` / `--dry-run` — produce the plan (scope, dependency graph, waves, merge-or-PR decision) and stop, so you can review before the real run.
- `--yes` — **yes to the single pre-run confirmation gate, and nothing more.** It waives only the go/no-go; it does **not** grant merge authority and does **not** decide merge-vs-PR (that is settled before the gate by `--merge` or the project policy — see the operating contract). `--yes` alone still opens pull requests unless merge authority was granted separately.
- **The budget cap** — the one **orthogonal** knob, a resource bound rather than a quality posture (ADR-0001 §1), so it lives outside `--level`. It is the engine's `budgetFloor` (an `args` knob, default 60000 tokens — see step 4) measured against the run's own token budget (`budget.total`, the session's token target): the engine stops opening new work once the remaining budget falls below the floor, does as much as the budget allows, and reports the remainder — so full-auto is never truly unbounded. It is the **cost cap** surfaced at the single gate, and it is **required** for any run above ~10 issues (see *Cost and chunking*).

## The operating contract

If the project defines its own autonomous-agent and reporting model, follow it. Otherwise this contract binds the orchestrator and every sub-agent:

- **Never block on the maintainer.** No sub-agent stops to ask for input, to have a test run for it, or to wait on a decision — and neither does the orchestrator. This is a hard rule: the run was started so the maintainer could walk away. Genuine ambiguity is resolved by the most reasonable assumption, recorded and reported — never a silent guess, never a pause.
- **The one exception is a true design blocker** — work that cannot proceed without contradicting a settled decision (an ADR, a design doc, a load-bearing invariant). Triage should already have routed most of these to `ready-for-human`; this is the safety net for what it missed. The sub-agent neither guesses past the decision nor waits: it parks that one unit, records the blocker, and continues with everything else.
- **Every sub-agent reports in three buckets** to its caller: *Automatically tested* (what, at which layer), *Remaining for a human* (the irreducibly subjective checks automation cannot meaningfully make), and *Assumptions & blockers*.
- **No sub-agent closes the issue, pushes, or merges.** Those are the orchestrator's and the integrate step's actions alone; the issue is closed only after independent verification, never by a sub-agent — a prohibition the engine hard-codes into every implement, fix, and verify prompt.
- **`--yes` is not merge authority.** `--yes` means *yes to the single pre-run confirmation gate, and nothing more* (ADR-0001 §7): it waives the go/no-go and grants no authority to write to the default branch. Merge-vs-PR is a **policy decided before the gate**, not something `--yes` toggles. Merge authority comes from exactly two sources — the per-run `--merge`, **or** a once-per-project (or global) merge policy — and absent both the **plugin default is PR**, so the run opens one pull request per issue and `--yes` alone walks away to per-issue PRs, never to `main`.
- **Where the merge policy is recorded and read.** The once-per-project policy is an `orchestrate: merge-policy: merge|pr` marker in the project's own agent config — a line in the repo's `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` (a repo-local override), with the maintainer's global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` marker as the once-per-maintainer fallback a repo-local marker overrides. The orchestrator reads it **at plan time**, in step 1 (*Profile and gather* — the same pass that reads the standard and the ADRs), and surfaces the resulting merge-vs-PR decision at the single gate. It is documentation the orchestrator reads as prose, not a deterministic `orchestrate.py` code path; a missing or unrecognised marker means the conservative PR default.
- **The inviolable safety floor** (ADR-0001 §7) holds even under `--yes --merge`, and no assumption, policy, or level may lower it:
    - **Never force-push.** A push that would require force is refused and reported, never forced.
    - **Never merge to the default branch without merge authority** (`--merge` or policy); PR mode merges nothing.
    - **Close an issue only after independent verification *and* integration**, each confirmed individually via `gh issue view`; PR mode leaves issues open.
    - **The rigor floor and the budget bound are always on** — at least one independent adversarial lens plus the mandatory integration review per §5, and the run's token budget (`budgetFloor` + the session target), so full-auto is never truly unbounded.
    - **Never override an ADR or design blocker** — park that unit and report it.
    - **Never bump, tag, or release** — that is the `release` skill.
    - **The run's scaffolding-branch prune is confined to `worktree-<runId>-*`**, and is skipped entirely if `runId` is unresolved — never a loose glob, never another run's branches (the full guarantee is in §Finalize).

## The decision-boundary map

Almost every decision this run makes is **silent** — resolved autonomously from the defaults (role → model/effort; level → rigor; risk → escalation), recorded and reported, never a pause. Only **three** surface at the single confirmation gate: **merge authority**, the **cost cap**, and the **go/no-go**. The one optional per-issue human input is the `Risk:` marker in an issue's Agent Brief or body — an escalate-only lever, **never required**. This table follows ADR-0001 §8 (with the implementation-plan-granularity row folded in from ADR-0002 §3); the sections it points at hold the detail.

| Decision | Who decides | External lever |
| -------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Scope | Silent (default `ready-for-agent`, excluding `ready-for-human`) | the `[scope]` argument |
| Model/effort per role | Silent (derived from `--level`) | `--level` |
| Rigor baseline (panel size, fix-round cap) | Silent (derived from `--level`) | `--level` |
| Per-issue risk → rigor escalation | Silent (inferred at plan time, escalate-only) | the `Risk:` marker / a `risk:*` label |
| Which lenses a verifier spends | Silent (level + risk, planner-tailored) | indirect (via `--level` and risk) |
| Per-issue lens-panel cap | Silent (level+risk baseline; breachable only via the explicit override) | `--max-lenses` (`=0` is the sole floor-breach, ADR-0003 §2) |
| Implementation-plan granularity | Silent (from `--level`: a recipe at `XS`/`S` … none at `XL`) | `--level` |
| Fix / hotfix rounds | Silent (from `--level`) | `--max-fix-rounds` |
| **Merge vs PR** | **Confirmed at the gate** (shown in the plan) | `--merge` / `--pr` / a project merge policy — merge authority is **never inferred** (ADR-0003 §6) |
| **Cost cap** (required above ~10 issues) | **Confirmed at the gate** | the budget cap (`budgetFloor` + the session token target) |
| **Whether to run** | **Confirmed at the gate** | `--yes` waives it |
| Push a feature branch / the default branch | Silent (the default branch only under merge authority) | merge authority |
| Close an issue | Silent (only after verify + integrate) | floor, not overridable |
| Escalate a risky issue | Silent (never silently downgraded) | the `Risk:` marker raises the floor |
| A true design blocker | Silent — park + report, never override an ADR | floor |
| Scaffolding-branch prune | Silent (run-scoped to `worktree-<runId>-*`) | floor |
| Bump / tag / release | **Never** — out of scope | the `release` skill |

## Flow

### 1. Profile and gather

Read the project's `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` and the `docs/` they point at — the coding standard, the definition of done, the test strategy, and the ADRs or design docs the issues reference. Resolve the scope (default: `ready-for-agent`, excluding `ready-for-human`), then read every in-scope issue **and its agent brief** with `gh issue view <n> --comments`.

Sub-agents cannot invoke skills, so the standard and the test discipline must reach them **as files they can read** (the `skill-by-reference` pattern). If the project has no `agents.d/coding-standard/` directory, run `/coding-standard` once to scaffold it before dispatching; the sub-agents then read `general.md` plus the module(s) for the language or framework they touch.

### 2. Plan (deterministic)

Hand the issues to the helper rather than reasoning out the graph by hand:

```bash
gh issue list --label ready-for-agent --state open \
    --json number,title,labels,body,comments --limit 200 \
  | uv run "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/orchestrate.py" plan \
        --exclude-label ready-for-human
```

It returns the dependency graph, the topologically ordered **waves** (issues in one wave are independent and may run concurrently), any dependency that points outside the scope, and the issues it excluded. A dependency cycle is a hard error it reports rather than guessing past. With `--plan`, present this and stop.

Fetch `comments` (as above) so brief detection is real: the plan flags each in-scope issue that carries no Agent Brief comment — a per-issue `no_brief` boolean and a convenience top-level `issues_without_brief` list. Those issues are **still built**, from their body and acceptance criteria; the flag is visibility, not exclusion, and the engine falls back cleanly when no brief was posted.

The plan also carries a `merge_required` flag (with a human-readable `merge_note`): it is `true` whenever the in-scope graph has any cross-issue edge. Treat it as the cue for the merge-vs-PR decision below — when it is `true`, set the engine's `merge` arg (step 4) so dependents build on a base that already contains their prerequisites, rather than branching off bare `main`. The conservative one-PR-per-issue default is safe only when `merge_required` is `false`. This is now **enforced**, not merely advised: in PR mode the engine merges nothing, so a prerequisite that only opened a pull request is not on any dependent's base — the engine therefore **parks** each dependent that has an in-scope prerequisite (with a reason that names it and points at `--merge`) instead of building it on an incomplete base, and the skip cascades transitively. So a dependency chain launched in PR mode parks its dependents by design; run it under `--merge` (or after the prerequisites' PRs merge) to build the whole chain.

The plan also carries the run's **verification rigor**, derived deterministically from the `--level` dial (which `plan` accepts, default `M`) and each issue's explicit risk. Each `issues[]` entry gains a `lenses` array — its verifier panel, 1 broad lens at `XS`/`S`/`M`, 2 at `L`, 3 at `XL`, escalated per issue by a `Risk:` marker or `risk:*` label (escalate-only) — and the plan carries the run-level `maxFixRounds` cap (`--max-fix-rounds` overrides it; the only route to `0`). A `Risk: low` marker contradicted by a hazard label is surfaced in the plan's `warnings` rather than silently applied. This is the rigor baseline of *Model and effort*, computed by the helper so the engine applies it unchanged.

### 3. Confirm (single gate)

Show the plan from step 2 — scope, graph, waves, and whether the run will merge or open pull requests — and wait for one confirmation. Per the decision-boundary map above (ADR-0001 §8), exactly three things surface at this single gate — **merge authority, the cost cap, and the go/no-go** — and everything else stays silent. The **merge-vs-PR decision is shown here** but was *settled before* the gate by `--merge` or the project merge policy (see the operating contract); the gate displays it, it does not re-decide it. `--yes`, or a `--plan` you have already reviewed, skips the gate — and it waives **only the go/no-go**, never the merge decision: `--yes` alone still opens pull requests unless merge authority was granted separately. Beyond this gate the run does not stop, with one exception: integrating into the default branch happens only under `--merge` or a merge-granting project policy; otherwise the work lands as pull requests.

#### Cost and chunking

Size the run before you confirm it — present an **agent and token estimate** at the gate, not just a list of issues. The per-issue cost is **level-aware**, because `--level` sets both the verifier **panel size** and the **fix-round cap** (see *Model and effort* → the rigor baseline): write `P` for the level's **panel size** — **1** lens at `XS`/`S`/`M`, **2** at `L`, **3** at `XL` — and `F` for its **fix-round cap** — 1 at `XS`/`S`/`M`, 2 at `L`/`XL` (a genuinely high-risk issue can escalate its own `P`/`F` above the level's). An issue that needs no fix costs `1 implement + P verify + 1 integrate` = `P + 2` **sub-agents**; an issue that exhausts the cap costs `1 implement + P verify + F × (1 fix + 1 targeted re-verify) + 1 integrate` = `P + 2F + 2` — the targeted re-verify after each **fix round** is a real agent the engine always dispatches, so the honest worst case is `P + 2F + 2`, not `P + 2`. Add a once-per-run overhead: **≈ 2** in the default PR mode (the mandatory integration review + the worktree teardown), rising to **≈ 5** in merge mode when a finding drives a hotfix (integration review + hotfix + its land + re-review + teardown; that hotfix loop is itself bounded by `maxIntegrationRounds`, which follows the fix-round cap). A **typical** closed form to compute at the gate — `N` is the issue count, `P` the level's panel size, `F` its fix-round cap:

```text
agents ≈ N × (P + F + 2) + overhead   (typical; per issue P+2 … P+2F+2; overhead ≈2 PR, up to ≈5 merge)
```

At the **default `M` level** (`P = 1`, `F = 1`) this is the lean baseline — a **single broad reviewer** and **one fix round** — so per issue is **3–5 sub-agents** (3 with no fix, 5 when the one fix round and its re-verify run), ≈ 4 on **average**, and the form reduces to `agents ≈ N × 4 + 3`. A **higher level** raises both `P` and `F`, so the per-issue count climbs with ambition: `L` (`P = 2`, `F = 2`) is 4–8 per issue, `XL` (`P = 3`, `F = 2`) is 5–9, and a high-risk issue planning escalated adds its extra `lenses` on top of the level's `P`. Translate to tokens so the reader sees the real cost, not just an agent count: each implement, verify, fix, or re-verify sub-agent spends on the **order of tens of thousands to low hundreds of thousands of tokens** — the judgment lenses at the level's strongest tier, the implementer at its level-derived tier, not every agent on the strong model — so a 30-issue run at `M` — `30 × 4 + 3 ≈ 123` sub-agents — is on the order of millions of tokens, easily enough to hit a monthly cap mid-run.

Because each green issue integrates the moment it is verified (step 4), a stopped run keeps every issue already landed — on the default branch under `--merge`, or as an already-opened per-issue **PR** in the conservative default mode. Exploit that: run a large backlog in **slices of 8–10 issues at a time**, not one unbounded run, so a spend cut-off loses at most the current slice rather than the whole batch — this pairs with the per-issue incremental landing that already makes each green issue durable.

For any run above **~10 issues**, do not pass this gate unbounded: **require an explicit cap** before proceeding. The real levers are `budgetFloor` — an engine `args` knob (default 60000 tokens; see step 4) that stops opening new work once the run's remaining token budget falls below it — the run's own token budget (`budget.total`, set by the session's token target, which `budgetFloor` is measured against), a lower `maxFixRounds`, and **slicing** the batch into fewer issues per run. Set at least one of these and state it in the confirmation. A large run without a cap must not be confirmed; that bound is what the confirm gate exists to enforce for a big batch.

### 4. Build (engine)

**Preferred — the Workflow tool.** Launch `skills/orchestrate/orchestrate.workflow.js` with the plan JSON (plus `merge`, `maxFixRounds`, `maxIntegrationRounds`, `budgetFloor`, the per-role `(model, effort)` resolution `roles` the `--level` dial produced during planning — see *Model and effort* — each issue's level-and-risk-scaled verifier panel `lenses` and its per-issue implementation `plan` (ADR-0002's additive "how" overlay, absent at `XL`), both set during planning, and the run-level `implementerMode` marker the sliding implementer uses — see *Model and effort*) as `args`. `maxIntegrationRounds` is the cap on the mandatory integration review's hotfix loop (step 5), an `args` knob that defaults to `maxFixRounds` (the level's fix-round cap — 1 at `XS`/`S`/`M`, 2 at `L`/`XL`) so the integration stage is bounded exactly as a per-issue fix loop is. `roles` carries the `{ judgment, implementer, mechanical }` tuning the engine spreads into every sub-agent's dispatch (see *Model and effort*); omit it — as an older plan does — and every agent inherits the session model, so a launch that drops it silently reverts the whole run to the session tier. The control flow — wave order, the capped fix↔verify loop, and per-issue serial dispatch that integrates each green issue the moment it is verified (so a mid-run stop leaves every prior issue durably on the default branch) — is code there, so it cannot drift over a long unattended run. It honours wave **outcome**, not just wave order: before building an issue the engine checks that every in-scope prerequisite actually **landed** on the base the dependent builds from, and if one did not it **skips (parks) the dependent with a reason naming the unlanded prerequisite** rather than build it on a base missing that work — and because a skipped issue never lands, the skip **cascades** to its own dependents transitively. A prerequisite counts as landed only when the run put it on that base: in **merge** mode when it integrated, but in the conservative **PR** mode NOTHING merges, so an in-scope prerequisite is only an open pull request and its dependent is parked (the reason points at `--merge`) — the same enforcement `merge_required` warns about, now applied by the engine rather than left to advice. Beyond that, agents run in the subscription pool; worktree isolation keeps concurrent agents apart; the run is budget-bounded — `budgetFloor` (an `args` knob, default 60000 tokens) stops the engine opening new work once the remaining token budget drops below it, the settable cap the confirm gate requires for a large run — and resumable via its `runId`.

**Fallback — the Agent tool.** Where the Workflow tool is unavailable (some Cowork / portable contexts), drive the same lifecycle from this session with the Agent tool, still calling `orchestrate.py` for the plan and the report. Use `/goal` for the outer loop (see below).

Either way the per-issue lifecycle is the same:

1. **Implement.** One implementer sub-agent on its own branch reads the **agent brief** (the contract, or — when no brief was posted — the issue body and its acceptance criteria), the standard, and the level-scaled **implementation plan** the orchestrator authored — ADR-0002's additive "how" overlay, treated per the run's `implementerMode` framing (a recipe to execute at the low end, goals to reason from at the high end; the field is absent at `XL`, so the implementer reasons from the brief alone). The brief stays the authoritative *what* and the tests bind to the acceptance criteria, never to the plan. It implements **test-first** (red/green/refactor) at the layer the test strategy prescribes, **demonstrates the red** (a failing-test commit before the green one), runs the project's gates, reports their real results, and returns the three-bucket report.
2. **Verify, independently.** Only after green, a fresh verifier that did **not** write the code reviews **only what the gates cannot**. The panel size is the level's rigor baseline (see *Model and effort*): at `XS`/`S`/`M` a **single broad adversarial reviewer** whose one lens folds every concern together — correctness against the brief's intent and acceptance criteria, test quality (is the red demonstrated? do the tests bind? does every criterion map to a test?), and any security or data-safety hazard the issue touches; `L` raises it to **2** focused lenses and `XL` to **3**, and a genuinely high-risk issue — a write path, a permission gate, a filesystem boundary, an irreversible delete — escalates its own panel further, up to that 3-lens ceiling (escalate-only, never past it). The per-issue `lenses` array, set during planning, carries this. Use the project's specialized review agents where they exist; diverse lenses catch what identical reviewers miss, but only pay for them where the level and the risk earn them.
3. **Decide.** Read only the verdicts — never the diffs yourself. All clear → integrate. Any real finding → return it to the same implementer to fix, then **re-verify only the fixed findings** with a single targeted reviewer — not the whole panel again — capped at the level's fix-round cap (`--max-fix-rounds` overrides it; 1 at `XS`/`S`/`M`, 2 at `L`/`XL`); if it still fails, park that issue and continue.
4. **Integrate, immediately.** Land each green issue the moment it is verified, before the next issue's work begins, in dependency order. Keep history linear: fast-forward the *default* branch to the feature branch's tip (`git merge --ff-only <feature>` from the default branch) — never merge the default branch into the feature branch, never create a merge commit there. Crucially, the feature branch is still checked out in its implementer's (or fix round's) persisted worktree, and git refuses one branch in two worktrees at once, so integrate advances the default *without ever checking out the feature branch*; with the serial integrate-immediately design the feature branch is already a fast-forward ahead of the default, so no rebase replay is needed. Landing per-issue makes partial progress durable: a stop between issues leaves every already-integrated issue on the default branch. Under the conservative default, open a pull request instead and leave the merge to the maintainer.

### 5. Finalize

Re-run the full gate suite over the merged whole — green on each issue does not guarantee green on the union. Then the engine runs a **mandatory** adversarial integration review over the real combined change set of the run: one reviewer given a per-issue verifier's full rigor (never a token smoke test), hunting the cross-issue defects no per-issue lens can see — one issue's change silently weakening another's guarantee, a contradiction between two changes, a broken invariant across their union. It **always runs** whenever the run integrated at least one issue, and it is **mode-aware**: in merge mode it reviews the combined diff now on the default branch; in the conservative PR mode nothing landed on the default branch, so it reviews the **union of the run's feature branches** against the default branch (reviewing the default branch there would see nothing and falsely clear). Its clear decision goes through the same block-unless-explicitly-cleared rule a per-issue verdict does. In **merge mode** it can **fix, not merely report**: a real finding drives a **bounded hotfix + re-review** — a code-touching agent on its own worktree creates a fresh hotfix branch off the up-to-date default branch, addresses only those findings, lands through the same linear fast-forward step, and the combined diff is re-reviewed — capped by `maxIntegrationRounds` (an engine `args` knob defaulting to `maxFixRounds`, i.e. 1), like a per-issue fix loop. In **PR mode** the review still always runs, but a finding is **reported (parked with its specifics) for the human** rather than auto-hotfixed, matching the leave-the-merge-to-you posture. A finding is never silently cleared or dropped in either mode. Then fold the run's records into one report. The engine returns `{ verdicts, parked, integration }`, but `report` consumes a **single flat JSON array** that it partitions by each record's `status`, so its input is the **concatenation of `verdicts` and `parked`**, not `verdicts` alone — piping only the field literally named `verdicts` would silently drop every parked or blocked issue, and the parked integration-review finding, from the final report:

```bash
uv run "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/orchestrate.py" report < verdicts.json
```

Here `verdicts.json` is that concatenated `verdicts` + `parked` array. Surface the `integration` review outcome too: when it **cleared**, that positive fact lives only in the returned `integration` field and the engine log, so state it explicitly in what you report; when it did not clear, its finding is already parked (and thus already in the concatenated array), so it renders under the parked issues — do not drop it either way. It leads with what is done and green, then the de-duplicated *Remaining for a human* list, then *Assumptions* and the parked or blocked issues. Do not bump the version, tag, or publish — when the merged work is ready to ship, that is the `release` skill.

#### Confirming closures

The orchestrator closes each verified-and-integrated issue itself (never a sub-agent), and confirms each close **individually**: verify a closure by querying that issue's own state with `gh issue view <n>` (read its `state` / `closed` field), and count the issue as closed only when its own record says so.

Do not confirm closures by re-running `gh issue list` — GitHub's issue-list endpoint is eventually consistent and reads **stale** immediately after a close, so a just-closed issue can still show as open in the list even though its own `gh issue view` already reports it closed; the report/closing step counts a close only against that individual `gh issue view <n>` state, never against the list re-query.

#### Pruning the run's scaffolding branches

Leave the repository state-neutral: prune this run's own leftover worktree scaffolding branches as the last finalize act. The Workflow harness names each per-worktree scaffolding branch `worktree-<runId>-<n>`, and once an agent checks out its own feature branch that ref is orphaned — #14's teardown removes the worktrees and preserves every feature-branch ref, but leaves these now-orphaned scaffolding branches behind to accumulate across runs. Because they are order-independent of the report and the closures (nothing there reads a branch ref), pruning them fits equally before or after those steps; do it once the engine has returned and the worktrees are already torn down. You know the run's `runId` from the Workflow launch, so delete **only** the branches matching this run's own `worktree-<runId>-*` prefix — `git branch --list "worktree-<runId>-*"` to list them, then `git branch -D` each. Belt-and-braces before you build that glob: verify the `runId` you captured from the launch is non-empty and substitutes into the pattern verbatim — an empty or partial value degenerates `worktree-<runId>-*` into `worktree--*` or a bare `worktree-*` that matches **every** run's scaffolding, including a concurrent same-repo run's, so if the `runId` is missing or unresolved, **skip the prune entirely** rather than run a delete on a loose glob (this force-delete's confinement holds only while the substituted prefix is genuinely run-scoped). Confine the match to the exact `runId`: **never** delete a feature branch, an integration-hotfix branch, or any branch outside that run-scoped prefix, and never touch another run's scaffolding. This is the one authorised branch delete the orchestrator makes — the sub-agents and the worktree teardown are forbidden any — and it changes nothing about #14's worktree teardown or its preservation of every feature-branch ref.

## Model and effort

Model and reasoning effort are not set per agent by hand — they are **derived from the `--level` dial**. The **orchestrator** (the session-model planning pass) turns the level into a **per-role `(model, effort)`** and hands it to the engine as `args.roles`; the engine stores no model-name table and only applies what it is given (spreading it into each sub-agent's dispatch), so a role that carries no resolution — or an older plan with no `roles` at all — simply inherits the session model. Put the strong model and the high effort where the judgement is, not where the routing is — and let the level decide how strong.

**Three role classes carry the tuning**, with the hierarchy `reviewer ≥ implementer ≥ mechanical`:

- **Judgment** — the one-time planning judgement and the **adversarial verifier**: the single broad reviewer that runs by default, the extra lenses a high-risk issue adds, and the mandatory integration review. The strongest tier the level allows — this is where real bugs are caught.
- **Implementer** — the code-writing agents (implement, its fix round, the integration hotfix). Its model **slides with the level**, and so does its *mode* (ADR-0002): at the low end it is a cheap executor of a detailed, pre-settled plan; at `L`/`XL` it rises to meet the reviewer and reasons out the "how" itself, because there it is the primary thinker. The irreducible thinking migrates from the plan to the implementer as the level climbs — see *The sliding implementer and the implementation-planning pass* below.
- **Mechanical leaves** — integrate and the worktree teardown. The cheapest tier; they gain nothing from a stronger model.

**The mapping is derived at runtime, not hardcoded.** What is fixed is the set of levels and their semantic intent per role; the concrete `(model, effort)` is resolved by the orchestrator **against the harness's live model list** at plan time, so it self-updates as models change (a new Opus, Fable's successor) with no literal model-name table stored as the durable contract. The ladder below is what that derivation produces *today* — an **illustrative, non-durable** instantiation (as of 2026-07), refreshed as models change, never a promise:

| Level | Judgment (planning + review) | Implementer | Mechanical |
| ----- | ---------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| **XS** | Sonnet · high | Haiku · thinking | Haiku · thinking |
| **S** | Sonnet · xhigh | Sonnet · high | Haiku · thinking |
| **M** | Opus · high | Sonnet · xhigh | Sonnet · high |
| **L** | Opus · xhigh | Opus · xhigh | Sonnet · high |
| **XL** | Fable · xhigh | Fable · xhigh | Sonnet · high |

Effort maps to the harness ladder `low < medium < high < xhigh < max`; the ladder's `thinking` (the XS/S mechanical and low-end implementer tiers) is **not** a rung on that scale but shorthand for **Haiku with light extended thinking** (ADR-0001 §4), so it does not contradict the effort scale above. Two **guardrails** bound this runtime derivation:

- **Only dispatchable models.** The resolution may pick only a model the harness can actually **dispatch**; an intent that would land on an unavailable model falls back to the nearest available tier rather than failing the run.
- **Judgment never below the session tier.** The judgment roles (planning + the adversarial reviewer) never resolve *below* the session model's tier — the reviewer is the last line of defence and is not silently cheapened — **unless** the maintainer explicitly dialed down with a low `--level`.

### Rigor baseline (from the same dial)

The `--level` dial carries **both** halves of ambition (ADR-0001 §1): alongside the per-role `(model, effort)` above, it sets the **verification-rigor baseline** — how many independent verifier lenses each issue gets, and how many fix rounds the loop may take. Unlike the model/effort ladder, these are **fixed, model-agnostic integers** (ADR-0001 §5), derived deterministically by `orchestrate.py plan` (not resolved against any live list), so they are durable, not illustrative:

| Level | Verifier lenses (per issue) | Fix rounds |
| ----- | --------------------------- | ---------- |
| **XS** | 1 broad (correctness + tests + security, folded) | 1 |
| **S** | 1 broad | 1 |
| **M** | 1 broad | 1 |
| **L** | 2 focused (correctness+tests · security) | 2 |
| **XL** | 3 focused (correctness · tests · security) | 2 |

A **lens** is one independent verifier sub-agent with a review focus; the mandatory integration review (step 5) always runs on top, whatever the level. Two adjustments ride on the baseline, both settled at plan time:

- **Per-issue risk escalates, escalate-only** (ADR-0001 §6). An explicit `Risk: high | medium | low` marker in the issue's Agent Brief or body — or an optional `risk:*` label — is read deterministically, and the rigor rank is the **highest** of the level baseline and the risk signal, so a `Risk: high` on an otherwise-`XS` issue pulls just that issue up to the `XL` tier. Risk never pulls rigor *below* the level baseline, and an explicit `Risk: low` contradicted by a hazard label is **not** silently applied — the hazard still escalates and the disagreement is reported (a plan `warnings` entry).
- **The inviolable floor holds under everything** (ADR-0001 §5, §7, as amended by ADR-0003 §2), even at `XS`, even under `--yes`: at least **1** adversarial lens per issue, a fix-round floor of **1** (an issue is always repaired at least once rather than parked for a human), and the mandatory integration review whenever ≥ 1 issue integrated. The **per-issue-lens floor is breachable only by an explicit `--max-lenses=0`** — never by a level, a policy, or `--yes` — and even then the **mandatory integration review** still holds; the implementer still works test-first and demonstrates red-before-green on its own, but at `N = 0` that demonstration is self-attested only — independent re-checking of it is exactly what the breach drops, along with the rest of the panel; likewise `0` fix rounds is reachable **only** via an explicit `--max-fix-rounds=0` for a scan/triage run.
- **Risk precedence under `--max-lenses=0`** (ADR-0003 §5): the flag holds by default and yields only through two narrow channels, split by *when* the hazard is discovered. A **plan-time hazard** — the planner infers one from the brief, or an explicit `Risk:`/`risk:*` signal — is surfaced at the single confirm gate and in the plan's `warnings`; the flag still holds unless you override it there, and `--yes` waives only the go/no-go (its precise, gate-only meaning — never a blanket waiver of this scrutiny). An **in-situ hazard** — the implementer discovers, during the work, a genuine, previously-unseen danger surface (a write path, a permission gate, an irreversible delete) and flags it in its three-bucket report — escalates automatically to **one** verifier lens on that one issue, the sole sanctioned automatic override. Either way there is **no mid-run pause**: risk surfaces only at the gate (plan-time) or as the one-lens escalation (in-situ), never as a blocking per-issue prompt.
- **The `--max-lenses=0` use-case, and the non-use-case** (ADR-0003 §3): it earns its place at **batch scale** — a large (≈10–30), homogeneous-trivial batch of individually-trivial issues (a bulk rename, a batch of docstrings, a mechanical migration) where an independent per-issue second opinion is N× overhead for near-zero risk, and the integration review plus your own review suffice; the saving scales with the batch size. It is **not** for a small trivial task: two dependent trivial functions reach for a **lighter tool** (a single `tdd`/`coder` agent, or `--level=XS`), not `orchestrate --max-lenses=0` — that reaches for the wrong tool while also turning off its own safety net.

### The sliding implementer and the implementation-planning pass (ADR-0002)

The implementer's *mode* slides with the level because the orchestrator hands it a level-scaled plan. As an extension of the one-time planning judgment — the same pass that reads each brief to set the issue's risk and its verifier panel, **not** a new engine sub-agent, so it costs **zero** extra agents per issue — the orchestrator authors a per-issue **implementation plan** whose detail scales *inversely* with the level:

| Level | Plan the orchestrator authors | Framing the engine applies |
| ----- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **XS / S** | Recipe / decomposition — ordered steps, which tests to write first, the tricky parts spelled out | `execute` |
| **M** | Balanced spec — what to build, how the criteria map to tests, the non-obvious decisions called out | `balanced` |
| **L** | Goals + constraints + risks — the objective and invariants, minimal "how" | `autonomous` |
| **XL** | No plan — the field is omitted; the implementer reasons from the brief | `autonomous` |

The plan is an **additive "how" overlay** — the Agent Brief (or the issue body) stays the authoritative *what*, and the tests bind to the acceptance criteria, never to the plan. The engine consumes two fields the orchestrator sets: a per-issue `issues[].plan` string (absent at `XL` or in any pre-plan run) and a run-level `implementerMode ∈ { execute, balanced, autonomous }` marker (`XS`/`S` → `execute` · `M` → `balanced` · `L`/`XL` → `autonomous`). The marker — explicit, never inferred from whether a plan string is present — selects one of three fixed engine framings that tell the `implement` agent how to *treat* the plan: **execute** a settled recipe test-first without re-deriving it, **balanced** fill in the routine "how" yourself, or **autonomous** reason out the "how" from the goals (or, at `XL`, the brief) with the tests as your guide. The plan and framing apply to `implement` **only**; `fix` is finding-driven and `integrationHotfix` is cross-issue, so both keep their prompts unchanged. Both fields degrade cleanly: absent either one, `implement` behaves exactly as before.

The spine itself stays **code, not an LLM**, so there is no expensive "orchestrator LLM" doing routing: the deterministic work — is the graph acyclic (`orchestrate.py plan`), did the gates exit green — belongs to the helper and the gate run (CPU, not tokens), never to a sub-agent reading text by eye. Whether the red was genuinely demonstrated before the green, and whether each criterion maps to a test, are today judgement calls the verifier sub-agent makes reading the branch's history and diff (at `N ≥ 1`); `orchestrate.py redgreen` can make the red-before-green half of that call deterministically from a git log, but nothing in the per-issue lifecycle invokes it yet, so at `--max-lenses=0` — where no verifier runs at all — that demonstration is self-attested only. The orchestrator only reads verdicts and routes; the judgement lives in the verifier and implementer sub-agents, and that — scaled by the level — is where the tier and the effort go.

## Running it unattended (`/goal`)

In the fallback (no Workflow tool), the cleanest "keep going until done" driver is `/goal`, combined with auto mode — `/goal` removes the per-turn prompt, auto mode the per-tool prompt:

```text
/goal every open ready-for-agent issue is closed with its PR merged, and the
full test + lint + build suite exits 0 over the integrated default branch; or
stop after 30 turns. Resolve ambiguity by assumption and never ask me.
```

Two cautions. Run `/goal` **interactively** — `claude -p "/goal …"` is headless and burns the credit pool. And `/goal`'s evaluator is a small model reading the transcript; it does **not** run your gates, so trust the **deterministic gate re-run in step 5** as the real proof of done, not the evaluator's say-so. With the Workflow tool, you do not need `/goal` at all — the workflow loops internally and returns once.

## What this skill does not do

- **No release.** No version bump, tag, or platform release — hand the merged work to `release`.
- **No design decisions.** It never resolves a true design blocker by overriding an ADR or design doc; it records the blocker and moves on.
- **No code by its own hand.** The orchestrator plans, dispatches, judges verdicts, and integrates; the sub-agents write and verify the code.
- **No `claude -p`.** No script in this skill invokes Claude headlessly; all agent work runs in the interactive session (see *Cost model*).

## Relationship to the other skills

- **`coder`** is the standard the sub-agents code to. They cannot invoke it, so they read the project's checked-in `agents.d/coding-standard/` modules (scaffolded by `/coding-standard`); when that directory is absent, the orchestrator runs `/coding-standard` once to produce it before dispatching.
- **`tdd`** is the implementer's discipline — its test-first, vertical-slice, behavior-over-implementation rules. Reach it the same way: as a file the sub-agent reads, since it cannot invoke the skill. Its planning step is human-gated, so the **agent brief** stands in for the maintainer's approval.
- **`to-issues` / `triage`** are upstream: they produce the `ready-for-agent` issues, the `Blocked by` graph, and the agent briefs this skill consumes.
- **`push` / `release`** take over at the end. `orchestrate` stops at integrated, verified, green code; `push` saves in-progress work, and `release` ships a version.

## Files this skill uses

- `scripts/orchestrate.py` — deterministic helper: `plan` (issues JSON → dependency graph + waves), `redgreen` (git-log → red-before-green verdict), and `report` (verdicts JSON → consolidated report). Never calls `claude`; covered by `tests/test_orchestrate.py`.
- `skills/orchestrate/orchestrate.workflow.js` — the Workflow-tool engine: implement → verify → integrate over the planned waves, agents in the subscription pool. A workflow script must have **exactly one top-level `export` (`export const meta`) and no other top-level `export` or `import`** — the Workflow harness rejects any additional top-level `export`/`import` with a `SyntaxError` at launch, so any helper that needs its own unit test is kept inline here and mirrored in an importable module (`lib/orchestrate/engine-helpers.mjs`) that the tests exercise.
- Reads (per project): `agents.d/coding-standard/` (the scaffolded standard), the issues' agent briefs, the definition of done, the test strategy, and the cited ADRs / design docs.
