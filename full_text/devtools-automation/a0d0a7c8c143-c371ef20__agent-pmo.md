description: Apply portfolio-wide repository standards (Makefile, CI, linting, coverage) to a new or existing repo.

> **Portable skill.** This skill adapts to the current repository. The agent MUST inspect the repo structure and use judgment to apply these instructions appropriately.

# Enforce Repository Standards

This skill is a **process wrapper around the spec**. The spec is authoritative for every rule, table, config file, command, and threshold. This file tells you the order of operations, what to inspect in the target repo, and what decisions to make. **Do not duplicate spec content here — point to the relevant spec ID and read it.**

- **Spec:** `{{STANDARDS_REPO}}/docs/specs/REPO-STANDARDS-SPEC.md`
- **Templates:** `{{STANDARDS_REPO}}/agent-pmo-skill/templates/`

If the paths above do not exist, report an error and stop. Do not search the filesystem or guess paths.

**NEVER run `git commit`, `git push`, or any git write command.** Read-only git commands (status, log, diff) are fine.

## How to use this skill

1. Read the spec. When a step references a spec ID (e.g. `[MAKE-TARGETS]`), open that section and follow it. The spec contains the rules; this file is the workflow.
2. Before touching files, read the universal rules below — they apply to every step.
3. Execute Steps 1–5 in order.

## Universal rules (apply to EVERY step)

- **Token discipline.** Try to be economical with token usage while carrying out this skill.
- **Merge, don't clobber.** If a compliant equivalent exists → leave it. If an equivalent exists under a wrong name → rename/update in place. Only create from scratch if nothing equivalent exists.
- **No duplicates.** The target repo must not end up with two files serving the same purpose. Rename or delete the old one.
- **Templates are starting points, not copy-paste targets.** See spec [MODES-CUSTOMIZE]. Strip every language/tool section that does not apply. Fill every `{{placeholder}}`. Zero irrelevant content in the output.
- **Stamp every file you create or substantively modify** with `agent-pmo:<hash>` per spec [MARKER] / [MARKER-FORMAT]. Get the hash with `git -C "{{STANDARDS_REPO}}" rev-parse --short HEAD`.
- **Never stamp a file whose source does not exist in `{{STANDARDS_REPO}}/agent-pmo-skill/templates/`.** Verify by reading the source first. Applies especially to skills — list `templates/skills/` and only create what is actually there.
- **Never run git write commands.** Read-only git is fine.
- **Release tags build immutable source.** For tag-triggered releases, build the tagged SHA. Do not
  check out `main`, commit/push version bumps, or move tags/branches during release. See
  [CI-RELEASE].
- **Version stamping is a build input.** Deployable repos SHOULD keep source versions at
  `0.0.0-dev` and stamp the tag/test version via a first-class script or build target before build,
  verify, package, and publish. Do not use ad hoc `sed` against structured files.
- **Developer-tool repos MUST run the shipwright-compliance skill.** It is authoritative for VSIX
  bundling, manifest, version stamping, and publishing. See [CI-SHIPWRIGHT].

## Instructions

### Step 1 — Read the spec and detect context

1. Read `{{STANDARDS_REPO}}/docs/specs/REPO-STANDARDS-SPEC.md`. All file contents, configs, CI workflows, and commands come from the spec. Do not improvise.
2. Detect languages from build files (`Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `pubspec.yaml`, `*.csproj`/`*.fsproj`/`*.sln`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`).
3. Determine repo type (library, CLI, app/service, extension, static site) for the coverage threshold per spec [COVERAGE-THRESHOLDS]. Default 90%. **If the repo ships a developer tool** (VS Code `.vsix`, CLI/binary published to Homebrew/Scoop/npm/NuGet/PyPI/crates.io, IDE plugin, installer), flag it for the mandatory Shipwright audit in Step 3c per spec [CI-SHIPWRIGHT].
4. **Identify the canonical instruction file** per spec [AGENT-CANONICAL] and [AGENT-PLACEMENT]:
   - `AGENTS.md` with substantial content (>10 lines, not a pointer) → canonical.
   - Else `CLAUDE.md` with substantial content → canonical.
   - Else (uninitiated repo) create the generic `AGENTS.md` from `templates/AGENTS.md` as canonical — for EVERY agent, Claude included ([DESIGN] 5a). Other agent files (`CLAUDE.md` via `@AGENTS.md`, etc.) become pointers per [AGENT-POINTERS]. Prefer generic over Claude-specific, but never break Claude.
5. Read the target agent's official docs (spec [AGENT-DOCS]) before touching instruction/skill files. Syntax and placement differ per agent.

### Step 2 — Audit existing artifacts

Before creating anything, **inventory what already exists** so Step 3 can merge instead of duplicate.

For each area below, record: what exists, what's missing, what's under a wrong name, what duplicates a standard artifact.

- **2a. Docs folder.** Look for `docs/` (standard) or variants `doco/`, `documentation/`, `doc/`, `documents/`. Check for `docs/specs/` and `docs/plans/` subdirs. Flag loose markdown files in `docs/` for classification.
- **2b. CI workflows.** List `.github/workflows/*.yml`. Identify any existing workflow that does what `ci.yml`/`release.yml`/`deploy-pages.yml` should do, under any filename. Per spec [CI-WORKFLOWS] / [CI-JOBS] these will be renamed in Step 3, not re-created.
  Also note whether `.github/workflows/dependabot-automerge.yml` exists and whether the `dependabot-upgrades` staging branch exists (`git ls-remote --heads origin dependabot-upgrades`) — both are required by [GITHUB-DEPENDABOT], created in Step 3g-dep if missing.
  Flag these trigger violations per [CI-WORKFLOWS]:
  - `ci.yml` triggering on `push: branches: [main]` (merges to main must trigger nothing — PR-only, unless the repo allows non-PR commits to main, which must be commented).
  - `ci.yml` or `codeql.yml` triggering on `branches: [dependabot-upgrades]` (breaks the no-CI-on-staging guarantee — staging PRs must run zero CI; [GITHUB-DEPENDABOT]).
  - `release.yml` triggering on anything other than a `v*` tag push (no release on merge/schedule).
  - A repo that HAS a website but whose `release.yml` has no website-deploy step (release MUST deploy the site).
  For release workflows, also flag these as critical blockers: checkout `ref: main` in tag jobs, any
  `git commit`/`git push`/tag mutation, source-control version bumps after the tag, ad hoc `sed`
  stamping of structured files, missing tests for build-time version stamping, and — for any repo with
  a `codeql.yml` — a `release.yml` whose publish jobs do NOT `needs:` a gated CodeQL job (a release that
  cannot be stopped by a security finding is a critical blocker, see [GITHUB-CODE-SCANNING]).
- **2c. Makefile.** If present, read in full. Classify every public target per spec [MAKE-TARGETS]:
  - (i) A standard target that applies to this repo → note whether present/missing/wrongly-implemented. Do NOT flag an absent standard target as missing if it has nothing to do here (no `build` on a docs-only repo) — only the targets that apply are required.
  - (ii) Duplicates/shadows a standard target under a synonym (e.g. `test-all`, `lint-fix`, `build-release`) → candidate for merge+delete.
  - (iii) Agent-pmo-stamped but source no longer in standards repo → orphan per [MARKER-CLEANUP].
  - (iv) Genuine repo-specific target → belongs in `Repo-Specific Targets`; **preserve verbatim** — never delete, rename, reorder, or regenerate it ([MAKE-REPO-SPECIFIC]).
  - (v) Editor extension build (`.vsix`/Zed/etc.) with no `rebuild-install-<kind>` target → note for addition ([MAKE-IDE-EXT]). Also flag any **packaging-parity** violation ([MAKE-IDE-EXT-PARITY]): a test/e2e target that builds a separate "test bundle" (different profile, target triple, or staging path) instead of running the one packaging recipe the release ships, or a release/test/install path that does not share a single manifest-driven staging helper.
  Flag cross-platform violations ([MAKE-CROSS-PLATFORM]): raw `rm -rf`/`mkdir -p` instead of `$(RM)`/`$(MKDIR)`. If a `justfile`/`Taskfile.yml` is used instead, ask the user before replacing.
- **2d. Linter configs.** Look for legacy/alternate-name configs per spec [LINT]. ESLint v0-v8 files → `eslint.config.mjs`. Old Prettier variants → `.prettierrc.json`. Python `.flake8`/`setup.cfg`/`tox.ini` → Basilisk+ruff+pyright ([LINT-PYTHON-BASILISK]). `.golangci.yaml` → `.golangci.yml`. Migrating means **delete the old file** once the new one covers it.
- **2e. Formatter configs.** Check CSharpier, Fantomas, Prettier, rustfmt, ruff format per spec [FMT] / [FMT-TOOLS]. `[tool.black]` in pyproject → migrate to `[tool.ruff.format]`.
- **2f. Coverage.** Check for `coverage-thresholds.json` at repo root (spec [COVERAGE-THRESHOLDS-JSON]). Flag any legacy threshold storage for migration:
  - `vars.COVERAGE_THRESHOLD*` in workflows
  - `COVERAGE_THRESHOLD ?= …` in Makefile
  - Hardcoded numbers in CI YAML (`--lines 90`, `--fail-under 85`)
  - `gh variable list 2>/dev/null | grep -i COVERAGE`
  - Shell scripts (`scripts/check_coverage.sh`, etc.) — replaced by the `_coverage_check` Make recipe
  - `.coveragerc` vs `pyproject.toml [tool.coverage]` — don't have both
- **2g. Gitignore.** Read existing `.gitignore` in full. Per spec [GITIGNORE] and [GITIGNORE-RULES]:
  - **NEVER add ignores for:** `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.agents/`, `.cline/`, `.clinerules/`, `.opencode/`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or any AI agent config/skill directories. These MUST be committed.
  - **If the existing `.gitignore` already ignores any of the above**, remove those lines — they are bugs.
  - Add only clearly-safe patterns: OS junk (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`), build artifacts (`target/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`), secrets (`.env`, `*.pem`), and tool caches. Do not duplicate or replace patterns already present.
- **2h. LICENSE.** Check for `LICENSE`/`LICENSE.md`/`LICENSE.txt`/`LICENCE`/`COPYING`/`UNLICENSE`. If missing, record for the Step 5 big warning. **Do NOT create one** — license choice has legal consequences and must be the user's decision.
- **2i. GitHub repo settings.** Run `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO`. If `gh` is unavailable/unauthenticated/returns nulls, STOP and emit the warning below verbatim, then wait for explicit YES/NO:

  ```
  ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
  ║  ⚠️  WARNING: GitHub repo settings COULD NOT BE READ  ⚠️        ║
  ╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣

  ║  2. REPO NORMALIZATION: merge strategy, branch protection,       ║

  ║                                                                   ║
  ║  To fix: run `gh auth login` then re-run this skill.             ║
  ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

  Do you want to continue WITHOUT applying GitHub repo settings?
  Answering YES means CI workflow assumptions may be wrong and repo
  settings will NOT be normalized.

  → Type YES to continue anyway, or NO to abort and fix gh access first.
  ```

  - NO → stop. Tell the user to run `gh auth login` and re-invoke.
  - YES → note "GitHub settings skipped — gh unavailable" in the Step 5 report and continue.
  - If `gh` works → compare against `{{STANDARDS_REPO}}/agent-pmo-skill/templates/.github/common-repo-settings.md` and only apply the diffs.

- **2j. Deslop duplication gate** (spec [CI-DESLOP]; docs https://deslop.live/docs/for-ai/). Only if the repo's language is Deslop-supported — **Rust, C#, Dart, Python**. Otherwise skip and note "no Deslop-supported language". When it applies, record what's missing: (i) committed `.deslop.toml` at repo root with `[threshold] max_duplication_percent`; (ii) the Deslop install + `deslop .` gate step in `ci.yml`; (iii) the **Duplication — Deslop** section in the canonical instruction file telling the agent to use the `find-similar`/`rescan`/`top-offenders` MCP loop. Flag any anti-patterns: a hardcoded `--fail-over <N>` number in CI YAML, a threshold in a GitHub variable/env var instead of `.deslop.toml`, or a threshold that was raised without justification.

### Step 3 — Apply standards (merge-first, DO NOT commit/push)

For every item: (1) compliant equivalent exists → leave alone; (2) equivalent exists under wrong name/content → rename/update in place; (3) nothing equivalent → create from template.

- **3a. Docs folder.** Rename `doco/`/`documentation/`/`doc/`/`documents/` → `docs/`. Merge if both exist, then delete the non-standard one. Create `docs/specs/` and `docs/plans/`. Classify loose markdown files: specs = behavior/requirements; plans = how-to with TODO checklists. Update internal references that pointed to the old folder name.
- **3a-ii. Spec ID rule.** Ensure the rule is present in the canonical instruction file. Validation/renaming of existing spec IDs is the `spec-check` skill's job, not this one.
- **3b. Makefile.** Per spec [MAKE-TARGETS], [MAKE-REPO-SPECIFIC], [MAKE-IDE-EXT], [MAKE-TEMPLATE]. Edit the existing Makefile **surgically** — never overwrite the whole file to "regenerate" it. The Makefile has two sections:
  - `Standard Targets` — canonical names (`build`, `test`, `lint`, `fmt`, `clean`, `ci`, `setup`), but ONLY the subset that applies to this repo. No synonyms, no extras here, and no hollow no-op target added just to complete the set.
  - `Repo-Specific Targets` — a separate section below, owned by the repo, varies per repo, **preserved byte-for-byte** unless agent-pmo stamped it.

  Act on the Step 2c classification:
  - (i) applicable standard target missing/wrong → add/fix in `Standard Targets`. A standard target that doesn't apply here is NOT missing — leave it out.
  - (ii) synonym/duplicate of a standard target → merge useful logic into the standard target, delete the duplicate, update callers.
  - (iii) orphan → [MARKER-CLEANUP]: merge useful logic into the correct standard target, delete the orphan.
  - (iv) genuine repo-specific target → leave it exactly as-is. If it sits inside `Standard Targets`, move it down into `Repo-Specific Targets` unchanged. Never delete, rename, reorder, or "tidy up".
  - (v) editor extension with no `rebuild-install-<kind>` target → add one in `Repo-Specific Targets` ([MAKE-IDE-EXT]): uninstall → clean → rebuild → package → install-if-supported, via underscore-prefixed sub-recipes. Enforce parity ([MAKE-IDE-EXT-PARITY]): factor packaging into ONE recipe shared by `rebuild-install-<kind>`, the test/e2e target (which runs it BEFORE testing), and the release workflow, so the tested bundle is byte-for-byte the shipped bundle. Fold any separate "test build" into that one recipe.

  Other rules from the spec: cross-platform ([MAKE-CROSS-PLATFORM]); `_lint` and `_fmt` do not overlap; `_test` uses the fail-fast flag AND calls `_coverage_check` last ([TEST-RULES]); uncomment only the language blocks that apply.
- **3c. GitHub Actions workflows.** Rename the existing workflow from Step 2b rather than creating a parallel one. Follow spec [CI-WORKFLOWS], [CI-JOBS], [CI-TEMPLATE], [CI-RELEASE], [CI-SHIPWRIGHT], [CI-PAGES]. Default to a single `ci` job with sequential steps `make lint → make test → make build`; only split into parallel jobs if individual tasks are 5+ minutes each. **Every job MUST have `timeout-minutes: 10`** — deviate only with a comment above explaining why:
  ```yaml
  # TIMEOUT EXCEPTION: Full integration test suite against live staging env requires ~15 min
  timeout-minutes: 15
  ```

  For release workflows, ensure every build/publish job uses the tagged SHA and runner-local version
  stamping only.

  **CRITICAL — developer-tool repos:** if Step 1 flagged this repo as a developer tool, run the
  `shipwright-compliance` skill and follow it end to end (spec [CI-SHIPWRIGHT]). Record the outcome
  in the Step 5 report.
- **3c-ii. Deslop duplication gate** (spec [CI-DESLOP]). Only for Deslop-supported languages (Rust, C#, Dart, Python); skip otherwise.
  - Create `.deslop.toml` at the repo root from `templates/.deslop.toml`. Set `max_duplication_percent` to the repo's **currently measured** duplication (ratchet from measured — never invent a looser number). If you cannot measure it now, leave the template default and note it for the user to tighten.
  - Add the Deslop install + `deslop .` gate step to `ci.yml` from `templates/.github/workflows/ci.yml` (after `make lint`). Pin `DESLOP_VERSION`. The gate reads `.deslop.toml` — **never** hardcode the threshold in YAML.
  - Ensure the canonical instruction file keeps the **Duplication — Deslop** section (the `find-similar` before / `rescan` + `top-offenders` after MCP loop). This is preserved/added in 3h.
  - Ratchet is **downward only**: never raise `max_duplication_percent` without explicit written PR justification.
- **3d. Coverage.** Read spec [TEST] in full before doing anything here. `make test` = fail-fast + coverage + threshold, one indivisible operation. Thresholds ONLY in `coverage-thresholds.json` per [COVERAGE-THRESHOLDS-JSON].

  This skill must:
  - Create `coverage-thresholds.json` at the repo root from `templates/coverage-calc/coverage-thresholds.json`. Set `default_threshold` per [COVERAGE-THRESHOLDS]. For multi-project repos, list each project with its **currently measured** threshold (ratchet from measured — never above).
  - Migrate every legacy threshold storage found in Step 2f into the JSON. Delete the old storage (env blocks, Makefile defaults, shell scripts, public `coverage*` targets). For GitHub repo variables, instruct the user to delete them from Settings → Variables → Actions (this skill can't delete them).
  - Wire `_coverage_check` into `_test`. Keep it private — it is never a public target. Reference the language-specific commented blocks in `templates/Makefile`.
  - Verify `ci.yml` has NO `coverage-check`/`coverage` step and NO `COVERAGE_THRESHOLD` env vars. The workflow just calls `make lint`, `make test`, `make build`.
  - .NET: `coverlet.runsettings` per [COVERAGE-COVERLET]. Python: `pyproject.toml [tool.coverage]` only (no `.coveragerc`). TypeScript/Jest: [COVERAGE-JEST].
  - Thresholds are monotonically increasing. Reject PRs that lower a threshold unless explicitly justified.
- **3e. Linter configs.** Apply spec [LINT] and the per-language sections ([LINT-RUST], [LINT-TS-ESLINT], [LINT-TS-PRETTIER], [LINT-TS-STRICT], [LINT-PYTHON-BASILISK], [LINT-DART], [LINT-GO], [LINT-CSHARP], [LINT-FSHARP]). Merge into existing `pyproject.toml`/`Cargo.toml`/`tsconfig.json` — don't clobber non-lint sections. Delete superseded files (`.eslintrc.*`, `.flake8`, `setup.cfg [flake8]`, `.golangci.yaml`, etc.) after migration.
- **3f. Formatting.** Apply spec [FMT] / [FMT-TOOLS] / [FMT-PYTHON] / [FMT-MULTI]. `make fmt`, `make lint`, `make test` are three separate, non-overlapping targets.
- **3g-pre. Gitignore remediation.** Before applying GitHub settings, fix `.gitignore` per spec [GITIGNORE-RULES]: scan the file for any line that ignores `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.agents/`, `.cline/`, `.clinerules/`, `.opencode/`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, or similar AI/IDE config paths. **Delete those lines** — they are bugs, not features. Then append patterns from `templates/gitignore/universal.gitignore` and the relevant language gitignore(s), skipping duplicates.
- **3g. GitHub repo settings.** Apply spec [GITHUB-SETTINGS] / [GITHUB-MERGE] / [GITHUB-FEATURES] / [GITHUB-PROTECTION] / [GITHUB-CLI] via the commands in `templates/.github/common-repo-settings.md`. Applies to both new and existing repos. If the repo is local-only (no remote yet), skip and note for after-first-push. If `gh` was skipped in Step 2i, skip here too and record in the Step 5 report.
- **3g-dep. Dependabot** (spec [GITHUB-DEPENDABOT]). Supply-chain defense without PR spam, and no CI on routine bumps — applies to **every** repo. Routine version bumps target a long-lived `dependabot-upgrades` staging branch that runs zero CI; the batch reaches `main` via one consolidation PR.
  - Write `.github/dependabot.yml` from `templates/.github/dependabot.yml`. Keep the `github-actions` block (any repo with workflows; version-only). Keep only the `package-ecosystem` blocks whose manifests exist in this repo (detect from Step 1's language scan); delete the rest. **Every block must set `target-branch: "dependabot-upgrades"`.** Each LANGUAGE ecosystem needs BOTH a `version-updates` group AND a `<eco>-security` group (`applies-to: security-updates`), each `patterns:["*"]` with no `update-types` — never leave one ungrouped, never split minor/major.
  - Write `.github/workflows/dependabot-automerge.yml` from `templates/.github/workflows/dependabot-automerge.yml` — it sweeps EVERY dependabot[bot] PR into staging with `git merge -X theirs` (latest bump clobbers previous), triggering on BOTH `dependabot-upgrades` and `main` (security PRs are force-opened against `main`). Then add the Dependabot skip to `ci.yml`/`codeql.yml`: keep them `pull_request: [main]`-only (never add `branches: [dependabot-upgrades]`) AND gate against the bot — a job-level `if: github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]'` on the CI/security jobs, and `&& github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]'` appended to the CodeQL visibility gate — so a security PR on `main` never burns the matrix on a bump that is immediately swept away.
  - Cut the `dependabot-upgrades` branch from `main` AFTER `dependabot.yml` + `dependabot-automerge.yml` are on `main` (so the staging branch carries the auto-merge workflow): `gh api -X POST repos/$REPO/git/refs -f ref=refs/heads/dependabot-upgrades -f sha=$(gh api repos/$REPO/git/ref/heads/main --jq .object.sha)`. If `gh` was skipped or the repo is local-only, record for after-first-push.
  - Enable per-repo alerts + security updates: `gh api -X PUT repos/$REPO/vulnerability-alerts` and `gh api -X PUT repos/$REPO/automated-security-fixes`. If `gh` was skipped, record for after-first-push.
  - Grouped security updates and "auto-enable for new repos" are account/org-level toggles — note them in the Step 5 report for the user to set in **Settings → Code security** (this skill can't toggle org settings).
- **3g-sec. Code scanning + secret scanning** (spec [GITHUB-CODE-SCANNING] / [GITHUB-DEP-REVIEW] / [GITHUB-SECRET-SCANNING]). Every PR must undergo security scanning, with no coverage overlap between linting, CodeQL, and dependency review.
  - **CodeQL — tailor the matrix at runtime, do NOT copy a frozen language list.**
    1. List the languages actually present in this repo (Step 1 language scan).
    2. Determine which languages **CodeQL supports right now**, at skill-run time — check live (CodeQL docs, or `codeql resolve languages` if the CLI is available). CodeQL's set grows (Rust was added; more will follow); the list in the spec is illustrative only.
    3. Write `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` from `templates/.github/workflows/codeql.yml` with one matrix `include:` entry per language in the **intersection** of 1 and 2, plus `actions` (always). Use `build-mode: none` for interpreted langs + rust/csharp; `autobuild`/manual for compiled langs that need a build (go, java-kotlin, c-cpp). Keep the SHA-pinned action versions and the `if: ...visibility == 'public'` gate.
    4. **Triggers:** `pull_request` to main, `schedule` (weekly), and `workflow_call` exposing a `gate` boolean input. NEVER add `push: branches:[main]`. **NEVER a standalone `push: tags` scan** — it runs alongside the release and can only file alerts *after* the artifact ships, so it cannot gate anything.
    5. **Wire the HARD release gate — CodeQL MUST be able to stop a release.** If the repo ships releases (`release.yml` exists), add a `codeql` job that `uses: ./.github/workflows/codeql.yml` `with: { gate: true }` (job-level `permissions: security-events: write, actions: read, contents: read`) and add it to the `needs:` of the `release` job — so it transitively gates every publish job. With `gate: true` the analyze job parses its SARIF and FAILS on any finding whose `security-severity` is High/Critical (>= 7.0); a dirty scan then blocks publishing. A release MUST NOT be able to ship code CodeQL flagged. The gated call also scans the exact released SHA with the current query set.
    6. **If the intersection is empty** (e.g. Dart/Flutter- or F#-only repo), do NOT write codeql.yml and add no gate job — record in the Step 5 report that no CodeQL-supported language was found.
  - **COMBINE — anti-duplication is mandatory (duplicate analysis wastes GitHub Actions minutes = money).** Before adding anything, AUDIT the repo's existing workflows and configs and enforce **exactly one owner per concern**; delete the loser:
    - Style/correctness → linters in `make lint`. **Strip any security-rule linter plugins** (eslint-plugin-security, gosec, bandit, semgrep-in-CI) that re-cover CodeQL.
    - Vulnerable code → CodeQL only. **Check Settings → Code security: if GitHub default-setup CodeQL is ON, turn it OFF** when committing `codeql.yml` (advanced setup) — running both scans the same code twice.
    - Vulnerable dependencies → exactly ONE of dependency-review OR a native vuln-gate (osv-scanner/cargo-deny/npm audit). If the repo already has a vuln-gate (e.g. Shipwright's `SWR-SEC-VULN-GATE`), **do NOT also add dependency-review**.
    - Secrets → GitHub secret scanning + push protection (platform, zero CI minutes). **Remove any trufflehog/gitleaks CI jobs** the platform feature makes redundant.
  - **Dependency review:** if the repo has NO native vuln-gate, ensure `ci.yml` has the `security` job from `templates/.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`actions/dependency-review-action`, `fail-on-severity: high`). Skip if a vuln-gate already covers deps, or if there are no manifests.
  - **Secret scanning + push protection:** enable via the `gh api -X PATCH ... security_and_analysis` command in `templates/.github/common-repo-settings.md`. If `gh` was skipped or the repo is private without GHAS, record for the user.
- **3g-pol. Security policy** (spec [GITHUB-SECURITY-POLICY]). Every repo needs one.
  - Write `SECURITY.md` at the repo root (or `.github/SECURITY.md`) from `templates/SECURITY.md`. Fill every placeholder (`{{OWNER}}`, `{{REPO}}`, `{{SECURITY_CONTACT_EMAIL}}`) and set the supported-versions table to the repo's real release lines. Keep the GitHub doc URLs.
  - Enable private vulnerability reporting: `gh api -X PUT repos/$REPO/private-vulnerability-reporting`. If `gh` was skipped or the repo is private without GHAS, record for the user.
- **3h. Agent instruction files.** Per spec [AGENT] / [AGENT-TEMPLATE] / [AGENT-POINTERS].

  **The canonical file MUST be fully customised.** Fill every placeholder, strip every language/tool/framework section that does not apply, fill the project overview and architecture section with real content. The test: ZERO references to languages or tools the repo does not use. **Keep the `Duplication — Deslop` section iff the repo is in a Deslop-supported language** (Rust, C#, Dart, Python) per [CI-DESLOP]; delete it otherwise.

  1. Write the canonical file. **Default to the generic `AGENTS.md` for every agent, Claude included** ([DESIGN] 5a, [AGENT-PLACEMENT]) — unless a pre-existing canonical `CLAUDE.md` was detected, in which case merge into it. (Copilot's own file is `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.)
  2. **Disable auto-memory** per [AGENT-AUTOMEMORY]: for Claude Code, ensure a committed `.claude/settings.local.json` contains `"autoMemoryEnabled": false` (create from `templates/.claude/settings.local.json`, or merge the key into an existing file — never overwrite existing keys; force-committed per [GITIGNORE-RULES]); for other agents disable the equivalent per [AGENT-DOCS].
  3. Every other agent instruction file becomes a trivial pointer to the canonical file. See spec [AGENT-POINTERS]. **Strip existing content** from non-canonical files — no headings, no preamble, no leftover rules — leave only the marker line and `@<canonical_file>` redirect. Use `templates/CLAUDE.md` as the pointer template.
  4. Place skills from `templates/skills/` into the target agent's native directory per spec [SKILL-PLACEMENT]. Apply spec [MODES-CUSTOMIZE]:
     - Language-customizable skills (`code-dedup`, `ci-prep`, `upgrade-packages`): strip irrelevant language sections, fill placeholders.
     - Content-preserving skills (`website-audit`, `spec-check`, `submit-pr`, any skill without multi-language examples): copy the step-by-step procedure verbatim. Add repo-specific context if useful, but never drop/merge/summarize/rewrite/gut steps. Diff source vs output — the only differences should be repo-specific additions.

  If an existing canonical file has substantial custom content, **merge** into it instead of overwriting. Result must read as a coherent document for this repo, not a generic template with the name swapped in.
- **3h-web. Website theme + upgrade** (only if the repo has a website). Per spec [WEB-TECHDOC] / [WEB-UPGRADE]:
  - Dev-tool/docs sites MUST use `eleventy-plugin-techdoc` on Eleventy 3.x. If on another theme/SSG, flag for migration.
  - **Always upgrade `eleventy-plugin-techdoc` (and `@11ty/eleventy`) to latest**, update the lockfile, and rebuild.
  - **Then run the `website-audit` skill** and record the result in the Step 5 report.
- **3i. VS Code title bar colorization** (only if `.vscode/` or `.vscode/settings.json` exists).
  1. Find the project's primary brand color. Check in order: `designsystem/`/`design-system/`/`design/`, CSS custom properties (`--color-*`, `--brand-*`, `--primary`) in `website/`/`site/`/`docs/`, `tailwind.config.*` theme, `theme.*`/`colors.*` files, README color scheme.
  2. Extract the dominant accent (not white/black/grey).
  3. Merge into `.vscode/settings.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
         "titleBar.activeBackground": "<primary-brand-color>",
         "titleBar.activeForeground": "<contrasting-text-color>",
         "titleBar.inactiveBackground": "<darker-shade-of-primary>",
         "titleBar.inactiveForeground": "<contrasting-text-color-with-opacity>"
       }
     }
     ```
     Inactive background = slightly darker/desaturated primary. Inactive foreground = active foreground with ~80% opacity (append `cc` to hex).
  4. If no brand colors can be found anywhere, **skip** and note in the report. Do NOT invent colors.
- **3j. VS Code recommended extensions.** Merge `templates/vscode/universal.extensions.json` into `.vscode/extensions.json`. If the repo has a web API (REST/GraphQL/HTTP server), also merge `webapi.extensions.json`. De-duplicate the `recommendations` array. Create `.vscode/` if absent.

### Step 4 — Deduplication check

After all changes, verify:

1. **CI workflows** — exactly one `ci.yml`, at most one `release.yml`, at most one `deploy-pages.yml`. Delete any legacy siblings.
2. **Linter configs** — one config per tool per language. No both-of pairs (e.g. `eslint.config.mjs` AND `.eslintrc.json`; `.prettierrc` AND `.prettierrc.json`; `.golangci.yml` AND `.golangci.yaml`; `.flake8` AND `pyproject.toml [tool.ruff]`).
3. **Coverage configs** — no both-of (`.coveragerc` AND `[tool.coverage]`). No leftover coverage shell scripts.
4. **Formatter configs** — one per tool. No both-of (`[tool.black]` AND `[tool.ruff.format]`).
5. **Build files** — no competing systems with identical targets (e.g. `Makefile` AND `Taskfile.yml`).
5b. **Deslop** (supported-language repos) — exactly one `.deslop.toml` holding the threshold; `ci.yml` has the `deslop .` gate with no hardcoded threshold; no duplicate threshold in env vars/GH variables. ([CI-DESLOP])
6. **Docs folders** — exactly one, called `docs/`. `docs/specs/` and `docs/plans/` exist. No loose markdown that belongs in a subdir.
7. **Skills** — no duplicates across agent-native skill directories. Consolidate to the primary agent's dir per spec [SKILL-PLACEMENT].
8. **Agent instruction files** — exactly ONE canonical file with full rules. All others are pointers (marker + `@<canonical>` only). Rename legacy pointer filenames (`.clinerules/00-read-claude-md.md` → `.clinerules/00-read-instructions.md`).
9. **Orphaned `agent-pmo:` files** — per spec [MARKER-CLEANUP]: for every marked file, verify the source still exists in `{{STANDARDS_REPO}}/agent-pmo-skill/templates/`. If not, delete the orphan.
10. **Stale markers** — flag files more than 50 commits behind current standards HEAD per spec [MARKER-AUDIT].
11. **Report** all duplicates deleted, orphans removed, stale markers found. When unsure whether something is a duplicate or a genuine repo-specific artifact, **ask the user** — never delete "to be tidy".

Merging multiple files into one is a valid outcome and overrides the no-delete default.

### Step 5 — Verify (DO NOT commit)

1. List every file created, modified, renamed, or deleted (including Make targets merged/removed).
2. If possible, run `make lint` and `make test` to validate. Report errors so the user can fix them.
3. **LICENSE check.** If no license file was found in Step 2h, emit the banner at the **top** of the final report — impossible to miss, do not soften, do not omit:

   ```
   ================================================================================
   !!!  WARNING — NO LICENSE FILE FOUND  !!!
   ================================================================================
   This repository has NO LICENSE file. Under default copyright law this means
   "all rights reserved" — nobody (including contributors) has permission to use,
   copy, modify, or distribute this code.

   You MUST add a LICENSE file. Common choices:
     - MIT          — permissive, simple
     - Apache-2.0   — permissive, patent grant
     - GPL-3.0      — copyleft
     - BSD-3-Clause — permissive
     - Proprietary  — all rights reserved (explicit)

   This skill will NOT create a LICENSE file for you — the choice has legal
   consequences and must be made deliberately.
   ================================================================================
   ```
4. Remind the user: **No commits or pushes were made. Review the changes and commit when ready.**
