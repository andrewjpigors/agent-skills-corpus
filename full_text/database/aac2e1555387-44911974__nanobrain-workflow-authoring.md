# nanobrain-workflow-authoring

## ⚠️ Read first — silent-failure shapes

The framework's static validators catch structural errors (cycles, orphans,
unknown step IDs). They do **not** catch the four dominant runtime
silent-failure shapes that make a workflow appear to work while producing
nothing useful. Cross-reference `architecture.md §13` for the brutal-truth
list. Summary:

1. **Every `DirectLink` in your YAML must declare `auto_transfer: true`.**
   Default is False. Without the flag, the link silently no-ops on every
   trigger. (Gap **G7** proposes flipping the default in `config_version: 2`.)
2. **`AllDataReceivedTrigger`'s expected set is bound at trigger init.** A
   gated-off layer that never publishes deadlocks the trigger. (Gap **G2**
   proposes a dynamic `expected_set_source`; gap **G10** proposes
   gate-to-bottom semantics.)
3. **Workflow-level data unit shape mismatch silently drops payloads.** Both
   `input_data_units` and `output_data_units` must be declared at workflow
   level AND the link's `target` must match a declared workflow output by
   exact name.
4. **Trigger payload wrapping (`{unit_name: payload}` envelope) is the
   framework's responsibility.** A step's `process()` sees the **raw payload**;
   if you wrap it again you ship a doubly-wrapped value downstream.
5. **A `Workflow` instance owns MUTABLE data units — do not run one instance
   concurrently from two callers.** `Workflow.run()` now serializes overlapping
   runs on the SAME instance via a per-instance lock (`_get_run_lock`, 2026-06-14),
   so a cached-per-process workflow (an MCP server fielding overlapping requests)
   no longer silently returns one caller's result to another — but the cost is that
   same-instance runs queue. For true parallelism, build a DISTINCT instance per
   concurrent run (distinct instances keep distinct locks and run fully in parallel).
   Deciding success from the run's `status` field would have missed this entirely:
   every contaminated run reported `status: completed` (G127 — assert on output
   VALUES). A SubworkflowStep in the cascade drives a different instance, so nesting
   does not deadlock.

After every workflow change, call `Workflow.wait_for_cascade(timeout, settle_ms)`
synchronously after `process()` and assert the workflow-level outputs
actually carry your expected payload — don't trust trigger-cascade
"completion" without checking the data.

### Pre-execution validation across all three authoring paths (2026-05-11)

CLAUDE.md describes three legit workflow-authoring paths. All three
now route through the same framework-rule validator before runtime:

| Path | Validator entry point | Surfaces violations as |
|---|---|---|
| Hand-authored YAML | `Workflow.from_config(path)` | Framework `ValueError` / `ComponentConfigurationError` |
| LLM composer | `Composer.compose(prompt)` | Structured `WorkflowValidationError` with per-rule `WorkflowViolation` records; retries once with feedback payload (C1) |
| Lightweight `WorkflowBuilder` | `validate_and_load(builder)` from `apecx_integration.composition.lightweight_validator` | Structured `WorkflowValidationError` (same payload as composer) |

The structured surface (`rule_id`, `path`, `message`,
`suggested_fix`) is the same across paths so retry / repair logic
can be reused.

## Alignment-audit findings — author validation/repair as Steps, not pseudocode

Per `nanobrain_alignment_audit.md` F-2, F-3, F-6: the 5-gate validation
pipeline and the repair loop are **nanobrain Steps connected by Links**, not
imperative Python. If you find yourself writing a custom Python "validator
runner" or "repair loop" outside the workflow YAML, stop — it's a duplicate
of `LoopController` (gap **G18**) and `BaseStep` (existing). Cross-reference
`agent_workflow_authoring.md §6` for the canonical 5-gate-as-Steps shape.

## Why this skill exists

A workflow is the wiring diagram for a multi-step computation. Get it wrong
and you'll get one of: a step that never fires, a deadlock from a self-loop,
an `Orphaned steps found (no connections)` validation error, or a workflow that
"runs" but produces no output because no link connects to the workflow's
declared outputs (or every link silently no-ops; see warning above).

## File:line ground truth

| Concern | File | Approx. line |
|---|---|---|
| `Workflow` (subclasses `Step`) | `nanobrain/nanobrain/core/workflow.py` | ~466 |
| `WorkflowConfig` schema | `nanobrain/nanobrain/core/workflow.py` | 38–96 |
| `_init_from_config` for Workflow | `nanobrain/nanobrain/core/workflow.py` | 1554–1632 |
| Step + link registration | `nanobrain/nanobrain/core/workflow.py` | 1131–1140 |
| Step lookup error | `nanobrain/nanobrain/core/workflow.py` | 1281–1282 |
| `WorkflowGraph` (DAG) | `nanobrain/nanobrain/core/workflow_graph.py` | full file |
| `validate_graph` | `nanobrain/nanobrain/core/workflow_graph.py` | 286–374 |
| `has_cycles` (DFS) | `nanobrain/nanobrain/core/workflow_graph.py` | 186–213 |

## Mental model

A workflow is a **Step** (literally inherits from `Step`). It has its own
`input_data_units` and `output_data_units` — these are the workflow's
entry/exit ports. Inside, it owns:

- `child_steps: Dict[str, BaseStep]` — the steps it orchestrates
- `step_links: Dict[str, LinkBase]` — the links wiring data between steps
- a `WorkflowGraph` — a DAG of step IDs and edges (links)

When the workflow runs, **data flows event-driven**: deposit something into
the workflow's input data unit → the link from that input fires → the first
step's input unit receives data → the first step's trigger fires → it
executes → its output unit fires → the next link fires → and so on, until the
workflow's output unit gets written.

## Minimal workflow YAML

```yaml
# config/two_step_workflow.yml
name: two_step_workflow
description: "Reads input, processes, returns result"

input_data_units:
  raw_input:
    class: "nanobrain.core.data_unit.DataUnitMemory"
    name: raw_input

output_data_units:
  final_result:
    class: "nanobrain.core.data_unit.DataUnitMemory"
    name: final_result

steps:
  prep:
    class: my_project.steps.PreparationStep
    config: config/prep_step.yml

  aggregate:
    class: my_project.steps.AggregationStep
    config: config/aggregate_step.yml

links:
  input_to_prep:
    class: "nanobrain.core.link.DirectLink"
    config:
      source: "raw_input"          # workflow-level data unit
      target: "prep.input"         # step's input unit
      link_type: direct

  prep_to_aggregate:
    class: "nanobrain.core.link.DirectLink"
    config:
      source: "prep.output"
      target: "aggregate.input"
      link_type: direct

  aggregate_to_output:
    class: "nanobrain.core.link.DirectLink"
    config:
      source: "aggregate.output"
      target: "final_result"       # workflow-level data unit
      link_type: direct
```

## Fully featured (mixed-execution) workflow

This pattern is the canonical reference; it uses workflow-level data units,
multiple executors, and Academy links for HPC delegation.

```yaml
# config/mixed_execution_workflow_aurora.yml
name: academylink_aurora_workflow
version: "2.0"

input_data_units:
  raw_input:
    class: "nanobrain.core.data_unit.DataUnitMemory"
    name: raw_input
    persistent: false

output_data_units:
  final_results:
    class: "nanobrain.core.data_unit.DataUnitMemory"
    name: final_results
    persistent: false

executors:
  local_executor:
    executor_type: local
    name: local_executor
    max_workers: 2
    timeout: 60
  aurora_executor:
    executor_type: parsl
    name: aurora_executor
    parsl_config_file: ../aurora_parsl_executor.yml
    timeout: 600

steps:
  data_preparation:
    class: demos.academylink_aurora_demo.steps.DataPreparationStep
    config: config/data_preparation_step.yml
    executor: local_executor
  aurora_computation:
    class: demos.academylink_aurora_demo.steps.AuroraComputationStep
    config: config/aurora_computation_step.yml
    executor: aurora_executor
  result_aggregation:
    class: demos.academylink_aurora_demo.steps.ResultAggregationStep
    config: config/result_aggregation_step.yml
    executor: local_executor

links:
  aurora_computation_link:
    class: "nanobrain.academy_integration.academy_link.AcademyLink"
    config: "config/aurora_computation_link.yml"
  aurora_results_link:
    class: "nanobrain.academy_integration.academy_link.AcademyLink"
    config: "config/aurora_results_link.yml"

execution:
  timeout: 600
  retry_attempts: 2
  parallel_execution: false
```

need a working reference.

## WorkflowConfig schema

Inherits StepConfig fields, adds:

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enable_monitoring` | bool | true | Enables resource monitor |
| `max_parallel_steps` | int | 10 | Concurrency cap |
| `step_timeout` | float | 300 | Per-step default timeout |
| `retry_attempts` | int | 3 | On step failure |
| `retry_delay` | float | 1.0 | Seconds between retries |
| `allow_cycles` | bool | false | If true, validation tolerates cycles (rare) |
| `validate_graph` | bool | true | Run DAG validation at init |
| `require_connected_graph` | bool | true | Disconnected components → error |
| `steps` | Dict[str, StepRef] | {} | Map of step_id → class+config |
| `links` | Dict[str, LinkRef] | {} | Map of link_id → class+config |
| `executors` | Dict[str, ExecutorConfig] | {} | Named executors usable by steps |

A `StepRef` is `{class: "...", config: "...", executor: "name"}`. A `LinkRef`
is `{class: "...", config: "..."}`. The `executor` field on a step ref
references one of the named entries in the workflow's `executors` map.

## How executors are resolved per step

```yaml
steps:
  heavy_step:
    class: my_project.steps.HeavyStep
    config: config/heavy_step.yml
    executor: aurora_executor   # name from workflow's `executors:` map
```

The workflow's `_init_from_config` builds each named executor from its config,
then injects it into each step's dependencies during the step's own
`from_config` call. If a step doesn't specify `executor:`, it inherits the
workflow's executor.

## Link wiring and dot notation

Source/target strings use dot notation: `step_id.data_unit_name` or just
`workflow_data_unit_name` for workflow-level units.

```yaml
links:
  prep_to_compute:
    class: "nanobrain.core.link.DirectLink"
    config:
      source: "prep.output"          # step prep's output data unit
      target: "compute.input"        # step compute's input data unit
      link_type: direct
```

Invalid forms the framework rejects:

- `source: "prep"` → missing data unit; `Invalid reference: prep. Must use 'step.data_unit' format`.
- `source: "prep:output"` → wrong separator (colon instead of dot); same error.
- `source: "prep.output"`, `target: "prep.output"` → self-reference;
  `❌ ILLEGAL SELF-REFERENCING LINK: {link_id} connects step '{prep}' to itself.`

See the dedicated skill `nanobrain-data-units-triggers-links` for full link
type taxonomy.

## DAG validation rules

`WorkflowGraph.validate_graph` runs at workflow initialization (when
`validate_graph: true`, which is the default). It enforces:

1. **Non-empty graph.** `Workflow graph is empty - no steps defined`.
2. **No cycles** (unless `allow_cycles: true`).
   `⚠️ WORKFLOW CYCLES DETECTED: This workflow contains cycles. Ensure that appropriate resolution mechanisms are in place...`
3. **Connected** (unless `require_connected_graph: false`).
   `Workflow graph is not connected - contains isolated components`.
4. **No orphans** (steps with no inbound and no outbound edges, when there's
   more than one step).
   `Orphaned steps found (no connections): [...]`.
5. **No self-referencing links.**
   `❌ ILLEGAL SELF-REFERENCING LINK: {link_id} connects step '{source_id}' to itself.
   Self-referencing links are prohibited in the workflow architecture as they
   create infinite trigger loops and prevent proper workflow execution.`

If any rule is violated, the workflow raises an error during `from_config` and
never reaches a runnable state.

## Execution model

**Event-driven (default).** You don't tell the framework "run step A, then B".
You deposit data into the workflow's input data unit, and the trigger graph
takes over. Step A's trigger fires when its input arrives; A runs; A writes
output; the link to B fires; B's trigger fires; etc.

**Imperative (rare, opt-in via `divergence_enabled` etc.).** A topological
sort of the DAG is generated and the workflow walks the order itself. Use
only when event-driven flow is structurally impossible (e.g., a step that
fans out and rejoins).

For 99% of workflows: event-driven is correct. Set up your data units and
triggers properly and the framework runs the graph for you.

## Workflow vs. Step ownership

| Owns | Workflow | Step |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow-level entry/exit data units | ✅ | — |
| Step's `input_data_units`, `output_data_units` | — | ✅ |
| Step's `triggers` | — | ✅ |
| `child_steps` map | ✅ | — |
| `step_links` map (links between steps) | ✅ | — |
| Named executors usable across steps | ✅ | — |
| Per-step executor binding | ✅ (assigns) | ✅ (uses) |

If you find yourself wanting the workflow to manipulate a step's internal data
unit directly, you are violating the boundary. Add a link.

## Verbatim error messages

```
ValueError: Step '{step_id}' not found in workflow
```
> A link references a non-existent step. Check the `steps:` block names.

```
Workflow graph is empty - no steps defined
```
> Add at least one step.

```
Orphaned steps found (no connections): ['step_a', 'step_b']
```
> These steps have no inbound or outbound links. Either wire them up or remove them.

```
Workflow graph is not connected - contains isolated components
```
> Two disjoint subgraphs exist. Connect them with a link, or split into two workflows.

```
⚠️ WORKFLOW CYCLES DETECTED: This workflow contains cycles. Ensure that
appropriate resolution mechanisms are in place...
```
> A cycle was detected. Either set `allow_cycles: true` (and verify your
> debounce settings prevent infinite firing) or break the cycle.

```
❌ ILLEGAL SELF-REFERENCING LINK: {link_id} connects step '{source_id}' to itself.
Self-referencing links are prohibited in the workflow architecture as they create
infinite trigger loops and prevent proper workflow execution.
```
> Source and target are the same step's data unit. Almost always a typo or
> a wrong design — break the cycle.

## Pitfalls

1. **No link from workflow input to first step.** The workflow input unit
   gets data, but no listener fires. Add `input_to_first_step` link.
2. **No link from last step to workflow output.** The pipeline runs but the
   workflow's declared output never updates; downstream callers see nothing.
3. **Dot-notation typo.** `"step.outpu"` (missing `t`) — silent failure
   because the data unit name doesn't match anything; the link sits there
   waiting forever.
4. **Cycle without debounce.** Even with `allow_cycles: true`, an unthrottled
   cycle fires indefinitely. Use `debounce_ms` on the trigger to throttle.
5. **Step's `executor:` references a name not in `executors:`.** Step
   initialization fails because the dependency cannot be resolved.
6. **Mixed ownership mistake.** Putting a step's I/O units into the
   workflow-level `input_data_units` because "they're the workflow's input
   too" — this conflates entry-point ownership with internal step ownership.
   Keep them separate; wire with a link.

## Checklist

- [ ] Workflow YAML has both `input_data_units` and `output_data_units` at
      the top level (entry/exit ports).
- [ ] Every step is declared under `steps:` with `class:` and `config:`.
- [ ] Every step's input data unit is the target of at least one link
      (otherwise it never fires).
- [ ] Every workflow output data unit is the target of at least one link
      from a step (otherwise the workflow produces nothing).
- [ ] Every link uses dot notation `step.data_unit` or a workflow-level unit name.
- [ ] No self-referencing links.
- [ ] DAG passes `validate_graph` (cycles, orphans, connectedness).
- [ ] Executor names referenced by steps exist in `executors:` block.
- [ ] Smoke test loads the workflow without error; integration test against
      real data is recorded.

## New primitives (2026-05-09 — eval_03 Tier 1-3 chain)

Two ergonomic additions to ``Workflow``:

### ``Workflow.from_skeleton(skeleton, bindings)`` — G9-completion

A *parameterized* workflow loader. The skeleton declares typed holes;
the caller binds them; the framework lowers + loads. Use when the same
workflow shape runs against many parameter sets (or when an LLM agent
picks a skeleton from a registry).

```python
wf = Workflow.from_skeleton(
    "configs/skeletons/rag_pipeline.yml",
    bindings={"corpus": "pubmed_2025_q1", "min_evidence": 5},
)
```

Skeleton input may be a Path/str (YAML file), a Skeleton instance, or
an inline dict. Missing required holes FAIL-FAST; extra binding keys
not declared in skeleton.holes FAIL-FAST. Optional holes get their
declared default. See ``nanobrain/library/orchestration/skeleton.py``
for the Skeleton schema and ``nanobrain/docs/workflow_authoring_paths.md``
for the multi-path picker.

### ``Workflow.run(..., nest_under_active_context=True)`` — G31 runner-side

When invoking a workflow as a **nested sub-workflow** of another
workflow, set ``nest_under_active_context=True`` on the inner ``run()``
call. The framework auto-installs a nested ``WorkflowRunContext`` whose
namespace derives from the outer parent via ``derive_nested_namespace``
(strategy: ``"scoped"`` default, ``"inherit"`` opt-in via
``WorkflowConfig.namespace_strategy``).

```python
# Inside a parent step that invokes a child workflow:
result = await child_workflow.run(
    {"query": "..."},
    nest_under_active_context=True,
)
# child_workflow's data units, capability checks, and provenance
# all key off "<parent_namespace>.<child_workflow_name>" automatically.
```

When False (default): no behavior change; existing top-level callers
unaffected. When True without an outer context: warns + falls through
to non-nested run.

### Capability-token enforcement (G28)

Workflows that load tools with ``requires_capability: [...]`` now have
those tokens enforced at ``ToolExecutionStep.process()`` time. The
runner / caller populates ``WorkflowRunContext.capability_tokens`` on
the active context BEFORE invoking the workflow:

```python
ctx = WorkflowRunContext.from_config({
    "run_id": "abc",
    "capability_tokens": ["hpc.submit", "data.read"],
})
with ctx.activate():
    await workflow.run(...)
```

Missing tokens → ``CapabilityNotGranted`` workflow-terminal exception.

### Cost envelope enforcement (G26)

Long workflows can declare cumulative cost caps via ``CostEnvelope`` +
``CostTracker``. Cost-emitting code paths (LLM client, tool dispatch)
call ``record_cost(kind, amount)`` which checks against the active
tracker's caps:

```python
from nanobrain.core.cost_envelope import CostEnvelope, CostTracker

tracker = CostTracker(CostEnvelope(usd=10.0, tokens=1_000_000))
with tracker.activate():
    await workflow.run(...)  # any record_cost call past the cap raises
```

### Step-level events (G37)

Subscribe to live step lifecycle events (``step_start`` / ``step_complete``
/ ``step_failed``) for dashboards / log shippers / provenance recorders:

```python
from nanobrain.core.step_events import subscribe_to_step_events

events = []
with subscribe_to_step_events(events.append):
    await workflow.run(...)
# events is now a list[StepEvent] with one event per step boundary
```

### Embedding a workflow as a step — ``SubworkflowStep`` (2026-05-12)

When one workflow is naturally a reusable reasoning pattern (write
→ review, decompose → solve → integrate, verify, etc.), embed it
as a single step in a larger workflow rather than redeclaring its
topology each time.

Two usage shapes:

**1. Concrete subclass per pattern (recommended for composer use).**
The composer's RAG matcher sees a concrete step class with a rich
``rag_description``; the workflow-embedding mechanism is invisible.

```python
from nanobrain.library.steps.subworkflow_step import SubworkflowStep

class CodeReflectionStep(SubworkflowStep):
    COMPONENT_TYPE = "code_reflection_step"

    @classmethod
    def _default_inner_workflow_path(cls):
        return "workflows/code_writing/code_reflection_workflow.yml"

    async def process(self, input_data, **kwargs):
        # Explicit override delegates to super(); subclass surface
        # documents its specific input/output shape.
        return await super().process(input_data, **kwargs)
```

**2. Direct config (advanced).** Use ``SubworkflowStep`` directly
with ``inner_workflow_path`` in the step YAML. Do NOT let the
composer author this shape — the path field is a hallucination
surface. Reserved for hand-written workflows.

**3. Builder-sourced inner workflow (E2-F1).** When the inner
workflow exists ONLY as a lightweight ``WorkflowBuilder`` builder
(a no-arg ``build_*()`` returning ``builder.load()``, e.g. apecx's
``viral_conserved_sites``) with no YAML on disk, set
``inner_workflow_builder`` (a dotted-path to that no-arg callable)
INSTEAD of ``inner_workflow_path``. The two are mutually exclusive
(both-set or neither-set → load-time FAIL-FAST); the callable is
resolved + invoked once at step init and the returned ``Workflow``
is cached, so every silent-failure gate below is preserved
unchanged. The callable MUST return a ``Workflow`` (not the builder,
not a dict) — wrong type FAIL-FASTs. **G117 still applies**: the
outer step's own input DU name must differ from the inner
workflow's first-step input DU name. See the ``nanobrain-lightweight``
skill for the full YAML example + regression pointer
(``nanobrain/tests/unit/test_subworkflow_step_builder.py``).

Both paths run the inner workflow via
``inner.process(routed_input) + inner.wait_for_cascade()`` — NOT
``inner.run()``. The wrapper auto-routes ``input_data`` to the
inner workflow's first-step input data unit when there's exactly
one (sidesteps the framework's workflow-level-DU routing gap that
``test_rag_e2e_workflow_yaml.py`` also works around).

Silent-failure discipline (built in, opt-out per-step):

* **Inner step raised → surfaced FAST + accurate (BUG A, 2026-06-13).**
  When an inner step ``process()`` raises, the trigger executor
  SWALLOWS the exception (G127 — ``Workflow.run`` does not propagate
  it), so the inner output DU never populates. ``SubworkflowStep``
  subscribes to the inner cascade's G37 ``step_failed`` events (the
  inner step tasks inherit the contextvar-based subscriber because
  they are ``create_task``-spawned within ``process()``'s task
  context) and re-raises the inner step's REAL exception immediately
  — ``"inner workflow step 'fetch' failed (ValueError: <real
  reason>)"`` — instead of stalling until ``timeout_seconds``. So a
  degrade-loud OUTER step sees the actual reason in seconds, not an
  N-minute generic timeout. Regression:
  ``nanobrain/tests/unit/test_subworkflow_fast_fail.py``.
* Cascade timeout (inner genuinely stalled, no step raised) →
  ``TimeoutError`` (not the lenient ``status: cascade_timeout`` shape
  of ``Workflow.run`` defaults).
* Empty inner output → ``RuntimeError`` (matches the EMPTY-OUTPUT
  gate from apecx-mcp-integration's executor `7471b0a`).
* Operators opt out with ``allow_empty_inner_output: true`` per
  step config when side-effect-only inner workflows are intentional.

### Cross-domain reflection via `Workflow.from_skeleton` (2026-05-12)

When the same workflow topology (generate → critique, decompose →
solve → integrate, etc.) needs to be reused across domains with
DIFFERENT concrete step classes, the right tool is G9's typed-
bindings skeleton:

```python
from nanobrain.core.workflow import Workflow
wf = Workflow.from_skeleton(
    "path/to/reflection_skeleton.yml",
    bindings={
        "generator_class":     "my.domain.SourceGenerator",
        "generator_config":    "path/to/generator_wrapper.yml",
        "generator_input_du":  "src_input",
        "generator_output_du": "src_output",
        "critic_class":        "my.domain.SourceCritic",
        "critic_config":       "path/to/critic_wrapper.yml",
        "critic_input_du":     "critic_in",
        "critic_output_du":    "critic_verdict",
    },
)
```

The skeleton body uses `{{<hole_name>: <hole_type>}}` tokens that the
framework's lowering pipeline (G17) substitutes at load time. Each
hole's type is one of {string, integer, number, boolean, array,
object, any, tool_descriptor_ref}.

Required-vs-default + extra-binding-name validation is enforced by
`Workflow.from_skeleton` — bindings that miss a required hole OR
provide an undeclared name FAIL-FAST. Use this primitive instead of
hand-writing per-domain copies of the same topology.

### Workflow inspection: `WorkflowAnalysisStep` + `WorkflowSummarizerStep`

For "explain this workflow to a domain expert" or "is the generated
workflow structurally sound" prompts, prefer the two-step:

  1. `WorkflowAnalysisStep` (pure-Python) parses a YAML and emits a
     stable dict — workflow_name, steps[], links[], topology_summary,
     issues[]. Deterministic; safe to use as a CI pre-flight gate.
  2. `WorkflowSummarizerStep` (LLM-backed, grounded) consumes the
     analysis dict and emits Markdown with 5 required sections (What
     this workflow does / Steps / Data flow / Issues / Honest caveats).

This split matters: the analyzer's deterministic output is the
LLM summarizer's source-of-truth, so the LLM can't hallucinate
structural claims (it never sees the raw YAML).

### Self-improving workflows via git-tracked memory (2026-05-12)

The Reflexion verbal-memory loop (Shinn et al., NeurIPS 2023,
arXiv:2303.11366) is shipping as a composable pattern in apecx:

  memory_read → code_write (consumes critique) → code_review → memory_write

Use `MemoryReadStep` + `MemoryWriteStep` (apecx
`composition/steps/memory_*_step.py`) when the workflow's output
quality depends on learning from prior attempts. The memory store
is a flat directory of JSON files (one per cycle), git-tracked, so
agent-accumulated lessons surface in PR diffs.

Key gates (set in step config):

  - `MemoryReadStep.limit` — Reflexion's Ω=1–3 cap; default 3.
  - `MemoryWriteStep.min_lesson_chars` — drop low-signal lessons.
  - `MemoryWriteStep.skip_if_restatement` — keyword + lesson Jaccard
    > 0.7 vs newest entry for the same spec_id → skip.

Verified end-to-end against real Ollama
(`test_self_improvement_against_ollama.py`): 32s total for two
attempts; second attempt receives a 127-char critique formatted from
the first attempt's lesson.

### Nested-cascade pattern verified (2026-05-12)

The deterministic no-LLM reproducer
(`tests/integration/test_nested_subworkflow_reproducer.py`) PASSES
in 0.46s. Two `SubworkflowStep` instances chained at workflow level
correctly fire both inner cascades and propagate data.

**Don't** retry the "framework can't do nested cascades" myth —
it can. When you see a nested-cascade test hang, the cause is
specific to the inner-step contracts (LLM timing, data-shape
mismatch), not the framework's task-set bookkeeping.

### Picking a code-writing nested workflow (2026-05-12)

Five LLM-backed code-writing workflows ship under
`composition/workflows/code_writing/`. They are non-overlapping by
**input shape** + **verification gate** — pick by what the caller
has on hand and what proof of correctness is needed:

| Workflow | Required inputs | Gate | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `code_writing_workflow` | `code_spec` | AST + reviewer rubric | Greenfield: spec → reviewed code. |
| `code_with_tests_workflow` | `code_spec` | AST + test_code authored alongside | The caller wants both source and a smoke test in one pass. |
| `code_verification_workflow` | `code_source` + `test_code` | `IsolatedPyExecStep` subprocess result | Caller already has code; wants exec proof. |
| `code_reflection_workflow` | `code_spec` | AST + reviewer + reflection memo | Caller wants a self-critique trace alongside the code. |
| `self_improving_code_writing_workflow` | `code_spec` + `spec_id` | AST + reviewer + git-tracked memory | Recurring task where prior failures should inform the next attempt (Reflexion arXiv:2303.11366). |
| **`iterative_bug_fix_workflow`** (NW1) | `code_spec` + **`previous_attempt`** + **`critique`** (error trace) + `test_code` | `IsolatedPyExecStep` re-run on the patch | Caller has BROKEN code + failure trace; needs the FIX verified (Self-Debug arXiv:2304.05128, SWE-agent arXiv:2405.15793). |
| **`code_documentation_workflow`** (NW2) | `code_source` (bare, no docstring) | AST-equivalence at function-body level + reviewer rubric | Caller has working code; wants Google-style docstring without behavior change (DocAgent arXiv:2504.08725). |

Decision shortcut:
- Got a **spec only** → `code_writing` / `code_with_tests` /
  `code_reflection` / `self_improving` depending on how much critique
  / persistence is needed.
- Got **broken code + a trace** → `iterative_bug_fix`.
- Got **bare code, want docs** → `code_documentation`.
- Got **code + a test, want exec proof** → `code_verification`.

All six (post-NW1, NW2) are concrete `SubworkflowStep` subclasses,
manifest-listed (CW01–CW13), and each ships with a real-Ollama
integration test under `tests/integration/test_*_against_ollama.py`.

### Closed-class authoring (2026-05-12) — applies to all 3 paths

When authoring a NEW workflow (whether via hand-authored YAML,
`Workflow.from_skeleton`, or the lightweight `WorkflowBuilder`), the
rule is: **do not modify an existing library class to make your
workflow work.** If you need behavior the existing class doesn't
provide, author a NEW Python class in a NEW file and reference it
from your workflow.

Concrete consequences per path:

1. **Hand-authored YAML** — `class:` strings point at existing or
   NEW Python class paths. Never edit `composition/steps/*.py` (or
   any other shared step file) to add a parameter that only your
   workflow needs. Author `your_workflow/your_step.py` with a new
   class and point at that.

2. **`Workflow.from_skeleton`** — skeleton holes accept class paths
   via bindings. The closed-class rule applies to the binding
   targets: bind to existing classes verbatim or to NEW classes
   you authored alongside your skeleton. Never bind to a "patched
   fork" of an existing library class.

3. **Lightweight `WorkflowBuilder`** — `.add_step(name, step_cls,
   config=...)` accepts a class object. Pass the existing class as
   imported, or pass a NEW class you defined. Do not monkey-patch
   the imported class's methods before passing it; the framework
   treats the class object as a stable identity.

Why this rule is load-bearing for adoption: every existing workflow
keeps working only if shared classes stay stable. The "I'll just
edit `CodeWriteStep.process` to take one extra kwarg" path silently
breaks 6 other code-writing workflows (5 nested code-writing + 1
self-improving) and 13 manifest entries. The cost of inventing a new
class is small (one file, one YAML reference); the cost of mutating
a shared class is unbounded breakage across the consumer surface.

Pinned by `tests/unit/test_closed_class_rule_pinned_in_prompts.py`
(8 assertions, marker + remedy stem in 7 authoring-side prompts).

### Reuse-first authoring (2026-05-12) — applies to all 3 paths

Companion to closed-class. Before authoring NEW code in ANY of the
three workflow construction paths, check whether existing
capabilities already cover the task. Strict priority order:

1. **Existing library component** → cheapest. Reviewable on sight, no
   T13b sandbox gate, no novel-Python HITL review.
2. **Composition of existing components via DirectLink** → two
   library components stitched is still 100% library-grade.
3. **Existing sub-workflow step** (``CodeReflectionStep``,
   ``CodeVerificationStep``, ``CodeWithTestsStep``,
   ``SynthesisContextAssemblyStep``, etc.) → encapsulates common
   topologies so callers do not redeclare them.
4. **Existing skeleton via ``Workflow.from_skeleton``** → use when
   topology is reusable but steps differ by domain.
5. **Novel Python step** → last resort. Justify with a one-line
   rationale comment; goes through HITL + T13b.

Per-path consequences:

| Path | Reuse-first practice |
|---|---|
| Hand-authored YAML | Search the manifest before authoring a new step file. |
| `Workflow.from_skeleton` | Bind to existing classes; skeleton is the reuse vehicle. |
| `WorkflowBuilder.add_step` | Import existing step class; only define new class when no candidate fits. |

Inside a code-writing prompt context (the `CodeWriteStep` family,
not workflow composition): reuse means stdlib over hand-rolled —
`sum`/`max`/`Counter`/`itertools.groupby`/`pytest.raises` etc.
The reviewer prompt explicitly flags re-implementations.

Framework-native enforcement consumer:
`CompositionSummary.reuse_ratio` (composer_schemas.py) — derived
from `steps_reused / (steps_reused + steps_generated)`. The
`is_reuse_dominated(threshold=0.8)` predicate is the default-policy
adoption check. Used by telemetry + the composer reviewer prompt.

Pinned by `tests/unit/test_reuse_first_rule_pinned_in_prompts.py`
(9 assertions, marker + concrete-target list in 8 prompts) and
`tests/unit/test_composition_summary_reuse_ratio.py` (9 assertions
on the derived field's correctness + frozen-dataclass invariant).

### Supervisor onboarding (2026-05-12)

A new supervisor of LLM-authored apecx work should start at
`docs/supervisor_handbook.md`. The handbook covers scope (what
supervision IS / IS NOT), a day-one checklist, drift patterns
D1-D8 observed in real sessions, the rules currently shipped
(closed-class, reuse-first, plus framework-level gates), signals to
monitor, termination conditions, and the session-end distillation
policy. It is pinned by
`tests/unit/test_supervisor_handbook_pinned.py` against silent
section removal.

### Rule-authoring asymmetry (2026-05-12, CW-CO1)

When authoring an LLM-facing rule:

* The **prompt** carries imperatives + remedies only ("DO X, DO NOT Y, when X fails do Z").
* The **human-facing docs** (CLAUDE.md, this SKILL) carry rationale ("why this is non-negotiable", adoption signal).

Mixing rationale into the prompt costs tokens without changing LLM
behavior — measured 1.18 KB of "why this is non-negotiable" prose
trimmed from `system.md` (CLOSED-CLASS + REUSE-FIRST blocks) had
zero effect on T01 AC1 in a real-Ollama check.

The composer enforces a prompt-budget cap at load time via
`composer_schemas.PromptBudget` + `Composer._enforce_prompt_budgets`.
Defaults: soft cap 14 KB (warn), hard cap 16 KB (FAIL-FAST raise).
Operators override via `composer_config.yml` (`prompt_soft_cap_kb`,
`prompt_hard_cap_kb`) when shipping with a larger model. A
regression test (`tests/unit/test_prompt_budget.py::test_current_system_md_is_within_soft_cap_regression`)
fails a future PR that pushes system.md past 14 KB before merge.
