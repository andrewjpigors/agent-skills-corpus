# Perception MCP Tool Routing — The Decision Guide

59 tools across memory I/O, modules/threads/PE, memory regions, pattern/scanner/xrefs/signature, code analysis, symbol/function lookup, handles, system/environment, and the Enma scripting bridge. This skill answers "which one for this task" so the AI doesn't reach for the wrong tool. The Perception MCP server (`mcp/perception-mcp-config.json`, kept in sync with `docs/perception/mcp-api.md` by CI) exposes a wide surface where several tools overlap in capability but differ wildly in cost or precision — using `process/read_virtual_memory` for what `process/read_typed_value` does costs you a parse step; using `process/find_pattern` for what `process/scan_string` does is an order of magnitude slower; using `process/find_function_by_signature` for what `process/find_function_bounds` does costs an unnecessary AOB rescan. Routing matters.

**Always active when calling Perception MCP tools.** Before every MCP call, the question is: am I picking the cheapest tool that gives me the precision I need? This skill makes that decision tree explicit.

**Prerequisite:** `mcp/perception-mcp-config.json` is the authoritative 59-tool list and signatures. `mcp/claude-code-setup.md` covers the wiring. `mcp/cursor-setup.md` covers the Cursor variant. This skill is the *routing* layer that sits above all of those.

**Three load-bearing facts that shape every routing decision below:**

1. **Addresses + handles are HEX STRINGS** (`"0x7ff7..."`), not JSON numbers — JSON numbers lose precision past 2^53. Every `address`/`module_base`/`target_address`/`handle` param is a hex string.
2. **Handles are per-connection.** Most `process/*` tools take a `handle` as their first param (omitted from the param columns below for readability). You obtain it with `process/reference_by_pid` or `process/reference_by_name`; other connections can't use it; disconnecting releases everything; `process/dereference` releases one, `process/cleanup_references` releases all, `process/list_references` shows what you hold. A stale/cross-connection handle returns `-32002`. **Acquire a handle before any process-scoped call.**
3. **Permissions gate whole tool classes.** Toggle in Perception's *Scripting → API permissions*:
   - `kernel_rw_access` → kernel addresses in any read/write/disasm/`query_memory_region`/`find_pattern*` call, the `eprocess` field in `process/list` + `info_by_*`, the `ethread` field in `process/get_threads`, and `system/list_drivers`.
   - `write_memory` → every write tool: `process/write_virtual_memory`, `process/write_typed_value`, `process/write_string`, `process/copy_memory`, `process/fill_memory`.
   - `virtual_memory_operations` → `process/allocate_memory`, `process/free_memory`.

   A blocked call returns `-32001` naming the missing permission. Surface this in the routing advice where relevant.

## Trigger

About to call a Perception MCP tool: deciding between `process/read_virtual_memory` vs `process/read_typed_value` vs `process/read_pointer_chain`, choosing between `process/find_pattern` vs `process/scan_string` vs `process/find_string_refs`, deciding when `process/disassemble` is enough vs an iterative bounds+disasm walk, deciding whether to call a tool per-frame or cache the result, composing multiple tools into a workflow, or deciding which `script/*` call answers a scripting question.

---

## 0. Attach to the Target (handles — a prerequisite)

**Before any `process/*` call that takes a handle, you must hold one.** This is the first routing decision of every session.

```
Know the PID?            → process/reference_by_pid(pid)          → handle (hex string)
Know the image name?     → process/reference_by_name(name)        → handle (hex string)
Just want to browse?     → process/list()                          → [{pid, name, ...}]
Confirm one process?     → process/info_by_pid(pid) / info_by_name(name)
What handles do I hold?  → process/list_references()                → per-connection table
Done with one target?    → process/dereference(handle)              → releases that one
Session ending / reset?  → process/cleanup_references()             → releases all
```

`process/list` and `process/info_by_*` do **not** require a handle — they enumerate. Everything scoped to a live target (memory I/O, modules, scans, disasm) does. `system/info`, `system/list_drivers`, `script/*`, and the handle-lifecycle tools themselves take no handle.

**Why:** Skipping the reference step is the #1 first-call failure. `-32002` (stale/cross-connection handle) almost always means "I forgot to acquire one this session" or "I'm reusing a handle from a connection that disconnected."

---

## 1. "I Need to Read N Bytes at Address X"

**Decision tree, cheapest precise option first.** Every call below takes a `handle` plus the params shown.

```
Is it a typed scalar (one int / float / pointer / bool)?
  └── yes → process/read_typed_value(handle, address, type)
            type ∈ u8..u64 / i8..i64 / f32 / f64 / ptr / bool
            cheapest; one round trip; parsed for you

Is it a null-terminated / length-capped string?
  └── yes → process/read_string(handle, address, max_len?, encoding?)
            max_len default 1024; encoding ∈ auto/ascii/utf16 (auto-sniffs)
            chooses null termination over fixed length

Is it a pointer chain (deref → +offset → deref → ...)?
  └── yes → process/read_pointer_chain(handle, base_address, offsets[])
            offsets is an int array, max 64; saves N round trips

Need to know the address resolves at all before reading?
  └── yes → process/is_valid_address(handle, address)   (cheap guard)

Otherwise — a raw byte buffer (struct, blob, opcode bytes):
  └── process/read_virtual_memory(handle, address, size)
            returns bytes as hex; max 16 MiB; no parsing
```

The cost gradient (cheapest left, most expensive right):

```
process/is_valid_address < process/read_typed_value < process/read_string < process/read_pointer_chain < process/read_virtual_memory(large N)
```

**There is no server-side struct dumper.** Reading a whole struct means `process/read_virtual_memory(addr, sizeof_struct)` + client-side parse, or one `process/read_typed_value` per field. Pick by shape: a 12-byte vec3 is one `process/read_virtual_memory` (12 bytes, one trip) vs three `process/read_typed_value` calls (three trips) — take the single read when you need all the bytes; take the typed read when you need one field cheaply. If you'll re-read the same struct shape often, define it in your Enma script instead of wishing for a dumper the server doesn't provide.

`process/read_pointer_chain` is the killer feature for entity-list walks. Instead of `process/read_typed_value` × 3 (deref base, deref +offset, deref +offset), one call does all three — but the chain is capped at 64 offsets.

**Why:** Most "slow MCP" complaints reduce to picking `process/read_virtual_memory` when a typed variant would be faster, or picking three calls when `process/read_pointer_chain` would do it in one. The cost of a wrong choice is per-frame latency; the cost of the right choice is reading the doc once.

---

## 2. "I Need to Find Something in Memory"

**Different "find" tools for different inputs.** Picking the wrong one is the most common search-related mistake. All take a `handle`.

```
What are you looking for?
  ASCII string?                          → process/scan_string(text, encoding:"ascii", heap_only?)
  UTF-16LE string?                       → process/scan_string(text, encoding:"utf16", heap_only?)
                                          (no separate wide-string scanner — the encoding param picks it)
  Specific numeric value (1..8 bytes)?   → process/scan_value(type, value, aligned?, heap_only?)
                                          type ∈ u8..u64 / i8..i64 / f32 / f64; value is hex for u64/i64
  A pointer to a known address?          → process/scan_pointer_to(target_address, heap_only?)
  A code pattern (bytes + wildcards)?    → process/find_pattern(start, size, signature)        (first hit)
                                          or process/find_all_patterns(start, size, signature)   (cap 1024 hits)
  References to a function in code?      → process/find_xrefs(module_base, target_address)       (decodes .text)
  References to a known string?          → process/find_string_refs(module_base, text, encoding?, heap_only?, string_module?)
  What changed since a snapshot?         → process/scan_next(compare, value?, min?, max?)
                                          compare ∈ exact/range/unchanged/changed/increased/decreased
                                          then process/diff_memory(addr_a, addr_b, size) for byte-level diffs
  What module owns this VA?              → process/lookup_symbol(address)  (VA → module+offset+nearest export)
```

The cost gradient (cheapest first):

```
process/scan_string ~ process/scan_value < process/scan_pointer_to < process/find_pattern < process/find_xrefs < process/find_string_refs < process/scan_next(iterative) < process/diff_memory
```

Special-case observations:

- **`process/scan_string` is the one string scanner** — pass `encoding:"utf16"` for wide strings; there is no separate wide-string tool. `heap_only` defaults to the MCP UI's "Heap-only by default" toggle (on by default); pass `heap_only=false` only if you need to walk the full image.
- **`process/scan_value` with `aligned` (default true)** is the right tool for a discriminating data field — alignment narrows the hit set by 4–8×. For u64/i64, `value` is a hex string.
- **`process/scan_pointer_to` is the right tool for "find every variable that points to this object"** — aligned-QWORD scan, faster than `process/find_pattern` for an 8-byte address because alignment is known and obvious-noise patterns are excluded.
- **`process/find_pattern` takes `start` + `size` + an IDA-style signature** (`"AB CD ?? EF"`). It is for *code* sigs on a bounded region — usually a module's `.text`. For data search (string/value/pointer), the dedicated scan tools are 5–10× faster because they know the type they're hunting. Use `process/find_all_patterns` when you need every hit (cap 1024).
- **`process/find_string_refs` does the cross-reference walk for you**: pass a string literal, get back every instruction that loads it via `LEA`/`MOV [rip+...]`. Phase 1 (string search) is **pre-capped at 1 GiB** — if the cap fires, the call errors and asks you to pass `heap_only=true` or set `string_module` (hex VA of the module that owns the string, usually the same as `module_base`) for a fast bounded scan. Phase 2 caps code hits at 4096 and sets a `truncated` flag. The combo `scan the label → find_string_refs → disassemble the call site` is the canonical "find the function that owns this UI element" workflow.
- **The cheat-engine workflow is `process/scan_next` + `process/diff_memory`, not a whole-process snapshot.** There is no tool that snapshots the entire process. `process/scan_next(compare:"changed")` narrows the value-type hits you've accumulated across scans; `process/diff_memory(addr_a, addr_b, size)` gives byte-level before/after on a region you choose (cap 1 MiB). Decide the region up front — there is no global diff.

**Why:** `process/find_pattern` is the tool every new user reaches for because it sounds the most general. It's actually the most *specialized* — it scans a bounded region for a byte pattern. For data search (string, value, pointer), the dedicated scan tools are faster because they know the type they're hunting for. And the "what changed" workflow is `scan_next` (typed narrowing) + `diff_memory` (region diff), not a magic snapshot tool.

---

## 3. "I Need to Understand This Function"

**Cost-tiered: just see the asm vs walk bounds vs AOB-rescan. Pick the depth you actually need.** All take a `handle`.

```
Just want the disassembly of a few instructions?
  → process/disassemble(handle, address, max_bytes?, max_instructions?)
    Zydis; defaults 256 bytes / 32 insns; cheap; bytes → asm

Need start/end of the function containing addr?
  → process/find_function_bounds(handle, address, scan_back?, scan_forward?)
    heuristic; defaults 4096 back / 65536 forward; returns [start, end]
    for precision, use process/get_exception_table(module_base) — .pdata RUNTIME_FUNCTION entries are exact

Need to find a function by an AOB sig across a module?
  → process/find_function_by_signature(handle, module_base, signature)
    AOB-scans .text + runs bounds walk on each hit; more expensive than a single bounds call

Want to know what function lives at a VA / which module owns it?
  → process/lookup_symbol(handle, address)
    VA → {module_base, module_name, module_offset, section, nearest_export}
  → process/find_function_by_name(handle, pattern, case_sensitive?, max_results?)
    substring match across all modules' export tables; default case-insensitive, 64 results
```

There is **no function-analyzer tool** and **no call-graph builder**. For "what does this function call," `process/disassemble` the body and read the `CALL`/`JMP` targets yourself (iterate `process/find_xrefs` if you need incoming callers). For "what value is in RCX at this instruction," there is **no register-tracer** — `process/disassemble` the surrounding instructions and reason about the register set (a `MOV RCX, [rip+x]` tells you the source; a `LEA RCX, [...]` likewise). State the limitation honestly: the MCP gives you bytes and disassembly; register-dataflow analysis is the client's job.

The standard composition:

```
process/find_pattern(start, size, sig)        → addr
process/find_function_bounds(handle, addr)    → [start, end]
process/disassemble(handle, start, end-start) → asm
process/lookup_symbol(handle, call_target)    → which export each CALL hits
```

This is the four-step "what does this code path do?" workflow that replaces an IDA session for most questions. For precise bounds (stripped binaries, no heuristics), swap `process/find_function_bounds` for `process/get_exception_table(module_base)` and look up the RUNTIME_FUNCTION covering `addr`.

**Why:** `process/find_function_by_signature` is the expensive one here — it AOB-scans a whole module's `.text` and bounds-walks every hit. Calling it when `process/disassemble` of a known address would do is multi-second latency vs millisecond latency. The cost isn't visible until you wire one into a per-frame path.

---

## 4. "I Need to Understand This Class / VTable"

**Two tools, often used together.** Both take a `handle`.

```
Want the vtable function-pointer layout?
  → process/analyze_vtable(handle, vtable_address, max_entries?)
    default 64 entries; classifies each as code/data per loaded modules

Want the RTTI class name + parent chain?
  → process/read_rtti(handle, vtable_address)
    Win64 RTTI: class name string + base-class hierarchy
```

The combo gives you a full picture of "what is this object?" — start with `process/read_rtti` to know the class, then `process/analyze_vtable` to get the methods. Together they replace a Class Informer / Class Explorer pass in IDA. Note both take the **vtable address**, not the object address — deref the object to its vtable first (`process/read_typed_value(obj, "ptr")`).

Caveat: RTTI is only present in binaries compiled with `/GR` (MSVC) or `-frtti` (GCC/Clang). Stripped binaries return nothing useful from `process/read_rtti`. In that case, the vtable layout is your only handle on the class identity — name your `VTable_<addr>` yourself. For deeper PE truth (sections, exports, data dirs), see section 6.

**Why:** Class identification is half the battle in any C++ game RE. `process/read_rtti` answers "what is this?" in one call when it works; falling back to vtable layout matching is the alternative. Routing here is binary: try RTTI first, fall back to vtable analysis.

---

## 5. "I Need a Sig for This Address"

**`process/generate_signature(handle, address, max_length?)`** produces an IDA-style sig from the instruction at `addr`, wildcarding relocatable bytes (RIP-relative displacements, call targets). `max_length` defaults 32; the response carries `is_unique=false` if the length is exhausted without uniqueness.

Pair immediately with `tools/sig-uniqueness-checker.py` (added in this branch) to validate:

```
1. process/generate_signature(handle, addr, 16)  → "48 8D 0D ?? ?? ?? ?? E8"
2. write to a temp file, then:
3. python3 tools/sig-uniqueness-checker.py game.exe --sig "..."
4. read the verdict:
   - UNIQUE margin=5    → ship it
   - AMBIGUOUS, N hits  → regenerate with longer max_length
   - STALE              → the sig doesn't match at the expected address (very rare; investigate)
   - BRITTLE margin=0   → regenerate longer
```

`max_length` is a starting point; iterate with `process/generate_signature(handle, addr, 24)` if the 16-byte version is ambiguous. Each generation is cheap; the validation step is also cheap. Iterate until UNIQUE with `margin ≥ 2` and add the sig to your `offsets.em` with an `// E-NNN` evidence reference (per `skill://re-evidence-log`).

To *use* a sig to find a function in a module you haven't attached to by address, `process/find_function_by_signature(handle, module_base, signature)` AOB-scans `.text` and bounds-walks each hit — heavier than a plain `process/find_pattern`, but it returns function bounds, not just a hit address.

**Why:** The MCP can generate sigs but cannot validate them; the local Python tool can validate sigs but cannot generate them from a live address. The combination is the workflow.

---

## 6. "I Need to Know About the Process / Modules"

**Process, module, thread, and PE enumeration tools.** All cheap and safe to call at session start. The handle-less ones (`process/list`, `process/info_by_*`) come first; the rest take a `handle`.

```
What processes are running?                   → process/list()                                 (no handle)
One process by PID / by image name?           → process/info_by_pid(pid) / info_by_name(name)  (no handle)
All loaded modules in the target?             → process/get_modules(handle)
All threads?                                  → process/get_threads(handle)                   (ethread gated kernel_rw_access)
One module by name?                           → process/get_module_by_name(handle, name)
PE sections of a module?                      → process/get_module_sections(handle, module_base)
NT/optional header summary?                   → process/get_pe_header(handle, module_base)
One PE data directory?                        → process/get_data_directory(handle, module_base, directory)
                                              directory ∈ export/import/resource/exception/.../com_descriptor or 0..15
Full EAT walk?                                → process/list_module_exports(handle, module_base)
Single export resolve?                        → process/get_export_address(handle, module_base, export_name)
Full IAT walk?                                → process/get_module_imports(handle, module_base)
Single IAT slot VA?                           → process/get_import_address(handle, module_base, import_name)
All strings in a module image?                → process/get_module_strings(handle, module_base, min_length?, encoding?)
                                              min_length default 4; encoding ∈ ascii/utf16/both
Precise function bounds from .pdata?          → process/get_exception_table(handle, module_base, max_entries?)
Target's command line (PEB)?                 → process/get_command_line(handle)               (x64 only)
Target's environment block (PEB)?             → process/list_environment(handle, max_bytes?)  → [{key, value}]
System-wide handle table?                    → process/enum_handles(max_entries?)            (no handle; default 8192)
Build / page size / arch for keyed offsets?  → system/info()                                  (no handle; is_24h2_or_later flag)
Kernel modules?                              → system/list_drivers(max_entries?)             (no handle; gated kernel_rw_access)
```

`process/enum_handles`, `system/info`, and `system/list_drivers` take **no handle** — they query the system, not a referenced process.

For deeper cross-module analysis (which other modules import a specific export from this one), pair with `tools/module-export-mapper.py --consumers <dir>` (added in this branch). The MCP gives you exports + imports per module; the Python tool joins them into a "this DLL is consumed by ..." map.

`process/get_modules` is the right call when attaching: it returns the module list including base addresses + sizes, which is what you need for `process/find_pattern` calls bounded to a specific module. Don't iterate `process/list` + `process/list_module_exports` per module yourself — `process/get_modules` returns the full picture in one call.

**Why:** These tools are cheap and idempotent; the routing is mostly "use them rather than guessing." The only mistake is overusing `process/list` in a loop — it snapshots the system every call. Call it once; cache the result. And remember `system/info`'s `is_24h2_or_later` flag for build-keyed offsets — query it once per session, not per call.

---

## 7. Scripting Bridge (Enma)

**The Enma scripting bridge is three tools, none of which takes a `handle`.** They run a script (or return reference text) with their own permissions, independent of any referenced process. The bridge is exactly these three — there are no MCP tools for host file I/O, host text search, host reference finding, internet search, or duplicate script-lifecycle aliases. File reads/writes are NOT MCP tools; do them via the toolkit's standalone Python tools or the Perception IDE.

```
Need the Enma language + Perception API reference?
  → script/get_context()
    Returns the full reference as one context string. CALL ONCE PER SESSION
    before generating any script — enma is proprietary and its addon surface
    can't be inferred from training data. Covers language grammar, all 17
    pre-shipped enma addons, and all 12 Perception API surfaces.

Syntax + type check only (no run)?
  → script/validate(source)
    Compile-only. ALL addons registered (render/proc/cpu/zydis/sound/win/
    unicorn/net/input/gui/thread/filesystem). Returns { ok, errors:[] }.
    Cheap; safe to run on every save.

Actually run the script?
  → script/execute(source)
    Compile + run main() once. Returns { ok, logs:[] }.
    GUI and thread addons are NOT registered here — those resources would
    outlive a one-shot script and leak. For long-lived scripts with GUI/
    threads, use the in-app script editor, not script/execute.
```

The validate→execute ladder:

- `script/get_context` first, once per session — load the reference so you emit valid enma.
- `script/validate` on every edit — compile-only, all addons registered, catches syntax + type errors. This is the only compile-check; there is no second script-lifecycle alias.
- `script/execute` only when you actually want to run it — has side effects, and **cannot** register GUI/thread addons.

**Why:** Mixing up `script/validate` and `script/execute` is the new-user mistake — running the script when you only wanted to check syntax. And assuming `script/execute` can spawn a GUI is the second mistake — it can't, by design. The progression reference → validate → execute is the right ladder; climb only as far as the question demands.

## 8. Cost Tiers — What's Expensive, What's Cheap

**Internalize these tiers. Cheap tools are fine in tight loops; expensive ones must be cached or called outside hot paths.** Latency feel is qualitative; the hard limits are the numbers that bite.

| Tier | Tools | Hard limits / notes | Latency feel |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cheap** (sub-ms to few ms) | `process/list`, `process/info_by_pid`, `process/info_by_name`, `process/get_modules`, `process/get_module_by_name`, `process/get_threads`, `process/get_module_sections`, `process/get_pe_header`, `process/get_data_directory`, `process/get_export_address`, `process/get_import_address`, `process/is_valid_address`, `process/read_typed_value`, `process/read_string`, `process/read_pointer_chain` (≤64 offsets), `process/disassemble` (1–2 insns, default 256 B / 32 insns), `process/find_function_bounds`, `process/read_rtti`, `process/lookup_symbol`, `process/find_function_by_name` (default 64 results), `process/query_memory_region`, `process/get_command_line`, `process/list_environment`, `system/info`, `process/enum_handles` (default 8192) | First three + `system/info` + `enum_handles` take no handle. | Safe per-call when you need them |
| **Medium** (1–100 ms) | `process/scan_string`, `process/scan_value`, `process/scan_pointer_to`, `process/scan_next`, `process/find_pattern`, `process/find_all_patterns` (cap 1024 hits), `process/analyze_vtable` (default 64 entries), `process/find_xrefs`, `process/generate_signature`, `process/read_virtual_memory` (≤16 MiB), `process/copy_memory` (≤64 MiB in 1 MiB chunks), `process/list_module_exports`, `process/get_module_imports`, `process/get_module_strings`, `process/get_exception_table` | `heap_only` defaults to the UI toggle (on) for the scanners — flipping it off walks full user-space and can OOM on multi-GiB heaps. | Cache results; never call per-frame |
| **Expensive** (100 ms–10 s) | `process/find_string_refs` (phase 1 pre-capped 1 GiB; phase 2 caps code hits 4096), `process/find_function_by_signature` (module-wide AOB + bounds walk per hit), `process/diff_memory` (cap 1 MiB), `process/allocate_memory` (≤256 MiB), `process/enumerate_memory_regions` (full VAD walk), `system/list_drivers` (gated `kernel_rw_access`), `script/get_context` (returns the whole reference) | `find_string_refs` errors if the 1 GiB cap fires — pass `heap_only=true` or set `string_module`. | Manual workflow tools; never automated into hot paths |
| **Side-effecting** (permission-gated) | `process/write_virtual_memory`, `process/write_typed_value`, `process/write_string`, `process/copy_memory`, `process/fill_memory` (all gated `write_memory`); `process/allocate_memory`, `process/free_memory` (gated `virtual_memory_operations`); `process/dereference`, `process/cleanup_references` (release handles); `script/execute` (runs `main()`, no GUI/thread addons) | Blocked calls return `-32001` naming the missing permission. | Ask before doing; never in a render loop |

The pattern in PCX scripts: call medium-tier tools in `main()` (one-shot setup), cache results into globals, then in `on_update` / `on_render` only call cheap tools. The 12-rule discipline (`game-cheat-guidelines` rule #4: separate update from render; `skill://pcx-perf-budget` Step 5: cache expensive, recompute cheap) is the same principle applied to MCP calls.

**Why:** The MCP latency budget is shared with the rest of your frame. A 5 ms `process/find_pattern` in `on_render` at 144 Hz eats 72% of the frame. Tier awareness is what keeps the script smooth.

## 9. Composition Patterns — Tools That Compose Well

**The standard combos. Each is a multi-call workflow reused across most RE sessions.** Every `process/*` call here implicitly takes a `handle` acquired in section 0.

| Goal | Composition |
|---|---|
| "Attach to the target" | `process/list` → `process/reference_by_name(name)` → `process/get_modules` (cache bases+sizes) → `process/cleanup_references` on shutdown |
| "Find the function that handles a UI label" | `process/scan_string(text, encoding:"utf16")` → `process/find_string_refs(module_base, text)` → `process/disassemble(call_addr)` → `process/lookup_symbol(call_target)` |
| "Find a global pointer behind a LEA" | `process/find_pattern(start, size, sig)` → `process/disassemble(hit, max_instructions:1)` (confirm `LEA reg, [rip+x]`) → `process/read_typed_value(resolved, "ptr")` |
| "What are the args passed to this call?" | `process/disassemble(call_site, max_instructions:8)` (read the `MOV RCX/RDX/R8/R9` and `LEA` insns before the `CALL`) → reason about the register set client-side. No register-tracer exists. |
| "Map an entity struct" | `process/read_pointer_chain(base, [0, 0])` → `process/read_rtti(vtable_addr)` → `process/analyze_vtable(vtable_addr)` → `process/read_virtual_memory(entity, sizeof)` + client parse (no server-side struct dumper) |
| "Precise function bounds (stripped binary)" | `process/get_module_by_name(name)` → `process/get_exception_table(module_base)` → look up the RUNTIME_FUNCTION covering `addr` (fallback to `process/find_function_bounds` if no .pdata) |
| "Snapshot, perform action, diff" | `process/scan_value(type, value)` (baseline hits) → user does in-game action → `process/scan_next(compare:"changed")` (narrow) → `process/diff_memory(addr_a, addr_b, size)` for byte-level before/after on a chosen region (cap 1 MiB). No whole-process snapshot tool. |
| "Sig + validate" | `process/generate_signature(addr, 16)` → save → `python3 tools/sig-uniqueness-checker.py game.exe --sig "..."` → if margin < 2, regenerate longer |
| "Sig → function in a new build" | `process/get_module_by_name(name)` → `process/find_function_by_signature(module_base, sig)` → if STALE, broaden the sig and retry |
| "Which module owns this VA?" | `process/lookup_symbol(address)` → `{module_base, module_name, module_offset, section, nearest_export}` |
| "Write a one-shot Enma script" | `script/get_context` (once) → `script/validate(source)` (compile-only, all addons) → `script/execute(source)` (run `main()` once; no GUI/thread addons) |
| "Per-binary diff after patch" | `python3 tools/offset-diff.py --old V1 --new V2 --sigs old_offsets_json` → for each LOST: `process/find_pattern` against V2 with broadened sig → record new sig |

These compose without ceremony — each call's output is the next call's input. The AI should *reach for the composition* rather than asking "should I call N more tools?" — the workflow is the unit, not the individual call.

**Why:** Naming the compositions makes them habits. Without a name, every new user re-derives the workflow from scratch and asks each tool call as a separate question. Named compositions become muscle memory after a handful of uses.
