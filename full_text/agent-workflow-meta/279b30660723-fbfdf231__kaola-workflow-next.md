## Codex Profile Freshness Gate

On every entry or resume into this skill, before any role probe, retry, re-plan,
or real dispatch, run the normal preflight gate, not `--doctor`. Resolve exactly
one enabled installed Kaola edition from `codex plugin list --json`, then execute
the bundled `kaola-workflow-codex-preflight.js` from that edition's exact
marketplace/name/version cache tuple.
Never search `$PWD/plugins` or select the lexically first cache entry:

```bash
if ! KAOLA_CODEX_PLUGIN_LIST_OUT="$(codex plugin list --json 2>&1)"; then
  printf 'profile_preflight_refused: plugin metadata unavailable: %s\n' "$KAOLA_CODEX_PLUGIN_LIST_OUT" >&2
  exit 1
fi
if ! KAOLA_CODEX_PLUGIN_META="$(node -e '
const value=JSON.parse(process.argv[1]);
const allowed=new Set(["kaola-workflow","kaola-workflow-gitlab","kaola-workflow-gitea"]);
const rows=(Array.isArray(value.installed)?value.installed:[]).filter(row => row && row.installed === true && row.enabled === true && allowed.has(row.name));
if(rows.length!==1)throw new Error(`expected exactly one enabled installed Kaola edition; got ${rows.length}`);
const row=rows[0];
for(const [label,item] of [["marketplace",row.marketplaceName],["name",row.name],["version",row.version]])if(typeof item!=="string"||item==="."||item===".."||!/^[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$/.test(item))throw new Error(`unsafe ${label}`);
if(row.pluginId!==`${row.name}@${row.marketplaceName}`)throw new Error("plugin identity mismatch");
process.stdout.write([row.marketplaceName,row.name,row.version].join("\t"));
' "$KAOLA_CODEX_PLUGIN_LIST_OUT" 2>&1)"; then
  printf 'profile_preflight_refused: invalid plugin metadata: %s\n' "$KAOLA_CODEX_PLUGIN_META" >&2

  exit 1
fi
if [ "$KAOLA_CODEX_PREFLIGHT_STATUS" != ok ]; then
  printf 'profile_preflight_refused: %s\n' "$KAOLA_CODEX_PREFLIGHT_OUT" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

The exact active cache root is
`$HOME/.codex/plugins/cache/$KAOLA_CODEX_MARKETPLACE/$KAOLA_CODEX_PLUGIN_NAME/$KAOLA_CODEX_PLUGIN_VERSION`.
The base invocation is `--project-root "$PWD" --no-autofix --json`; the gate
merges persisted config from HOME through the repository root to `"$PWD"`. When this
skill owns a frozen adaptive plan, set `KAOLA_CODEX_PREFLIGHT_PLAN` to that
exact plan before running the block so `--plan` is also enforced. Continue only
after exit 0 and parsed `status: "ok"`. Exact-byte drift such as
`profile_bytes_mismatch` is `profile_preflight_refused`: STOP before any
`agents.spawn_agent` call, never record `subagent-invoked`, and do not relabel
profile/config drift as tool unavailability or local fallback. Re-run the gate if the installed profile set changes.

# Kaola-Workflow Next

**First Principles.** When no shipped rule, gate, or refusal already settles a
situation, break the tie by the First Principles axioms (the `## First Principles`
block in your project's workflow-init CLAUDE.md), applied in priority order, and
record a one-line derivation in the node's `.cache` evidence — OPTIONAL, never
blocks a gate. An axiom may only make you stricter:
never cite one to skip a typed gate, refusal, or barrier.

## In-progress re-plan control plane

<!-- PIN: replan-next -->

This fence outranks every normal startup, mirror, scheduler, handoff, validation, and
finalization route. Before any such action, read the project state and transaction status. When
either reports `replan_in_progress`, do not mutate or replace the frozen parent
`workflow-plan.md`. Read-only orientation must report the exact `replan_phase`,
`transaction_id`, `parent_plan_hash`, `child_plan_hash` (or `none`), and
`last_cas_result`; never reconstruct them from memory.

The single legal mutation while the fence is active is the edition-local re-plan resume command:

```bash
REPLAN_SCRIPT="./plugins/kaola-workflow-gitlab/scripts/kaola-gitlab-workflow-replan.js"
if [ ! -f "$REPLAN_SCRIPT" ]; then
  REPLAN_SCRIPT="$(find "$HOME/.codex/plugins/cache" -path '*/kaola-workflow-gitlab/*/scripts/kaola-gitlab-workflow-replan.js' -print -quit 2>/dev/null)"
fi
[ -n "$REPLAN_SCRIPT" ] && [ -f "$REPLAN_SCRIPT" ] || { echo "BLOCKED: kaola-gitlab-workflow-replan.js unavailable" >&2; exit 1; }
node "$REPLAN_SCRIPT" resume --project {project} --json
```

The installed aggregator is `kaola-gitlab-workflow-replan.js`. Do not run mirror/open/record/close/run-chains,
ordinary adaptive handoff, claim archive, task-mirror refresh, or finalize while an intermediate
phase remains. `decision:ask` remains advisory and never adds a pause or gate.

If resume returns `replan_planner_dispatch_required`, dispatch the genuine
`workflow-planner` profile in its Re-plan dispatch mode with an isolated brief containing only
the repository root, project, `transaction_id`, `dispatch_nonce`, profile identity, the exact
`.cache/replan-planner-packet.json` path, and the packet's reason/source evidence. No role
sequence, node ids, dependencies, write sets, cardinality, shape, model, or exact DAG fragment may
be supplied by the orchestrator; an attempt earns `planner_control_boundary_violation`. The
planner alone writes the seeded `workflow-plan.next.md` and
`.cache/replan-planner-attestation.json`, then returns through this same resume command. Missing,
stale, replayed, or mismatched dispatch proof/attestation is
`replan_planner_attestation_invalid`; main must never synthesize either artifact.

An invalid unfrozen child uses the bounded unfrozen child-repair loop: re-dispatch the same planner
with the verbatim validator errors and its own child draft, then resume. The main session never
repairs the child DAG. At the retry bound, stop with the typed evidence; do not create a competing
plan, restart the claim, or route to another path. A verified legacy-v1 parent follows this same
transaction into a schema-2 child; legacy normal startup behavior otherwise stays unchanged.

This is the thin router. It owns startup checks, roadmap freshness, active project selection, state repair, and phase routing. It does not perform phase work directly unless it routes into the next skill.

## Goal Contract

Continue until the selected workflow phase objective is satisfied, evidence is
recorded, and `workflow-state.md` points to the correct `next_skill`. Do not
stop after routine substeps. Stop only for true external authorization,
destructive or risky Git operations, materially user-owned choices, or ambiguity
that blocks correctness.

## Autonomy Policy

Treat nonessential workflow bookkeeping as autonomous: generated project names,
collision suffixes such as `-2`, cache/artifact paths, and harmless ordering
choices are selected automatically and recorded. For essential technical
decisions, consult the strongest available expert model/profile for the session,
apply the chosen answer directly, and record it under `.cache/` or the phase
artifact.

## Run-Gap Capture (Goal Completion Rule)

**Finishing an issue INCLUDES capturing its run-discovered defects.** A run that
surfaces a defect — a reviewer finding deferred to follow-up, an in-run
repair/reopen, a deferred or waived chain, a flake — is not "done" until each
such gap is either FILED as a follow-up issue (recorded `filed: #N` in
`finalization-summary.md`'s `## Run gaps` section) or explicitly justified as
`noise: <reason>`. Filing the follow-up SATISFIES the goal; silently deferring a
known defect without filing or justifying it VIOLATES the goal, and the
`gaps_unswept` finalize gate will refuse. "Loop until criteria pass" includes
this capture step. Use the forge's issue tracker to file follow-ups.

## Delegation Contract

Codex subagent delegation is the default. The session delegation policy defaults to `delegate` and is established without prompting the user; the workflow complies with its delegated-role contract automatically rather than asking the user to choose.

**Skip this step if `delegation_policy:` is already set in `workflow-state.md`.**

The default `delegation_policy` is `delegate`: invoke the Codex subagent roles (code-explorer, planner, code-architect, tdd-guide, code-reviewer, security-reviewer, doc-updater) for delegated work and record `subagent-invoked` in each compliance ledger. Do not ask the user to choose a delegation policy.

Tool availability is auto-detected, not a user choice. The Codex Profile Freshness Gate above is authoritative for profile/config availability: it validates a higher-precedence project Kaola override before accepting a fresh global install. Missing, stale, malformed, or shadowed profiles are `profile_preflight_refused`: STOP before phase work and never record them as a local fallback. Only after a successful gate may a genuinely unavailable runtime agent tool or a model-refused spawn count as tool unavailability. In that case keep `delegation_policy: delegate` and, for each affected Codex role row, record `local-fallback-tool-unavailable` with non-empty runtime evidence. An empty Evidence cell fails the repair-state cross-check, so always write the evidence. Never present tool-unavailability as a question.

For every affected row, record `local-fallback-tool-unavailable` with a non-empty Evidence value.

The profile detection paths are the project override at `.codex/agents/kaola-workflow/` and the global default at `~/.codex/agents/kaola-workflow/`; only the precedence/trust-aware freshness gate decides which one is active.

Set `delegation_policy: local-authorized` (recording `local-fallback-explicit` in each Codex role row) only when the user explicitly asks to disable delegation or authorizes an inline local fallback. Do not select `local-authorized` on your own initiative.

**Write order** — three steps, in sequence:

1. Set `KAOLA_DELEGATION_POLICY=delegate` without asking; use `local-authorized` only on the user's explicit request to disable delegation.
2. Call the startup script (this creates `workflow-state.md`).
3. After startup succeeds and `workflow-state.md` exists, patch the delegation policy into the file:

```bash
printf '\ndelegation_policy: %s\n' "$KAOLA_DELEGATION_POLICY" >> "kaola-workflow/${KAOLA_PROJECT}/workflow-state.md"
```

Where `KAOLA_DELEGATION_POLICY` is `delegate` by default and `local-authorized` only on the user's explicit request to disable delegation. `tool-unavailable` remains a valid `delegation_policy:` value for legacy state, but new runs detect tool absence as per-row `local-fallback-tool-unavailable` evidence under `delegate` rather than choosing it at startup.

Do not re-ask during the session. Re-establish the default only if `workflow-state.md` is absent.

## Agent Issue Selection (Required Before Startup)

Before calling the startup script, the agent must select a target issue. Scripts
do not auto-pick; the agent owns this decision.

**Branch first on whether the user named an issue:**

- **User named a specific issue** — `$ARGUMENTS` carries an issue number/project, or
  the prompt names one → use the single-issue selection (steps below), byte-unchanged.
- **User did NOT name an issue** — the common "work on the next issue" / no-argument
  case → this is the **auto-bundle entry**. Resolve the path intent first
  (Startup Step 0a-1), then dispatch the read-only **`issue-scout`** agent role
  (*Auto-bundle entry* below) and adopt its recommendation: set `KAOLA_TARGET_ISSUES`
  for a high-confidence same-scope bundle **when the resolved path is adaptive**,
  otherwise set `KAOLA_TARGET_ISSUE` to the scout's `primary_issue`. STATE the selected
  set aloud, then continue to validation and startup. (Dispatching the read-only scout
  here is permitted — it is a pre-claim survey, not a phase agent role.)

On the no-issue-named branch, **`issue-scout` is the SOLE backlog reader** — the
router does NOT re-scan the backlog. The scout already reads `ROADMAP.md`, the forge
issue list, active folders, and archived summaries (its *Backlog Inventory* / *What You
May Read*); the router only ADOPTS the scout's recommendation, then validates + claims
it. Do not duplicate the scan here.

1. If exactly one active folder is already present, read its issue number from `node "$claim_script" status` (`active[0].issue_number`) and set `KAOLA_TARGET_ISSUE` to that value before calling startup. The script will return `verdict: owned`; proceed to routing. Do not skip the startup call.

   ```bash
   claim_script="plugins/kaola-workflow-gitlab/scripts/kaola-gitlab-workflow-claim.js"
   if [ ! -f "$claim_script" ]; then
     claim_script="$(find "$HOME/.codex/plugins/cache" -path '*/kaola-workflow-gitlab/*/scripts/kaola-gitlab-workflow-claim.js' -print -quit 2>/dev/null)"
   fi
   STATUS_OUT="$(node "$claim_script" status 2>/dev/null)"
   KAOLA_TARGET_ISSUE="$(node -e "try{const j=JSON.parse(process.argv[1]);process.stdout.write(j.count===1?String(j.active[0].issue_number):'')}catch(e){}" "$STATUS_OUT")"
   ```
2. Validate the target exists before calling startup. Validate against the active consumer repository, not against the Kaola-Workflow package repository unless that is the active project.
   - Online: `glab issue view "$KAOLA_TARGET_ISSUE" --output json` against the active project. If the fetch fails, stop and ask — do not fall back to a different issue.
   - Offline (`KAOLA_WORKFLOW_OFFLINE=1`): require `kaola-workflow/.roadmap/issue-$KAOLA_TARGET_ISSUE.md` to exist in the cwd's repo, OR an active folder whose `issue_number` matches the target. If neither is present, stop and ask the user to confirm the issue or run online.
3. State the selected issue number before calling startup.

Set `KAOLA_TARGET_ISSUE` to the chosen issue number before calling startup.

## Agent Issue Selection — Bundle Lane (Multi-Issue)

The bundle lane is additive: `KAOLA_TARGET_ISSUE` / `--target-issue N` single-issue
behavior is unchanged. Use the bundle lane only when the user explicitly names
several issues or when auto-bundle mode identifies a high-confidence same-scope set
(see below).

### Explicit-bundle entry

When the user names several issues together (e.g., "finish issues #N #N #N
together"), route through the bundle lane:

- Set `KAOLA_TARGET_ISSUES=42,47,53` (comma-separated, no spaces) before calling startup.
- The startup script validates the exact set — it does NOT substitute or reorder issues.
- Project name and active folder: `bundle-42-47-53` (sorted ascending, deduplicated).
- Branch: `workflow/bundle-42-47-53`.
- Bundle lane is **adaptive-path only** (`workflow_path: adaptive` is required). A
  bundle request with an explicit `KAOLA_PATH=fast`/`full` is refused with
  `bundle_requires_adaptive`; do not silently downgrade to a single issue.
- In the startup call, pass `--target-issues 42,47,53` (instead of `--target-issue N`)
  and `--workflow-path adaptive`.

Compatibility rule: `KAOLA_TARGET_ISSUE` / `--target-issue` keep current one-issue
behavior UNCHANGED. `KAOLA_TARGET_ISSUES` / `--target-issues` are the ONLY
multi-issue startup path. If BOTH are set, the script refuses with
`target_ambiguity`; never set both.

### Auto-bundle entry

This is the **no-issue-named branch of Agent Issue Selection**: whenever the user
does not name a specific issue — including the everyday "work on the next issue" entry —
dispatch the read-only **`issue-scout`** agent role to inspect the backlog before
claiming anything. The scout is the SOLE backlog reader; it surveys the sources listed in
its own *What You May Read* (roadmap sources, remote open issues + dependency labels,
active folders, archived summaries) — the router does not re-list or re-scan them here.

It returns one recommended same-scope bundle **plus a `primary_issue` and a `confidence`**
(or no bundle). **The main orchestrator STATES the selected issue set aloud before calling
startup.** Scripts validate but never select or substitute issues.

issue-scout is read-only: it cannot claim issues, write repository files, author
`workflow-plan.md`, close issues, or dispatch other agents.

On Codex v2, use the direct `agents.spawn_agent` tool for issue-scout; never use the server-reserved
`collaboration.spawn_agent` name and never dispatch through `functions.exec` or Code Mode. If preflight reports
`codex_v2_encrypted_transport_unsafe` or `codex_v2_role_transport_unsafe`, refuse before the scout
spawn. Do not retry an encrypted-output decode or reserved-schema failure and do not fall back to a
default role: the same transport/schema mismatch will fail deterministically again.

Use this literal v2 argument shape (with the repository and request values filled in); omit transient
`model` and `reasoning_effort` fields:

```yaml
agents.spawn_agent:
  task_name: "issue_scout"
  agent_type: "issue-scout"
  fork_turns: "none"
  message: "Repository root: <absolute-root>. Selected issue/set request: <request>. Apply the issue-scout skill/profile read-only contract. Return only the bounded durable recommendation JSON required below."
```

This is an isolated, self-contained control-plane brief: it includes repository root, selected
issue/set/project context, the required skill/profile contract, and the expected durable return.
Codex v1 likewise uses `fork_turns: "none"` and preserves the established identity/header convention.
No control-plane dispatch uses `fork_turns: "all"`.

The rejection `Full-history forked agents inherit the parent agent type, model, and reasoning effort; omit agent_type, model, and reasoning_effort, or spawn without a full-history fork.` is an
**argument-shape refusal**, not capacity or unavailable tooling. Correct the arguments to the literal
shape above and retry the same issue-scout role, task identity, isolated brief, and bounded durable
return exactly once. Never select issues inline. Reserve `local-fallback-tool-unavailable` for agent
tooling that is genuinely unavailable.

**Ordering — resolve the path BEFORE consuming a bundle:** the bundle lane is
adaptive-only, so resolve the path intent (Startup Step 0a-1) *before*
acting on the scout's recommendation. Pursue a bundle ONLY when the resolved path is
`adaptive`; with an explicit `KAOLA_PATH=fast`/`full` take only the scout's
`primary_issue` (a bundle there is refused at startup with `bundle_requires_adaptive`).

**Output → env wiring:** map the scout's recommendation into the startup env exactly:
- high-confidence same-scope bundle AND resolved path adaptive → set `KAOLA_TARGET_ISSUES`
  from `recommended_bundle.issues` (e.g. `KAOLA_TARGET_ISSUES=42,47,53`);
- otherwise (single-issue recommendation, `confidence: medium`/`low`, or non-adaptive path)
  → set `KAOLA_TARGET_ISSUE` to the scout's `primary_issue`. Never set both (`target_ambiguity`).

**Selection Evidence Docking.** On this no-issue-named branch, once the target project's active
folder exists — after claim completes (the Startup transaction for `fast`/`full`, or the adaptive
front end's claim inside `kaola-workflow-adapt`), before dispatching the executor — persist the
issue-scout's ENTIRE JSON reply verbatim, fenced, to
`kaola-workflow/{project}/.cache/selection-evidence.md`, prefixed with a one-line header
`selection_mode: auto-bundle` (bundle recommendation adopted) or `selection_mode: single-issue`
(the scout fell back to a single `primary_issue`). This durable selection evidence archives
automatically with the project when the run finalizes. Skip this step entirely on the
user-named-issue branch — a user-named claim legitimately has no selection evidence.

Auto-bundle mode emits a bundle only when:
- all candidate issues are open and unclaimed;
- no dependency is unresolved outside the bundle;
- the issues share a coherent scope signal (same subsystem, same label, same
  failing area, or an explicit dependency relation);
- issue count is at or below `KAOLA_BUNDLE_MAX_ISSUES` (default 4).

**Fallback rule:** when no high-confidence same-scope bundle exists, the scout
returns a single `primary_issue` (or `confidence: low`) → fall back to single-issue
selection via `KAOLA_TARGET_ISSUE`. Do not manufacture a bundle.

### Bundle closure

A bundle run ends at ONE finalization that closes EVERY issue in the set
(all-or-nothing). There is one merge/MR sink per bundle. The finalization step
removes each corresponding `.roadmap/issue-N.md` source and regenerates
`kaola-workflow/ROADMAP.md` once.

## Startup Step 0a — MR Intent Capture

Before the startup transaction, check the user's initial prompt for MR sink intent.

If the prompt contains any of the following (case-insensitive):
- "open an MR"
- "create an MR"
- "merge request"
- "sink=mr"
- "KAOLA_SINK=mr"
- "MR sink"
- "open a PR" (compatibility alias)
- "create a PR" (compatibility alias)

The PR phrases are accepted only as compatibility aliases. Then export
`KAOLA_SINK=mr` before the startup call. The existing
`${KAOLA_SINK:+--sink $KAOLA_SINK}` pass-through in Startup Step 0 propagates
this value without modification.

Do not set `KAOLA_SINK` if none of the keywords match. Keyword matching is
agent-level prose detection, not a bash conditional.

## Startup Step 0a-1 — Path Intent

Before the Startup transaction, pick the workflow path. The agent owns this judgment;
scripts do not auto-pick. Adaptive is the unconditional default — it just runs. `fast`
and `full` fire ONLY on an explicit path-name keyword or an explicit `KAOLA_PATH`;
nothing to resolve and nothing to deliberate.

1. **Explicit `KAOLA_PATH`.** If already exported, honor it verbatim: `adaptive`
   always; for `fast` | `full`, simply EXPORT the named value and hand it to the claim —
   do NOT re-derive a rubric and do NOT check whether the path is installed. The claim's
   `path_not_installed` typed refusal is the single authority: if the named path isn't
   installed the run surfaces that refusal (a hard stop), it does NOT silently fall to
   adaptive.
2. **Explicit path-name verbal escapes** (case-insensitive) — the ONLY keyword escapes:
   - "fast path" / "fast mode" → `export KAOLA_PATH=fast`
   - "full path" / "full mode" / "full review" / "all phases" → `export KAOLA_PATH=full`
   Just export the named path and hand it to the claim (same as point 1 — no install
   check here either; the claim's `path_not_installed` refusal is the authority). Task
   descriptors ("typo", "one-line", "trivial", "quick fix", "rename", "small change",
   "thorough", "carefully", "deep dive") are NOT path-name escapes; they hit the default
   → adaptive (the planner sizes the task).
3. **Default → adaptive.** No matching path-name keyword and no explicit `KAOLA_PATH` →
   `export KAOLA_PATH=adaptive` and proceed to the Adaptive front-end entry section. The
   export is the action (it makes the Startup transaction skip and the adaptive front end
   fire). Adaptive just runs. There is NO automatic fallback to fast/full. For a normal
   fresh-start draft that never froze, the recourse stays inside adaptive (bounded planner
   repair → discard+restart a fresh adaptive run → stop+ask), per the
   `kaola-workflow-adapt` skill. This startup fallback is forbidden while
   `replan_in_progress`; the re-plan fence permits only the edition-local
   `resume --project {project} --json` mutation.

State the chosen path and one-line reason aloud before the Startup transaction:

```text
Path: adaptive (default)
Path: fast (explicit "fast path" escape)
Path: full (explicit "full review" escape)
```

Bias toward full when in doubt. Fast false positives escalate cleanly via the
Fast Eligibility and Mid-Flight Escalation sections of `plugins/kaola-workflow-gitlab/commands/kaola-workflow-fast.md`; false
negatives only cost ceremony.

## Startup — Adaptive front-end entry (path = adaptive only)

If `KAOLA_PATH=adaptive`, the **starting contract moves into the adaptive front end**: do NOT run
the Startup transaction below for this path. The `workflow-planner` agent role — delegated by
`kaola-workflow-adapt`, never by this router — runs the claim itself, so the router only selects +
validates the issue, then hands off (keeping the router free of phase-agent and claim dispatch — the
only router-side dispatch is the pre-claim, read-only `issue-scout` survey in the no-issue-named
branch, which claims and writes nothing):

1. **Resume wins — never re-author a frozen plan.** If an active folder already exists for the
   target issue and contains `kaola-workflow/{project}/workflow-plan.md`, run `watch-mr` once, then
   route to `kaola-workflow-plan-run {project}` and stop (the same `workflow-plan.md exists ->
   kaola-workflow-plan-run` rule as resume reconstruction). The front end is for FRESH adaptive
   work only.
2. **Fresh adaptive.** Run `watch-mr` once, then route to `kaola-workflow-adapt $KAOLA_TARGET_ISSUE`.
   The adapt skill's `workflow-planner` runs `kaola-gitlab-workflow-claim.js startup --workflow-path
   adaptive --target-issue $KAOLA_TARGET_ISSUE` (the claim + worktree + `workflow-state.md`);
   git-freshness runs inside adapt against MAIN **before** the planner claims (so a dirty/behind main
   never orphans a worktree); the roadmap check runs in adapt too. Do NOT run
   the Startup transaction / git-freshness / roadmap steps in the router for this path.

   **Bundle:** when `KAOLA_TARGET_ISSUES` is set (multi-issue bundle), route to
   `kaola-workflow-adapt` with the full issue set — the planner uses
   `--target-issues $KAOLA_TARGET_ISSUES` instead of `--target-issue N`. See
   the Bundle Lane sections (above and in `kaola-workflow-adapt`) for the planner's claim contract.

Non-adaptive paths (`fast` | `full`) fall through to the Startup transaction unchanged.

## Codex Dispatch Mode Detection

Before the Startup transaction, detect the Codex spawn-tooling shape so the claim can persist
it for later dispatch cards. Reuse the preflight doctor (the same script the Delegation
Contract's tool-availability check above already relies on) rather than re-deriving the config
parse:

```bash
preflight_script="plugins/kaola-workflow-gitlab/scripts/kaola-workflow-codex-preflight.js"
if [ ! -f "$preflight_script" ]; then
  preflight_script="$(find "$HOME/.codex/plugins/cache" -path '*/kaola-workflow-gitlab/*/scripts/kaola-workflow-codex-preflight.js' -print -quit 2>/dev/null)"
fi
KAOLA_CODEX_DISPATCH_MODE=""

An absent or failed detection leaves `KAOLA_CODEX_DISPATCH_MODE` empty — the Startup call below
omits `--codex-dispatch-mode` and the claim keeps its fail-closed `v1-thread-id` default. Never
fabricate a mode; only pass a value the doctor actually reported.

## Startup

**Skip this transaction when `KAOLA_PATH=adaptive`** — the adaptive front end (above) claims via the
`workflow-planner`, not here. It runs for the `fast` and `full` paths only.

Run the startup transaction with the agent-selected target. Startup validates
the explicit issue, refreshes MR-backed folders with `watch-mr`, and atomically
creates or reuses `kaola-workflow/{project}/workflow-state.md`.

```bash
claim_script="plugins/kaola-workflow-gitlab/scripts/kaola-gitlab-workflow-claim.js"
if [ ! -f "$claim_script" ]; then
  claim_script="$(find "$HOME/.codex/plugins/cache" -path '*/kaola-workflow-gitlab/*/scripts/kaola-gitlab-workflow-claim.js' -print -quit 2>/dev/null)"
fi

if [ -f "$claim_script" ]; then
  node "$claim_script" watch-mr >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
  KAOLA_SINK_FLAG=""
  [ -n "${KAOLA_SINK:-}" ] && KAOLA_SINK_FLAG="--sink $KAOLA_SINK"
  KAOLA_TARGET_FLAG=""
  [ -n "${KAOLA_TARGET_ISSUE:-}" ] && KAOLA_TARGET_FLAG="--target-issue $KAOLA_TARGET_ISSUE"
  KAOLA_DISPATCH_MODE_FLAG=""

  echo "BLOCKED: kaola-workflow startup unavailable; cannot select issue-backed work." >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

If `STARTUP_OUT` has `verdict: "owned"`, route that project. If startup returns
`verdict: no_target`, the agent must select a target and re-run. <!-- PIN: claim-escalate -->
If startup returns a typed refusal, read the `reasoning` field and classify by `result`:
- `result: refuse` (`target_occupied`, `user_target_blocked`, `user_target_red`,
  `target_unavailable`, `target_unverified`): **HARD STOP** — the determinate RED is final; do
  not blind-proceed to a different issue without explicit user direction.
- `result: escalate` (`target_indeterminate` / `target_set_indeterminate`): the classifier
  subprocess faulted and bounded retry is exhausted. **PAUSE and ASK THE USER** — offer to retry,
  pick a different target, go offline, or abort. This is NOT an `adaptive-node write-halt`;
  no plan/ledger exists yet at claim time. If the startup script is unavailable, stop for repair.
If startup returns `claim: "none"`, stop normal routing. Do not inspect active
project folders unless the user explicitly names the project to resume.

Before stopping, print the refusal diagnostics:

```text
Startup refusal: verdict=$KAOLA_VERDICT reasoning=$KAOLA_REASONING
```

Classify local and remote Git state:

```bash
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree
git status --short --branch
git remote -v
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u}
git fetch --prune
git status --short --branch
git rev-list --left-right --count @{u}...HEAD
```

Fast-forward only when clean and behind-only. Stop before merge, rebase, stash, reset, conflict resolution, or dirty-worktree sync.

### Git Freshness Block Recovery

If startup succeeds (folder claimed, worktree provisioned) but the Git freshness check blocks (local is behind remote, dirty worktree, or merge/rebase required), attempt fast-forward:

```bash
git fetch --prune
git pull --ff-only
git status --short --branch
```

If the block passes, continue to routing. If the block persists (merge/rebase required, dirty worktree), release the claimed folder before stopping:

```bash
[ "$KAOLA_CLAIM" = "acquired" ] && [ -n "$KAOLA_PROJECT" ] && node "$claim_script" release --project "$KAOLA_PROJECT" --reason git-freshness-block
```

Stop and ask the user to resolve the Git state manually before retrying `/workflow-next`. Do not proceed to routing or adopt any active folder after this release.

### Co-active Folders Advisory

If multiple active folders exist from prior sessions (e.g., `issue-63` and `issue-65` in different states), they operate independently. Each folder has its own `workflow-state.md`, branch, and worktree metadata. The pre-commit hook prevents commits that stage multiple workflow project folders together.

**Important**: Do NOT merge, interleave, or batch commits from different active folders. Each folder must complete its own Phase 4 → Finalization sequence independently. If the same file appears in multiple active write sets, stop and resolve the conflict before continuing — do not proceed with overlapping modifications.

If GitLab is available, refresh open issues:

```bash
glab issue list --limit 100 --json number,title,state,labels,assignees,updatedAt,url
```

Keep `kaola-workflow/ROADMAP.md` as a compact mirror of active unfinished work.

## Routing

Read `kaola-workflow/{project}/workflow-state.md` first. If missing or stale, run:

On resume, extract and reassign `delegation_policy:` alongside `phase` and `next_skill`;
if it is absent, default `delegation_policy` to `delegate` without prompting and continue.

```bash
repair_script="plugins/kaola-workflow-gitlab/scripts/kaola-gitlab-workflow-repair-state.js"
if [ ! -f "$repair_script" ]; then
  repair_script="$(find "$HOME/.codex/plugins/cache" -path '*/kaola-workflow-gitlab/*/scripts/kaola-gitlab-workflow-repair-state.js' -print -quit 2>/dev/null)"
fi
test -f "$repair_script"
node "$repair_script" {project-or-empty}
```

Use the repaired state only when it identifies exactly one safe `next_skill`.
Treat a `kaola-workflow/{project}/workflow-state.md` with `status: active` as
active work even before any `phase*.md` file exists. If there is one
unambiguous open GitLab issue and no active project, select it without asking
the user to confirm the generated workflow folder name.

Manual reconstruction order:

```text
finalization-summary.md exists -> workflow complete
workflow-plan.md exists -> kaola-workflow-plan-run   (adaptive; ahead of the phaseN ladder, toggle-agnostic — a tampered/unparseable plan is a typed refusal, never a phaseN fallback)
phase5-review.md exists -> kaola-workflow-finalize
fast-summary.md status ESCALATED -> kaola-workflow-research
fast-summary.md exists -> kaola-workflow-fast
phase4-progress.md exists:
  open tasks -> kaola-workflow-execute
  all complete -> kaola-workflow-review
phase3-plan.md exists -> kaola-workflow-execute
phase2-ideation.md exists -> kaola-workflow-plan
phase1-research.md exists -> kaola-workflow-ideation
no phase file -> kaola-workflow-research
```

## Required Output

Before continuing or stopping, print:

```text
Workflow project: {project}
Current phase: {phase or unknown}
Current step: {step}
Pending gates: {list or none}
Branch: {branch from Sink block in workflow-state.md, or TBD if not yet claimed}
Workflow path: {adaptive by default; fast|full only on an explicit path-name keyword or KAOLA_PATH — from KAOLA_PATH or Step 0a-1 judgment}
Parallel decision: {green|yellow|red|blocked|target_unavailable|target_unverified|skipped — classifier verdict or "skipped" if offline/unavailable}
Next skill: {next_skill}
```

## Completion Contract

Each kaola-workflow-next run implements exactly one issue **or one explicitly selected
same-scope bundle**. After kaola-workflow-finalize closes the issue (or every issue in
the bundle) and releases the lease, the completion contract is satisfied. Stop and await
explicit re-direction. Do not auto-route into the next issue in line.

A bundle closure is all-or-nothing: finalization closes EVERY issue in `issue_numbers`,
removes each `.roadmap/issue-N.md` source, regenerates `kaola-workflow/ROADMAP.md` once,
archives one bundle folder, and then stops.
