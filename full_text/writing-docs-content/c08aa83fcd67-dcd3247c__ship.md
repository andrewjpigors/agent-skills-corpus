  Canonical Nexus ship command. Persists the governed release gate, checklist state,
  and structured ship readiness for the governed Nexus lifecycle. Use when the user
  says "ship it", "merge to main", "release the change", or asks to gate a branch
  on its pre-merge readiness checks. (nexus)

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not proactively suggest Nexus commands AND do not
auto-invoke skills based on conversation context. Only run skills the user explicitly
types (e.g., /qa, /ship). If you would have auto-invoked a skill, instead briefly say:
"I think /skillname might help here — want me to run it?" and wait for confirmation.
The user opted out of proactive behavior.

If `SKILL_PREFIX` is `"true"`, the user has namespaced Nexus commands. When suggesting
or invoking other Nexus commands, use the `/nexus-` prefix (e.g., `/nexus-qa` instead
of `/qa`, `/nexus-ship` instead of `/ship`). Disk paths are unaffected — always use
`~/.claude/skills/nexus/[skill-name]/SKILL.md` for reading skill files.

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.claude/skills/nexus/nexus-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the release-based "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined). `/nexus-upgrade` now upgrades from published Nexus releases on the configured release channel, not from upstream repo head. If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell user "Running Nexus v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present, always include the standardized runtime summary before moving on to work, even when `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `yes`.

When summarizing setup or upgrade state, always keep `REPO_MODE` and `EXECUTION_MODE` separate:
- `REPO_MODE` is repo ownership only, for example `solo` or `collaborative`
- `EXECUTION_MODE` is runtime routing only, either `governed_ccb` or `local_provider`
- Never describe `solo` or `collaborative` as an execution mode
- If `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no`, say it is the current default derived from machine state, not a saved preference
- `EXECUTION_MODE_SOURCE` explains whether the active route came from a saved preference or a machine-state default
- `EXECUTION_PATH` is the current effective route, for example `codex-via-ccb`
- `CURRENT_SESSION_READY` tells you whether the chosen route is runnable right now in this host/session
- `REQUIRED_GOVERNED_PROVIDERS` is the governed provider set Nexus needs for the standard dual-audit path
- when `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb`, also surface `GOVERNED_READY`, `MOUNTED_PROVIDERS`, and `MISSING_PROVIDERS`
- `LOCAL_PROVIDER_CANDIDATE`, `LOCAL_PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY`, `LOCAL_PROVIDER_EXECUTION_PATH`, and `LOCAL_PROVIDER_READY` describe the current-host local fallback path

Whenever you summarize setup, upgrade, or first-run state, present runtime status in this order:
- Repo mode: `REPO_MODE`
- Execution mode: `EXECUTION_MODE` plus whether it is a saved preference or a machine-state default (`EXECUTION_MODE_SOURCE`)
- Execution path: `EXECUTION_PATH`
- Current session ready: `CURRENT_SESSION_READY`
- If `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb`: governed ready, mounted providers, missing providers
- If `EXECUTION_MODE=local_provider` because governed CCB is not ready, explicitly say whether that is because CCB is missing or because mounted providers are incomplete, and include the local fallback path
- Branch: `_BRANCH`
- Proactive: `PROACTIVE`

When `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb` and `CURRENT_SESSION_READY` is `no`, explicitly tell the user whether the gap is:
- CCB not installed (`CCB_AVAILABLE=no`), or
- CCB installed but required providers are not mounted (`MISSING_PROVIDERS` is non-empty)

If `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb` and `CURRENT_SESSION_READY` is `no` and `LOCAL_PROVIDER_READY` is `yes`, use AskUserQuestion before moving into lifecycle work:

> Nexus is currently configured for governed CCB, but this session cannot run that route.
> The local provider path is ready, so you can either switch this host to local_provider or keep the governed CCB preference and mount the missing providers.
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose A if you want to work now in this host. Choose B only if you intend to mount CCB providers before continuing.
> A) Switch this host to local_provider (human: ~0m / CC: ~0m) — Completeness: 8/10
> B) Keep governed_ccb and mount the missing CCB providers (human: ~2m / CC: ~0m) — Completeness: 9/10

If A:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set execution_mode local_provider
if [ -n "$_LOCAL_PROVIDER_CANDIDATE" ]; then
  ~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set primary_provider "$_LOCAL_PROVIDER_CANDIDATE"
fi
if [ -n "$_LOCAL_PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY" ]; then
  ~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set provider_topology "$_LOCAL_PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY"
fi
```
Then explain that future Nexus runs on this host will use `local_provider` until the user changes the saved preference.

If B: do not change Nexus config. Tell the user to mount the missing providers before running governed commands. If CCB is installed but providers are missing, say the standard start path is `tmux` with `ccb codex gemini claude`. If CCB is not installed, say they need to install or restore CCB first.

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present and `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no`, state the effective execution mode explicitly using `EXECUTION_MODE`, `EXECUTION_MODE_SOURCE`, and `CCB_AVAILABLE`. Use `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config effective-execution` when you need the effective provider, topology, or requested execution path.
When `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb`, do not ask the user to configure `PRIMARY_PROVIDER` or `PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY`. Those are local-provider host preferences, not governed CCB config keys.

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present and `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no` and `GOVERNED_READY` is `yes`, use AskUserQuestion to persist the execution preference:

> Nexus just upgraded, but this machine still has no saved execution-mode preference.
> Repo mode only tells you whether the repo is solo or collaborative.
> Execution mode tells Nexus whether to stay in this Claude session or move to the governed CCB path.
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose B if you want the standard governed Nexus path, because CCB is already installed. Completeness: 9/10.
> A) Stay in the current Claude session with local_provider (human: ~0m / CC: ~0m) — Completeness: 8/10
> B) Persist governed_ccb and use mounted CCB providers (human: ~1m / CC: ~0m) — Completeness: 9/10

If A:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set execution_mode local_provider
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set primary_provider claude
```
Then explain that the current session can continue with `local_provider`, and if `PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY` is empty the default local topology is `single_agent`. Claude local-provider topologies invoke the local Claude CLI; inside Claude Code they are guarded unless `NEXUS_ALLOW_NESTED_CLAUDE=1` is set.

If B:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set execution_mode governed_ccb
```
Then explain that `governed_ccb` requires active CCB providers for this repo, and that the standard way to start them is `tmux` with `ccb codex gemini claude` if they are not already mounted.

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present and `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no` and `GOVERNED_READY` is `no`, tell the user Nexus is defaulting to `local_provider` for this host/session. If `CCB_AVAILABLE` is `no`, say that CCB is not detected. If `CCB_AVAILABLE` is `yes`, say which providers are mounted and which are still missing. In both cases, state the effective local provider/topology/path and tell them they can run `./setup` later if they want Nexus to help persist a different execution preference.

If `LAKE_INTRO` is `no`: Before continuing, introduce the Nexus Completeness Principle.
Tell the user: "Nexus follows the **Completeness Principle** — when the bounded, correct
implementation costs only a little more than the shortcut, prefer finishing the real job."

Then run:

```bash
touch ~/.nexus/.completeness-intro-seen
```

This only happens once.

If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `no` AND `LAKE_INTRO` is `yes`: After the lake intro is handled,
ask the user about proactive behavior. Use AskUserQuestion:

> Nexus can proactively figure out when you might need a skill while you work —
> like suggesting /qa when you say "does this work?" or /investigate when you hit
> a bug. We recommend keeping this on — it speeds up every part of your workflow.

Options:
- A) Keep it on (recommended)
- B) Turn it off — I'll type /commands myself

If A: run `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set proactive true`
If B: run `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set proactive false`

Always run:
```bash
touch ~/.nexus/.proactive-prompted
```

This only happens once. If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`, skip this entirely.

If `HAS_ROUTING` is `no` AND `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `false` AND `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`:
Check if a CLAUDE.md file exists in the project root. If it does not exist, create it.
Before prompting, treat either the standard `## Nexus Skill Routing` section or any
existing instruction that routes lifecycle work through `/discover` to `/closeout`
as equivalent Nexus routing guidance. If equivalent guidance already exists, skip this entirely.

Use AskUserQuestion:

> Nexus works best when your project's CLAUDE.md includes canonical Nexus command
> routing guidance. This helps Claude invoke `/discover` through `/closeout`
> consistently without turning CLAUDE.md into a second contract layer.

Options:
- A) Add Nexus invocation guidance to CLAUDE.md (recommended)
- B) No thanks, I'll invoke Nexus commands manually

If A: Append this section to the end of CLAUDE.md only when the file does not already
contain equivalent Nexus routing guidance:

```markdown

## Nexus Skill Routing

When the user's request matches a canonical Nexus command, invoke that command first.
This guidance helps command discovery only.
Contracts, transitions, governed artifacts, and lifecycle truth are owned by `lib/nexus/`
and canonical `.planning/` artifacts.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke discover
- Scope definition, requirements framing, non-goals → invoke frame
- Architecture review, execution readiness, implementation planning → invoke plan
- Governed routing and handoff packaging → invoke handoff
- Bounded implementation execution → invoke build
- Code review, check my diff → invoke review
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke qa
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke ship
- Final governed verification and closure → invoke closeout
```

Do not auto-commit the file. After updating `CLAUDE.md`, tell the user the routing
guidance was added and can be committed with their next repo change.

If B: run `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set routing_declined true`
Say "No problem. You can add routing guidance later by running `nexus-config set routing_declined false` and re-running any Nexus skill."

This only happens once per project. If `HAS_ROUTING` is `yes` or `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `true`, skip this entirely.

## Voice

**Tone:** direct, concrete, sharp, never corporate, never academic. Sound like a builder, not a consultant. Name the file, the function, the command. No filler, no throat-clearing.

**Writing rules:** No em dashes (use commas, periods, "..."). No AI vocabulary (delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, etc.). Short paragraphs. End with what to do.

The user always has context you don't. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision — the user decides.

## Stage-Aware Local Topology Chooser

If `EXECUTION_MODE=local_provider` and `PRIMARY_PROVIDER=claude`, ask the user which local execution topology to use before starting `/ship`.

RECOMMENDATION: Choose B by default for release / QA / security / docs-deploy gates; choose C when you want the reviewers to coordinate directly before the ship decision. Completeness: 9/10.

Use AskUserQuestion with these options:
- A) `single_agent` - One Claude subprocess for direct terminal sessions. Lowest coordination overhead and safest for sequential work.
- B) `subagents` - Focused local Claude CLI subagents. Good for quick parallel checks whose results return to the lead.
- C) `agent_team` — Claude Code Agent Teams. Best when teammates should coordinate, challenge each other, or work from independent perspectives.

If `LOCAL_CLAUDE_AGENT_TEAM_READY` is not `yes`, still show option C but mark it unavailable and include `LOCAL_CLAUDE_AGENT_TEAM_REASON`. Do not set `agent_team` unless the user explicitly chooses to configure Claude Code first.

Stage-specific guidance:
- `/review`: `agent_team` maps naturally to code / security / test / performance / design reviewers.
- `/investigate`: `agent_team` maps naturally to competing root-cause hypotheses.
- `/frame` and `/plan`: `agent_team` maps naturally to CEO / engineering / design / risk perspectives.
- `/build`: prefer `single_agent` for same-file edits or tightly coupled implementation; only choose team modes when file ownership can be split.
- `/ship`: `subagents` or `agent_team` can cover release / QA / security / docs-deploy gates.

If the user chooses A:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set provider_topology single_agent
```

If the user chooses B:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set provider_topology subagents
```

If the user chooses C and `LOCAL_CLAUDE_AGENT_TEAM_READY=yes`:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set provider_topology agent_team
```

After setting the topology, continue with the canonical Nexus command.

## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. At the end of each major workflow step, rate your Nexus experience 0-10. If not a 10 and there's an actionable bug or improvement — file a field report.

**File only:** Nexus tooling bugs where the input was reasonable but Nexus failed. **Skip:** user app bugs, network errors, auth failures on user's site.

**To file:** write `~/.nexus/contributor-logs/{slug}.md`:
```
# {Title}
**What I tried:** {action} | **What happened:** {result} | **Rating:** {0-10}
## Repro
1. {step}
## What would make this a 10
{one sentence}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```
Slug: lowercase hyphens, max 60 chars. Skip if exists. Max 3/session. File inline, don't stop.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```

## Plan Mode Safe Operations

When in plan mode, these operations are always allowed because they produce
artifacts that inform the plan, not code changes:

- `$B` commands (browse: screenshots, page inspection, navigation, snapshots)
- `$D` commands (design: generate mockups, variants, comparison boards, iterate)
- `codex exec` / `codex review` only when the active provider route allows Codex
  or the user explicitly asks for Codex; in `local_provider` with a non-Codex
  primary, use the host/local subagent path instead
- Writing to `~/.nexus/` (config, review artifacts, design artifacts, learnings, eureka notes)
- Writing to the plan file (already allowed by plan mode)
- `open` commands for viewing generated artifacts (comparison boards, HTML previews)

These are read-only in spirit — they inspect the live site, generate visual artifacts,
or get independent opinions. They do NOT modify project source files.

## Plan Status Footer

When you are in plan mode and about to call ExitPlanMode:

1. Check if the plan file already has a `## NEXUS REVIEW REPORT` section.
2. If it DOES — skip (a review skill already wrote a richer report).
3. If it does NOT — run this command:

\`\`\`bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-review-read
\`\`\`

Then write a `## NEXUS REVIEW REPORT` section to the end of the plan file:

- If the output contains review entries (JSONL lines before `---CONFIG---`): format the
  standard report table with runs/status/findings per skill, same format as the review
  skills use.
- If the output is `NO_REVIEWS` or empty: write this placeholder table:

\`\`\`markdown
## NEXUS REVIEW REPORT

| Review | Trigger | Why | Runs | Status | Findings |
|--------|---------|-----|------|--------|----------|
| CEO Review | \`/plan-ceo-review\` | Scope & strategy | 0 | — | — |
| Codex Review | \`/codex review\` | Independent 2nd opinion | 0 | — | — |
| Eng Review | \`/plan-eng-review\` | Architecture & tests (required) | 0 | — | — |
| Design Review | \`/plan-design-review\` | UI/UX gaps | 0 | — | — |

**VERDICT:** NO REVIEWS YET — run \`/autoplan\` for full review pipeline, or individual reviews above.
\`\`\`

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This writes to the plan file, which is the one
file you are allowed to edit in plan mode. The plan file review report is part of the
plan's living status.

# /ship — Nexus Governed Ship

Nexus-owned ship guidance for governed release gating and explicit merge readiness.

## Iron Laws (mandatory; non-negotiable)

These three rules apply to every `/ship` invocation regardless of provider, topology, or run mode. They are short and absolute on purpose — discipline that lives in qualifiers does not survive contact with the LLM at decision time. `/ship` is the merge boundary; ambiguity here lands as broken main.

### Law 1 — Pre-Merge Readiness Gate (Five Mandatory Checks)

`/ship` cannot mark `release-gate-record.md` `ready` without ALL of these visible in the advisor record at decision time:

1. **Tests pass with output evidence in this turn** — the verification command for the change ran in the current message AND its output is attached. Stale CI runs from a previous turn are not evidence; they describe a different state of the tree (mirrors `/build` Law 1, `/review` Law 1).
2. **CI green on the head SHA** — the CI run for the exact commit being merged completes green. CI green on an earlier commit is not green for what's being shipped.
3. **`/review` verdict is current and not stale** — the `pass_round` field in the advisor record is the latest review pass; subsequent commits to the branch invalidate it (per `/review` Law 2). If commits landed after Pass 2, re-enter `/review`.
4. **`/qa` verdict is `ready` or `ready_with_findings`** when `/qa` was run. `/qa` verdict `not_ready` is non-negotiable: any P0 finding, console regression, or primary-flow health check failure (per `/qa` Law 2) blocks `/ship`. There is no override.
5. **Branch is up-to-date with base** — the branch contains the latest base-branch commit. Stale-base merges introduce conflicts that the gate didn't see; rebase first, then re-verify checks 1–4.

If any check fails, `/ship` returns `not_ready` and refuses to merge. The release gate is the contract for downstream `/closeout`; ambiguity here lands as broken main.

### Law 2 — Refuse To Ship Broken

`/ship` MUST refuse to merge when any of these conditions hold, regardless of operator framing:

1. **No silent merges past failed checks** — if any of the five readiness checks (Law 1) fails, `/ship` STOPS. The advisor record carries `release_gate: not_ready` with the failing check enumerated. The operator either fixes the failure or routes back through the relevant stage (`/build`, `/review`, `/qa`).
2. **No force-push to base or shared branches** — `git push --force` to `main`, `master`, or release branches is forbidden. `/ship` operates on the ship branch only; the merge happens via PR mechanics, not by overwriting base history.
3. **No skipping CI** — `[skip ci]` commit messages, `--no-verify` flags, or branch-protection bypasses are forbidden at the `/ship` layer. CI is part of the readiness gate (Law 1, check 2); skipping CI ≡ skipping the gate.

When the user asks `/ship` to merge despite a failing check, the answer is to surface the check and explain. Bad work is worse than no work; a regression shipped past a failing check costs more than the revisit. The user can choose to re-enter the failing stage; `/ship` cannot choose to overlook it.

This rule has one exception path: an explicit, documented, time-boxed override flow that requires `AskUserQuestion` confirmation AND records the override in `release-gate-record.md` with rationale. Silent override is not an option.

### Law 3 — Branch Decision Tree Is Explicit

When `/ship` runs, the work on the ship branch ends in exactly one of four outcomes. The operator picks; `/ship` records the choice in `pull-request.json` and `release-gate-record.md`:

1. **Merge** — readiness gate is `ready`, the PR merges to base, the branch is deleted (per repo policy). Standard happy path.
2. **Keep alive** — the branch is not ready to merge but represents valid in-progress work. `/ship` records `release_gate: deferred` with a one-paragraph reason ("blocked on dependency X", "awaiting design review", "scheduled for next release window"). The branch remains; `/closeout` may not consume it yet.
3. **Discard** — the work was explored, learned from, but is not shipping. `/ship` records `release_gate: discarded` with a discovery-style note (what was tried, what was learned, why this approach didn't proceed). The branch closes without merge.
4. **Split** — the branch contains too much; some commits are mergeable now, others need rework. `/ship` records `release_gate: split` and routes back to `/plan` to extend the contract (per `/plan` Law 3) for the unmergeable subset, while the mergeable subset advances through Law 1.

Outcomes 2–4 are not failures; they are honest endings. The failure mode is "neither merging nor explicitly choosing one of the other three." Branches in limbo accumulate; in-flight branches without an outcome become operational debt.

`/ship` does not auto-pick an outcome. The operator picks; the artifact records the choice.

## How to run /ship

These steps execute one `/ship` run. Iron Laws constrain *what must be true at decision time*; this workflow defines *what to do in what order*. Both apply. `/ship` is the merge boundary — every step here either confirms the readiness gate or refuses the merge.

### Step 1 — Verify the pre-merge readiness gate

Per Law 1, `/ship` cannot mark `release-gate-record.md` `ready` without all five mandatory checks visible at decision time:

1. Tests pass with output evidence in this turn
2. CI green on the head SHA
3. `/review` `pass_round` is current and not stale
4. `/qa` verdict is `ready` or `ready_with_findings` (when `/qa` was run)
5. Branch is up-to-date with base

Walk each check explicitly. Stale CI from a prior turn does not count; a `/review` pass invalidated by later commits does not count. If a check needs rerunning, rerun it in this turn.

### Step 2 — If any check fails, refuse the merge

Per Law 2, `/ship` MUST refuse when any readiness check (Law 1) fails. The advisor record carries `release_gate: not_ready` with the failing check enumerated, and the operator routes back through the relevant stage (`/build`, `/review`, `/qa`).

Three shortcuts are forbidden regardless of operator framing:

- No silent merges past failed checks
- No force-push to base or shared branches
- No `[skip ci]`, `--no-verify`, or branch-protection bypasses

Bad work is worse than no work. The exception path (Law 2) is explicit, time-boxed, and requires `AskUserQuestion` confirmation plus a recorded rationale in `release-gate-record.md`. Silent override is not an option.

### Step 3 — Pick the branch outcome

If the readiness gate is verified, surface the four explicit outcomes per Law 3 and let the operator pick. Use `AskUserQuestion`:

> "The readiness gate is verified. How should this branch end?
> (a) Merge — the PR merges to base, branch deleted per repo policy
> (b) Keep alive — record `release_gate: deferred` with a one-paragraph reason (blocked dep, design pending, scheduled for next window)
> (c) Discard — record `release_gate: discarded` with a discovery-style note (what was tried, what was learned)
> (d) Split — record `release_gate: split` and route back to `/plan` Law 3 to extend the contract for the unmergeable subset"

`/ship` does not auto-pick. Outcomes 2–4 are honest endings, not failures; the only failure mode is "neither merging nor explicitly choosing one of the other three." Branches in limbo become operational debt.

### Step 4 — Push the ship branch (if merging)

If the operator picked Merge, ensure the ship branch is pushed before PR creation. If `pull-request.json` records `status: "push_required"`, `/ship` remains not-ready until the branch is pushed and `/ship` is rerun to create or reuse the PR handoff. `/closeout` must not run while `push_required` is on the record.

For Keep alive / Discard / Split, push state is informational only — the outcome is recorded and the merge does not happen.

### Step 5 — Write `release-gate-record.md`

Write the canonical release-gate artifact. It records:

- `release_gate: ready | not_ready | deferred | discarded | split`
- The five Law 1 checks with their evidence (test output reference, CI run URL, `pass_round` value, `/qa` verdict, base-branch SHA)
- For `not_ready`, the failing check with its block reason
- For `deferred | discarded | split`, the rationale per Law 3
- For any Law 2 exception path use, the recorded override with rationale and `AskUserQuestion` confirmation timestamp

This artifact is the contract `/closeout` consumes. Ambiguity here lands as broken main or laundered runs downstream.

### Step 6 — Record outcome in `pull-request.json`

`pull-request.json` carries the PR handoff state (`open`, `merged`, `push_required`, etc.) and the chosen Law 3 outcome. The PR handoff belongs to `/ship` — `/closeout` verifies the completed handoff but does not create or repair PR state (per `/closeout` Law 3).

For follow-on attestations, `/canary` may add `canary-status.json` and `/land-and-deploy` may add `deploy-result.json` without changing the canonical ship state recorded here.

### Step 7 — Write status

Run the canonical command (in the Routing section below). It writes `release-gate-record.md`, `checklist.json`, `deploy-readiness.json`, `pull-request.json`, `status.json`, and (optionally) `learning-candidates.json`. The advisor record carries the verdict; `/closeout` reads it.

## Operator Checklist

- require completed review artifacts
- require ready QA when QA was run
- keep merge and release readiness explicit in canonical gate artifacts
- keep the ordering explicit: commit stage artifacts, push the ship branch, create or reuse the PR, then allow closeout

## Artifact Contract

Writes `.planning/current/ship/release-gate-record.md`,
`.planning/current/ship/checklist.json`,
`.planning/current/ship/deploy-readiness.json`,
`.planning/current/ship/pull-request.json`,
`.planning/current/ship/status.json`, and optionally
`.planning/current/ship/learning-candidates.json` when ship raw output contains
valid reusable learning candidates. `/closeout` may consume that optional
artifact when assembling run learnings.
Requires QA design verification for design-bearing runs before recording a ready ship state.
Requires the ship branch to be pushed before PR creation. If the release gate is
merge-ready but `.planning/current/ship/pull-request.json` records
`status: "push_required"`, `/ship` remains not-ready and `/closeout` must not run
until the branch is pushed and `/ship` is rerun to create or reuse the PR handoff.

Follow-on support workflows may attach additional ship evidence without
changing canonical ship state, including
`.planning/current/ship/canary-status.json` from `/canary` and
`.planning/current/ship/deploy-result.json` from `/land-and-deploy`.

## Routing

Ship content starts only after completed review and optional ready QA. It must not imply any bypass of review, audit persistence, PR handoff, or closeout. Superpowers ship discipline informs the release gate, but Nexus-owned ship artifacts remain the only release authority. The PR handoff belongs to `/ship`; `/closeout` verifies the completed handoff and must not create or repair PR state.

Run:

```bash
_REPO_CWD="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
_NEXUS_ROOT="~/.claude/skills/nexus"
[ -d "$_REPO_CWD/.claude/skills/nexus" ] && _NEXUS_ROOT="$_REPO_CWD/.claude/skills/nexus"
cd "$_NEXUS_ROOT" && NEXUS_PROJECT_CWD="$_REPO_CWD" ./bin/nexus ship
```

## Typical prompts

These are example user requests `/ship` handles well. The skill verifies the readiness gate, surfaces the branch-outcome decision, and writes the canonical release-gate artifact.

### Prompt 1 — Standard merge

> "Ship it."

`/ship` walks Step 1 to verify all five Law 1 checks (tests fresh in this turn, CI green on head SHA, `pass_round` current, `/qa` verdict ready or ready_with_findings, branch up-to-date with base). If any check is stale or fails, Step 2 refuses the merge and surfaces which check blocked. If all pass, Step 3 surfaces the four-outcome decision; on Merge, Steps 4–7 push the branch (if needed), record `release_gate: ready` in `release-gate-record.md`, and write `pull-request.json` with the merged status.

### Prompt 2 — P0 surfaced but operator wants to merge anyway

> "QA found a P0 but I want to ship — we'll patch it next sprint."

Per Law 2, "no silent merges past failed checks." Step 1's check 4 reads the `/qa` verdict (`not_ready` because of the P0); Step 2 refuses the merge and surfaces the failing check with its block reason. The exception path is the only release valve, and it requires explicit `AskUserQuestion` confirmation plus a recorded rationale in `release-gate-record.md` (per Law 2). `/ship` does not silently override; the operator chooses to invoke the exception path on the record, or routes back through `/qa`.

### Prompt 3 — In-progress branch the team isn't ready to delete

> "This branch isn't ready to merge but we don't want to discard it — we'll come back to it."

Step 3 surfaces the four-outcome `AskUserQuestion`; the operator picks Keep alive. `/ship` records `release_gate: deferred` with a one-paragraph reason ("blocked on dependency X", "awaiting design review", "scheduled for next window"). The branch remains; `/closeout` may not consume it yet. This is Law 3 outcome 2 — an honest ending, not a failure.

These prompts test that `/ship` enforces the readiness gate (Law 1), refuses to ship broken (Law 2), and surfaces the four explicit branch outcomes (Law 3) rather than auto-picking or silently merging.

## Completion Advisor

After `/ship` returns, prefer the runtime JSON field `completion_advisor`. If the host only has
filesystem access, or the field is absent, fall back to `.planning/current/ship/completion-advisor.json`.
If the runtime exited nonzero, inspect `completion_context.completion_advisor` from the error JSON
envelope before falling back to disk. Treat that advisor as the canonical next-step contract.

Read and summarize:

- `summary`
- `stage_outcome`
- `interaction_mode`
- `requires_user_choice`
- `primary_next_actions`
- `alternative_next_actions`
- `recommended_side_skills`
- `stop_action`
- `project_setup_gaps`
- `suppressed_surfaces`
- `default_action_id`

If `interaction_mode` is `summary_only`, do not call AskUserQuestion. Print the advisor
`summary`, any `project_setup_gaps`, and the invocation for the `default_action_id` if one exists.

If the session is interactive and `interaction_mode` is not `summary_only`, always use
AskUserQuestion for `/ship` completion.

If the host cannot display AskUserQuestion, rerun `/ship` with `--output interactive`
to print the same runtime-owned chooser in the terminal. Do not reconstruct choices
from `status.json`.

If `interaction_mode` is `recommended_choice`, present:

1. recommended primary action
2. other primary actions
3. alternatives
4. recommended side skills
5. `stop_action`

If `interaction_mode` is `required_choice`, present only the actions emitted by the advisor.

Use each action's `label` and `description`. If an action has `visibility_reason`,
`why_this_skill`, or `evidence_signal`, include it in the explanation so the user sees
why it is showing up now.

After the user chooses an action, run the selected `invocation` unless the selected action
is `stop_action` or has no invocation.

The advisor is where ship-level deploy awareness now lives. Use it to surface:

- `/land` as the recommended post-ship PR landing path
- `/land-and-deploy` as the compatibility shortcut for combined landing/deploy
- `/setup-deploy` when deploy configuration is still incomplete
- `/deploy` only after landing, when a deploy surface is configured
- `/closeout` when landing was handled manually or intentionally deferred
- `/document-release` as follow-on release hygiene

If the session is non-interactive, print the advisor `summary` and the invocation for the
`default_action_id` when one exists.
