# FrontMCP Development Router

Entry point for building MCP server components. This skill helps you find the right development reference based on what you want to build. It does not teach implementation details itself — it routes you to the specific reference (under `references/`) that does.

## When to Use This Skill

### Must Use

- Starting a FrontMCP development task and unsure which component type to build (tool vs resource vs prompt vs agent)
- Onboarding to the FrontMCP development model and need an overview of all building blocks
- Planning a feature that may require multiple component types working together

### Recommended

- Looking up the canonical name of a development reference to install or search
- Comparing component types to decide which fits your use case
- Understanding how tools, resources, prompts, agents, and skills relate to each other

### Skip When

- You already know which component to build (go directly to `create-tool`, `create-resource`, etc.)
- You need to configure server settings, not build components (see `frontmcp-config`)
- You need to deploy or build, not develop (see `frontmcp-deployment`)

> **Decision:** Use this skill when you need to figure out WHAT to build. Open the matching reference under `references/` directly when you already know.

## Prerequisites

- A scaffolded FrontMCP project (see `frontmcp-setup` if you don't have one).
- Familiarity with TypeScript decorators and Zod schemas — every component is decorator-driven and validates I/O via Zod.
- Decide whether you're adding to an existing `@App` or composing a new one (multi-app projects: see `multi-app-composition`).

## Steps

This is a router skill. The "steps" here are how to choose the right reference (a markdown file under `references/`), not how to implement a component.

1. **Identify the component type** using the Scenario Routing Table below.
2. **Open the matching reference** (e.g. `references/create-tool.md`, `references/create-resource.md`) and follow its Steps section.
3. **Compose**, if needed: most non-trivial features need two or more components (e.g. tool + provider, resource + adapter). Read each reference independently before wiring them together.
4. **Test before integration** (`frontmcp-testing`) — every component type has a unit-test recipe.

| File naming       | All components                    | Use `<name>.<type>.ts` pattern (e.g., `fetch-weather.tool.ts`)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| DI access         | Tools, resources, prompts, agents | Use `this.get(TOKEN)` (throws) or `this.tryGet(TOKEN)` (returns undefined)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Error handling    | All components                    | Use `this.fail(err)` with MCP error classes, not raw `throw`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Input validation  | Tools                             | Always use Zod raw shapes (not `z.object()`) for `inputSchema`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Output validation | Tools                             | Always define `outputSchema` to prevent data leaks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Registration      | All components                    | **Best practice:** register components in their owning `@App`. `@FrontMcp` also accepts entity arrays at the top level (`tools`, `resources`, `skills`, `providers`, `plugins`, `jobs`, `channels`, `authorities`) for simple single-app servers, but `@App` provides modularity, per-app auth, and lifecycle hooks. |
| Test files        | All components                    | Use `.spec.ts` extension, never `.test.ts`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Common Patterns

| Pattern                 | Correct                                                   | Incorrect                                                | Why                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Choosing component type | Tool for actions, Resource for data, Prompt for templates | Using a tool to return static data                       | Each type has protocol-level semantics; misuse confuses AI clients    |
| Component registration  | Register in `@App` arrays, compose apps in `@FrontMcp`    | Register tools directly in `@FrontMcp` without an `@App` | Apps provide modularity; direct registration bypasses app-level hooks |
| Shared logic            | Extract to a `@Provider` and inject via DI                | Duplicate code across multiple tools                     | Providers are testable, lifecycle-managed, and scoped                 |
| Complex orchestration   | Use `@Agent` with inner tools                             | Chain tool calls manually in a single tool               | Agents handle LLM loops, retries, and tool selection automatically    |
| Background work         | Use `@Job` with retry config                              | Run long tasks inside a tool's `execute()`               | Jobs have progress tracking, attempt awareness, and timeout handling  |

## Verification Checklist

### Architecture

- [ ] Each component type matches its semantic purpose (action=tool, data=resource, template=prompt)
- [ ] Shared services use `@Provider` with DI tokens, not module-level singletons
- [ ] Components are registered in `@App` arrays, apps composed in `@FrontMcp`

### Development Workflow

- [ ] Files follow `<name>.<type>.ts` naming convention
- [ ] Each component has a corresponding `.spec.ts` test file
- [ ] `decorators-guide` consulted for unfamiliar decorator options

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                                  | Cause                                          | Solution                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unsure which component type to use       | Requirements are ambiguous                     | Check the Scenario Routing Table above; if the action modifies state, use a tool; if it returns data by URI, use a resource |
| Component not discovered at runtime      | Not registered in `@App` or `@FrontMcp` arrays | Add to the appropriate array (`tools`, `resources`, `prompts`, etc.)                                                        |
| DI token not resolving                   | Provider not registered in scope               | Register the provider in the `providers` array of the same `@App`                                                           |
| Need both AI guidance and tool execution | Used `create-skill` but need tools too         | Switch to `create-skill-with-tools` which combines instructions with registered tools                                       |

## Accessing This Skill

Skills are distributed as plain SKILL.md files plus a sibling `references/`
and `examples/` tree, so consumers can pick whichever access mode fits:

| Mode               | How it works                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **Filesystem**     | Read `libs/skills/catalog/frontmcp-development/` directly from a clone of the catalog repo, or from a published `@frontmcp/skills` install. SKILL.md is the entry point.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **`frontmcp` CLI** | `frontmcp skills list`, `frontmcp skills read frontmcp-development`, `frontmcp skills read frontmcp-development:references/<file>.md`, `frontmcp skills install frontmcp-development` — no server required.                                                                                                                                               |
| **MCP `skill://`** | When a developer mounts this skill into their own FrontMCP server (`@FrontMcp({ skills: [...] })`), the SDK exposes it via SEP-2640 resources: `skill://frontmcp-development/SKILL.md`, `skill://frontmcp-development/references/{file}.md`, etc. The server’s `skill://index.json` returns the SEP-2640 discovery document for everything mounted on it. |

The catalog itself is **not** an MCP server. The `skill://` URIs only resolve
when a server has been configured to host this skill.
