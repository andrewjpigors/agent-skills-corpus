# Core Mesh → Istio — Full Migration Orchestrator

This skill runs the complete migration described in the guide.
It is an **orchestrator**: the heavy lifting lives in two atomic sub-skills, and this
skill coordinates them, performs the remaining steps, and keeps an auditable log.

## Invocation

Run this skill against the chart or service directory to migrate. Examples:

- `mesh-test-service-go`
- `helm-templates/my-service`
- `.`

inline as an embedded procedure. Do not spawn subprocesses or defer to external
tooling — carry out each instruction as if it were written directly in this skill.

---

## Inputs the agent must resolve up front

Before starting any step, confirm or ask the user for:

1. **Chart path** — path to the Helm chart to migrate (e.g. `helm-templates/my-service`).
2. **Source code path** — path to Go/Java route registration code (often `./` or `src/`).
3. **Service language(s)** — Go, Java, or both. Affects Step 2 substeps.
4. **Build system** — Maven (Java) or `go.mod` (Go). Needed for Step 2.

If any is missing, ask before proceeding. Do not guess the chart path.

### Backend reference (`backendRefName` / `backendRefPort`) — do NOT ask up front

The `backendRefs[].name` and `backendRefs[].port` applied to generated HTTPRoutes
are **migration-wide** values, but they are **not** collected at orchestrator
start. Resolve them as follows:

1. **Step 1** invokes [`core-mesh-crs-to-gatewayapi`](../core-mesh-crs-to-gatewayapi/SKILL.md),
   which detects the service's own backend `name`/`port` from the existing mesh
   `RouteConfiguration` destinations (one migrated service contains only routes
   for itself) and reports them in its output as `backendRefName` /
   `backendRefPort`.
2. **If Step 1 resolved both values** → capture them, record them in
   `MIGRATION_LOG.md` (under **Done**), and reuse them in **Step 2.3** and
   **Step 2.4** without prompting.
3. **If Step 1 could not resolve them** (no declarative mesh CRs, ambiguous /
   conflicting destinations, or Step 1 was skipped) → ask the user **explicitly**
   at the point they are first needed (Step 2.3 for Java, Step 2.4 otherwise),
   proposing the defaults `{{ .Values.DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME }}` and `8080`.
   Do not ask earlier than necessary.

Once resolved (detected or user-provided), the same values MUST be:
- passed to the Maven plugin config in **Step 2.3** (`<backendRefVal>` and
  `<servicePort>` respectively), and
- propagated to the [`httproute-from-code`](../httproute-from-code/SKILL.md)
  sub-skill in **Step 2.4** so the generated `backendRefs` match.

### Route labels (`routeLabels`) — prefer Step 1 detection

The `metadata.labels` map used by generated HTTPRoutes must be consistent between:

- declarative CR migration output from
  [`core-mesh-crs-to-gatewayapi`](../core-mesh-crs-to-gatewayapi/SKILL.md) **Step 1**,
- Maven-plugin-generated routes in **Step 2.3**, and
- [`httproute-from-code`](../httproute-from-code/SKILL.md) output in **Step 2.4**.

Resolve labels as follows:

1. Capture `Detected output labels` from Step 1 sub-skill output (it also writes
   them to `MIGRATION_LOG.md`).
2. If labels are resolved, treat them as migration-wide `routeLabels`.
3. If labels are unresolved, ask the user for a label map only when first needed
   (Step 2.3 for Java or Step 2.4 otherwise), and record it in the log.
4. Never silently invent label values.

---

## Error policy — read before executing any step

If a step or sub-skill reports an unrecoverable error (non-zero exit code from a
required build command, a sub-skill `ERROR:` section, a file that cannot be
written), apply the following procedure **immediately**:

1. Stop the current step. Do not proceed to the next step.
2. Log the error under **Needs review** with the full error summary, the file or
   command that failed, and a suggested remediation.
3. Print a chat message:
   > ⛔ Step `<N>` failed: `<one-line error>`. Logged under Needs review.
   > Reply **continue** to skip this step and proceed, or **abort** to stop the migration.
4. Wait for the user's reply before taking any further action.

Optional steps (e.g. `mvn -q clean compile` when Maven is not in the environment)
may be skipped without user confirmation; log them under **Skipped** with the
reason.

---

## Migration log — MANDATORY

The skill **must** create and continuously update a migration log at the repo root:

```
MIGRATION_LOG.md
```

The log is the single source of truth for what the automation did. It is updated
**after every step** — never wait until the end. If the log file cannot be
written for any reason, stop immediately and report the failure to the user.

### Logging rules

- **Do:** append concrete file paths, resource names, counts, and commands you ran.
- **Do:** classify every non-trivial action as **Done**, **Skipped**, or **Needs review**.
- **Do:** record every command and its exit code in the **Commands run** table.
- **Do:** echo a short chat summary of the log update after each step
  (`Updated MIGRATION_LOG.md — 3 done, 1 needs review`).
- **Don't:** overwrite the log — always append.
- **Don't:** delete a `Needs review` entry until the user confirms it is resolved.

### What belongs in each bucket

**Structural blockers** — fields or patterns that cannot be auto-converted and
block a correct migration:

| Item | Example location |
|------|-----------------|
| `RouteConfiguration.spec.overridden` non-empty | RouteConfiguration CR |
| `VirtualService.rateLimit` / `.overridden` non-empty | VirtualService CR |
| `RouteDestination.httpVersion` / `.circuitBreaker` / `.tcpKeepalive` non-empty | RouteConfiguration CR |
| `Rule.rateLimit` / `.luaFilter` non-empty | RouteConfiguration CR |
| `Rule.deny` / `.idleTimeout` / `.statefulSession` non-nil | RouteConfiguration CR |
| `FacadeService` with no port defined | FacadeService CR |
| Named `{{- include }}` helpers producing mesh CRs | Helm templates |
| `*` host on an east-west route | Generated HTTPRoute |

**Unknown values** — values the agent cannot safely infer and must not guess:

| Item | Example location |
|------|-----------------|
| Unresolved gateway references | HTTPRoute `parentRefs` |
| Missing microservice name (placeholder `<microservice-name>` in output) | Generated HTTPRoute / `source-code-httproutes.yaml` |
| Ambiguous Java route-registration artifact (webclient vs resttemplate) | `pom.xml` |
| Unknown library versions | `pom.xml` / `go.mod` |

**Done** examples: files wrapped in Core/Istio guards, generated `-istio.yaml`
files, HTTPRoutes emitted from code, Maven plugin added, env var wired, library
versions bumped, `values.yaml` / `values.schema.json` updated, commands that
exited 0.

**Skipped** examples: Maven plugin for a Go-only service, library swap for a
language not present, a step the user explicitly said to defer, optional build
commands not available in the environment.

---

## Execution plan (Step 1 + Step 2 substeps)

Run steps in order. After each step: update the log, record the per-step status
row, and print a one-line chat status.

### Step 1 — Migrate existing mesh CRs to Gateway API CRs

**Idempotency check:** before running, scan `<chart>/templates/` for files
already containing `kind: HTTPRoute` guarded by
`{{- if eq .Values.SERVICE_MESH_TYPE "Istio" }}`. If the full output of this
step already exists, log all affected files under **Done** ("already present")
and skip to Step 1.1.

1. Invoke the sub-skill [`core-mesh-crs-to-gatewayapi`](../core-mesh-crs-to-gatewayapi/SKILL.md)
   with the chart path.
2. That skill will: wrap originals in `SERVICE_MESH_TYPE=Core` guards, generate
   `-istio.yaml` siblings guarded by `SERVICE_MESH_TYPE=Istio`, convert
   `Gateway(ingress/egress)` → Istio Gateway, convert `RouteConfiguration`
   → HTTPRoute, omit `FacadeService` and mesh-type `Gateway` (generates
   east-west HTTPRoutes instead, where parent is of kind Service, processed by
   waypoint proxy), and update `values.yaml` / `values.schema.json`.
3. **If the sub-skill pauses to ask about unresolved gateways** → forward the
   question to the user verbatim, wait for the answer, and resume the sub-skill.
   Log each decision under **Needs review** → move to **Done** once applied.
4. Copy the sub-skill's output summary (modified / generated files, transformed
   resource counts, manual-review list) into the log.
5. **Capture the detected backend reference.** Read the `backendRefName` /
   `backendRefPort` reported in the sub-skill's "Detected backend reference"
   output. If both are resolved, record them in the log (under **Done**) as the
   migration-wide backend reference to reuse in Step 2.3 / Step 2.4. If the
   sub-skill reports them as unresolved, note that they must be asked from the
   user when first needed (see
   [Backend reference](#backend-reference-backendrefname--backendrefport--do-not-ask-up-front)).
6. **Capture the detected labels.** Read the `Detected output labels` map from
   the sub-skill output (and corresponding `MIGRATION_LOG.md` entry). If
   resolved, store it as migration-wide `routeLabels` for Step 2.3 / Step 2.4.
   If unresolved, add a **Needs review** entry and ask user only when labels are
   first needed.

Log update:
- **Done:** every file in `Files modified` and `Files generated`; the detected
  `backendRefName` / `backendRefPort` and `routeLabels` (if resolved).
- **Needs review:** every item from the sub-skill's "Items needing manual review".

**Validation:**
```bash
helm dependency update;
helm template <chart> --set SERVICE_MESH_TYPE=Istio \
  | grep -E 'kind: (HTTPRoute|Gateway)'
```

Expected: the command returns at least one matching line. If it fails, apply the
[Error policy](#error-policy--read-before-executing-any-step).

### Step 1.1 — Log manually handle flagged features

For each `# ⚠ MANUAL REVIEW REQUIRED` comment the sub-skill emitted, add a
**Needs review** entry. **None of these are safe to auto-fix** — they all
require human judgement or a design change. Leave the flag comment in place in
the file; do not remove it.

### Step 2 — Migrate non-declarative routes

Run the following substeps for services that use route-registration libraries or
route-registration annotations. Keep all generated HTTPRoute files committed in
the branch and remind the user to rerun the generation whenever route annotations
or registration code change.

### Step 2.1 — Switch to mesh-type-aware route-registration libraries

Apply only to languages actually present in the repo.

#### Java

**Idempotency check:** for each dependency below, check whether the current
version already satisfies the minimum. If yes, log under **Done** ("already
compliant") and skip that dependency.

- **Spring** (`spring-boot-starter-*` detected in `pom.xml`):
  - Replace old route-posting dependencies with either
    `com.netcracker.cloud:route-registration-webclient` or
    `com.netcracker.cloud:route-registration-resttemplate` at version `>= 7.1.0`.
  - If the project uses `dependencyManagement`, prefer an existing or upgraded
    `com.netcracker.cloud:rest-libraries-bom` at version `>= 7.1.0`, or
    `com.netcracker.cloud:cloud-core-java-bom` at version `>= 12.0.2`, instead
    of adding duplicate explicit dependency versions.
- **Quarkus** (`quarkus-*` detected in `pom.xml`):
  - Replace or add `com.netcracker.cloud.quarkus:routes-registrator` at version
    `>= 9.1.0`.
  - If the project uses `dependencyManagement`, prefer an existing or upgraded
    `com.netcracker.cloud:cloud-core-quarkus-bom-publish` at version `>= 9.1.0`
    instead of adding duplicate explicit dependency versions.
- If the choice between webclient and resttemplate variants is ambiguous, add a
  **Needs review** entry (unknown artifact choice) rather than guessing.

#### Go

**Idempotency check:** read `go.mod` before making any changes.

- In `go.mod`, find `github.com/netcracker/qubership-core-lib-go-rest-utils/v2`.
- If present with version `>= v2.5.0` → log under **Done** ("already compliant"). No changes needed.
- If present with a lower version → bump to at least `v2.5.0`, run
  `go mod tidy`, and record the exit code in **Commands run**. If `go mod tidy`
  exits non-zero, apply the [Error policy](#error-policy--read-before-executing-any-step).
- If absent → do not add it automatically; add a **Needs review** entry:
  "Go route-registration dependency not found — confirm the service does not
  register routes in code."
- If the repo contains a `go.work` file (Go workspace), add a **Needs review**
  entry: "Go workspace (`go.work`) detected — multi-module dependency bumps are
  out of scope for this skill and require manual handling."
- If multiple modules import `rest-utils` at different versions, add a
  **Needs review** entry for each conflicting module.

Log update:
- **Done:** each dependency already compliant or updated; `go mod tidy` exit code.
- **Skipped:** language/framework not present.
- **Needs review:** ambiguous artifact choice, unknown versions, missing
  route-registration dependency, Go workspace, or conflicting module versions.

### Step 2.2 — Set the `SERVICE_MESH_TYPE` environment variable

**Idempotency check:** before editing any file, check whether `SERVICE_MESH_TYPE`
is already present with the correct value and schema entry. If yes, log under
**Done** ("already present") for that file and skip it.

All services that use route registration libraries must receive
`SERVICE_MESH_TYPE`. By default, set Helm values to `Core` for compatibility with
environments where Istio is not installed yet; deployments can override the value
to `Istio` when migrating an environment.

| Deployment source                          | Action                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Helm values drive a `Deployment` template  | Ensure `values.yaml` has `SERVICE_MESH_TYPE: "Core"` and the Deployment `env:` uses `value: '{{ .Values.SERVICE_MESH_TYPE }}'`. |
| `values.schema.json` exists                | Ensure `SERVICE_MESH_TYPE` has a full schema entry: `"type": "string"`, `"enum": ["Istio", "Core"]`, `"default": "Core"`, `"$id": "#/properties/SERVICE_MESH_TYPE"`, `"internal": true`, exact `"description": "Service mesh type. Use `Core` for Cloud Core Mesh or `Istio` for Istio Ambient Mesh."`, and an entry in the root-level `"examples"` array (`{"SERVICE_MESH_TYPE": "Core"}`). Also confirm `"additionalProperties": true` is set at the root. |
| Plain Kubernetes `Deployment` manifest     | Add `- name: SERVICE_MESH_TYPE` with `value: Core`, or template it if the manifest is Helm-rendered. |

Log under **Done** the exact files edited. If multiple Deployments exist, list
each. If the desired runtime mesh for an environment is unclear, keep the default
`Core` and add a **Needs review** entry telling the user where to set `Istio`.

### Step 2.3 — Add the Maven plugin (Java services only)

**Idempotency check:** if `httproutes-generator-maven-plugin` is already present
in `pom.xml`, log under **Done** ("already present") and skip to Step 2.4.

- **If no `pom.xml`** → skip this step. Log under **Skipped**
  ("No pom.xml found — Go-only service").
- **If the Java service does not use route-registration annotations** → skip this
  step and log the reason.
- **If `pom.xml` exists and annotations are used**, follow these five sub-steps
  (from the [plugin README](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-core-java-libs/blob/main/core-maven-plugins/httproutes-generator-maven-plugin/README.md)):
  1. **Add plugin to `pom.xml`** with the following configuration:
     - `<groupId>com.netcracker.cloud.plugins</groupId>`
     - `<artifactId>httproutes-generator-maven-plugin</artifactId>`
     - `<version>` must use the latest available release, but never lower than
       `1.0.2` (`>= 1.0.2`).
     - `<goal>generate-routes</goal>`
     - `<packages>` resolved from `src/main/java/...`. If ambiguous, set
       `com.example` and add a **Needs review** entry.
     - `<servicePort>` set to the resolved **`backendRefPort`** — detected by
       Step 1, or asked from the user here (default `8080`) if Step 1 did not
       resolve it. Do not silently re-read `server.port`.
     - `<outputFile>` pointing inside the chart templates directory, defaulting
       to `<chart>/templates/annotations-httproutes.yaml`.
     - `<backendRefVal>` set to the resolved **`backendRefName`** — detected by
       Step 1, or asked from the user here (default
       `{{ .Values.DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME }}`) if Step 1 did not resolve it,
       e.g. `<backendRefVal>{{ .Values.DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME }}</backendRefVal>`.
     - `<labels>` set to resolved migration-wide `routeLabels` from Step 1. If
       Step 1 labels are unresolved, ask user for the label map and use it
       verbatim. Do not invent values.
       Use Maven plugin label format:
       `<labels><label><key>my/special-key</key><value>value1</value></label></labels>`.
  2. **Confirm `<outputFile>`** is set to a path inside the Helm chart templates
     directory (see above). This file must be committed to the branch.
  3. **Build the project** to generate the output file. Run `mvn -q clean process-classes`
     if Maven is available in the environment. Record the exit code in
     **Commands run**. If Maven is not available, log under **Skipped**
     ("mvn not available in environment") and continue. If Maven is available
     but exits non-zero, apply the
     [Error policy](#error-policy--read-before-executing-any-step).
  4. **Commit the generated `<outputFile>`** to the branch. Remind the user:
     > The plugin generates the output file at compile time. Every time route
     > annotations change, run `mvn clean compile` locally and commit the updated
     > output file before raising a PR.
  5. Log the selected plugin version and committed file path under **Done**.

Log update:
- **Done:** `pom.xml` edited; `mvn -q clean process-classes` exit code (if run); generated
  output file path committed.
- **Skipped:** non-Java service, no route-registration annotations, or Maven
  not available in the environment.
- **Needs review:** any default value that could not be confirmed from project
  files (`<packages>`). `<servicePort>` / `<backendRefVal>` come from the
  `backendRefPort` / `backendRefName` resolved in Step 1 (or asked from the
  user) and do not need review.

### Step 2.4 — Generate HTTPRoute CRs from route registration code

**Idempotency check:** if `source-code-httproutes.yaml` already exists and its
content matches what the sub-skill would generate (no source-code changes since
last run), log under **Done** ("already present") and skip.

1. Invoke sub-skill [`httproute-from-code`](../httproute-from-code/SKILL.md) with
   the source-code path **and** the resolved `backendRefName` / `backendRefPort`
   (detected by Step 1, or asked from the user if still unresolved — propose the
   defaults `{{ .Values.DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME }}` / `8080`). The sub-skill uses
   these for every generated `backendRefs[].name` / `backendRefs[].port` so the
   code-generated routes match the Maven-plugin output from Step 2.3.
   Also pass migration-wide `routeLabels` (detected in Step 1 or provided by user)
   so every generated HTTPRoute uses the same labels as declarative and plugin
   generated routes.
2. That skill scans Go (`*.go`) and Java (`*.java`) files, extracts
   `routeregistration.Route` / `RouteEntry` definitions, groups by `RouteType`,
   and emits one HTTPRoute CR per type to
   `helm-templates/<service name>/templates/source-code-httproutes.yaml`.
3. **If the sub-skill fell back to `<microservice-name>` as the service name:**
   - Do **not** leave the file with the literal placeholder in place — it will
     break `helm template` silently.
   - Rename the output file to `source-code-httproutes.yaml.incomplete` and add
     a prominent comment at the top: `# INCOMPLETE: replace <microservice-name>
     before committing`.
   - Add a **Needs review** entry: "Microservice name could not be resolved —
     file renamed to `.incomplete`; set the correct name and rename before
     merging."
4. Do not make any inference for `source-code-httproutes.yaml` - besides what `httproute-from-code` skill does. 
5. **Commit all generated files** to the branch. Remind the user:
   > The generated `source-code-httproutes.yaml` must stay committed. Any time
   > route registration code changes, rerun the `httproute-from-code` skill and
   > commit the updated output before raising a PR.
6. Copy the sub-skill's summary table into the log.
7. For every row where `Skipped = yes` or the skill emitted an `ERROR:` section,
   add a **Needs review** entry.

### Step 2.5 — Verify all HTTPRoutes are wrapped in Istio conditionals

**Idempotency check:** if all HTTPRoute files already have the correct guard,
log under **Done** ("already guarded") for each and skip to validation.

1. List every file under `<chart>/templates/` (and any generated
   `-istio.yaml` / `source-code-httproutes.yaml`) that contains
   `kind: HTTPRoute`.
2. For each file, confirm the HTTPRoute block is inside a single
   `{{- if eq .Values.SERVICE_MESH_TYPE "Istio" }}` … `{{- end }}`. If a file
   has multiple HTTPRoute documents, the guard must wrap the whole block with
   `---` separators kept inside.
3. If a file is missing the guard → add it (safe automatic fix). Log under
   **Done**.

**Validation:**

```bash
helm dependency update && helm template <chart> --set SERVICE_MESH_TYPE=Core \
  | grep 'kind: HTTPRoute'
```

Expected output: empty (no HTTPRoutes leak under Core mode). Record the command
and exit code in **Commands run**.
- Empty output → log under **Done**.
- Any HTTPRoute lines in output → log each offending file path under
  **Needs review** and apply the
  [Error policy](#error-policy--read-before-executing-any-step).

### Step 2.6 — Detect duplicate HTTPRoute rules

After all HTTPRoutes exist (Step 1 conversions + Step 2.3 annotations +
Step 2.4 code generation), the same route can be emitted twice — e.g. a route
declared in a `RouteConfiguration` CR **and** registered in code. Duplicate
rules with the same parent and identical match are ambiguous and **must not be
auto-removed** (deleting the wrong one can change runtime behaviour). Flag them
for the user instead.

**Idempotency check:** if a previous run already logged the duplicate-rule
findings and no HTTPRoute files changed since, log under **Done**
("already checked") and skip.

1. Collect every HTTPRoute rule across all generated/modified files guarded by
   `SERVICE_MESH_TYPE=Istio` (`-istio.yaml`, `annotations-httproutes.yaml`,
   `source-code-httproutes.yaml`, and any inline HTTPRoutes).
2. For each rule, build a comparison key from:
   - the **parent** — every `parentRefs[]` entry it belongs to
     (`group` + `kind` + `name`), and
   - the **match parameters** — the normalized `matches[]`: path `type` + `value`,
     plus any `headers[]` / `queryParams[]` / `method`.
   Resolve `{{ .Values.* }}` expressions textually (compare the literal template
   string); do not attempt to render Helm.
3. A **duplicate** is two or more rules that share **at least one common parent**
   AND have an **equal match key**. Rules that share a match but target only
   different parents are NOT duplicates.
4. For every duplicate group, add **one Needs review** entry containing:
   - the shared parent(s) and the match value,
   - every file + HTTPRoute `metadata.name` (and rule index) that contributes a
     copy,
   - suggested action: "Two routes resolve to the same parent and match —
     confirm which source is authoritative and remove the redundant rule (often
     a route present both in a `RouteConfiguration` CR and in registration
     code)."
5. **Do not modify any file.** This step only reports.
6. If no duplicates are found → log under **Done** ("no duplicate HTTPRoute
   rules detected").

Log update:
- **Done:** "duplicate-rule scan complete — N groups found" (or none).
- **Needs review:** one entry per duplicate group (see above).

## Final checklist and hand-off

Before declaring the migration complete, produce a **Final report** that mirrors
the "Final Checklist" in the migration guide. Mark `[x]` only when the step has
at least one **Done** entry and zero unresolved **Needs review** entries:

```markdown
## Final report

- [x/ ] Existing mesh CRs converted to HTTPRoute CRs
- [x/ ] Flagged features from Step 1.1 resolved
- [x/ ] Mesh-aware libraries replace old route-posting libraries
- [x/ ] SERVICE_MESH_TYPE set in Helm values / Deployment
- [x/ ] Maven plugin added and local build passes (Java only)
- [x/ ] HTTPRoute CRs generated from route registration code
- [x/ ] All HTTPRoute CRs wrapped in the Istio conditional
- [x/ ] HTTPRoutes scanned for duplicate rules (same parent + equal match)

Open items (require user review):
- <list all remaining "Needs review" entries from MIGRATION_LOG.md>
```

Close with a plain-language summary telling the user:

1. **What was applied automatically** (reference the Done section count).
2. **What was skipped and why** (reference the Skipped section).
3. **What requires careful human review before merging** (enumerate the Needs
   review section, highlighting structural blockers that could change runtime
   behaviour — `RouteConfiguration.spec.overridden`,
   `rateLimit`, `VirtualService.overridden`, `*` hosts on east-west routes,
   `RouteDestination` / `httpVersion` / `circuitBreaker` /
   `tcpKeepalive`, `Rule.deny`, `Rule.statefulSession`,
   `Rule.idleTimeout`, `Rule.luaFilter`, `FacadeService` with no port,
   unresolved gateways, helper-produced CRs, placeholder library versions,
   duplicate HTTPRoute rules from Step 2.6 (same parent + equal match), and
   any `.incomplete` files from Step 2.4).
4. The recommended validation commands the user should run locally before pushing:

   ```bash
   # Must return at least one HTTPRoute or Gateway line
   helm template <chart> --set SERVICE_MESH_TYPE=Istio \
     | grep -E 'kind: (HTTPRoute|Gateway)'

   # Must return nothing — HTTPRoutes must not leak under Core mode
   helm template <chart> --set SERVICE_MESH_TYPE=Core \
     | grep 'kind: HTTPRoute'
   ```

## Operating rules

- **Never skip the log.** If the log file cannot be written, stop and report.
- **Never invent values.** Versions, package names, ports, microservice names —
  if unknown, add a **Needs review** entry instead of guessing.
- **Never bypass a sub-skill's user prompt.** If `core-mesh-crs-to-gatewayapi` asks
  about an unresolved gateway, forward the question before proceeding.
- **Never run destructive commands.** Do not push, tag, or delete branches. Do
  not modify git config.
- **Be explicit in chat.** After each step, print a one-line summary plus the
  updated per-step status row.
- **Idempotent reruns.** Each step begins with an explicit idempotency check
  (described inline). If the step's outputs are already in place and correct,
  log them as **Done** ("already present") and move on without re-applying changes.
- **Follow the Error policy.** On any unrecoverable failure, stop the step, log
  it, and ask the user whether to continue or abort before taking further action.

## Non-goals

This skill only modifies:
Helm templates, `values.yaml`, `values.schema.json`, `pom.xml`, `go.mod`,
and `MIGRATION_LOG.md`.

It does not raise pull requests, push branches, rewrite application logic, or
modify git configuration.
