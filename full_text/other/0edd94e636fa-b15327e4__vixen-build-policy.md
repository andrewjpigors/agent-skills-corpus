description: Use before dispatching a VIXEN build (build.bat, cmake --build) on Windows, or when deciding whether to wait/queue/do other work while a build is in flight. Covers the machine-wide build lock, the FIFO registration/notification queue, and why a slower-but-throttled build beats maximum parallelism. Triggers on "run the build", "let's build", "is a build running", "build.bat", "cmake --build vixen-ninja".

# VIXEN Build Policy

## Overview

VIXEN builds on Windows go through `build.bat` at the repo root
(`/mnt/c/cpp/VBVS--VIXEN/build.bat`), which drives three layered pieces of tooling under
`VIXEN/scripts/build/` — a machine-wide **lock** (only one build runs at a time), a
**parallelism cap** (a running build doesn't peg every core), and a **FIFO queue with
notification** (an agent can register intent to build, go do other work, and check back only
when it's actually their turn). All three exist because of one incident: concurrent/unthrottled
builds pegged every core and stalled every agent's work on this machine — see
`Vixen-Docs/04-Development/Worktree-Build-Artifact-Accumulation-Audit-2026-07.md` Fix 7-10 for
the full incident history, measurements, and the bugs found while building this.

**Platform scope**: this whole policy is Windows-PowerShell-only (the lock is a .NET
`System.Threading.Mutex`, a Win32 kernel object with no equivalent semantics on Linux/WSL). A
WSL-side build (e.g. undertow's `cmake --build vixen/build`, invoked directly with no wrapper)
is NOT coordinated by any of this — it's a separate, unlocked build lane by design, not an
oversight. Don't assume cross-platform safety.

## Building a single target instead of everything

`build.bat` takes an optional third argument: a CMake target name. Omit it to build the full
default graph (as before); pass it to scope the build to one target (and its dependencies) —
e.g. iterating on one library or test binary without paying to rebuild+relink the rest of the
graph:

```bash
cmd.exe /c "C:\cpp\VBVS--VIXEN\build.bat build vixen-ninja VixenApp"
```

This threads through as `cmake --build --preset <preset> --target <name> -- -k 0 -j <N>` —
same lock, same parallelism caps, same `-k 0`/FAILED-summary behavior, just scoped to that
target's subgraph. Calling `run_build_with_summary.ps1` directly, the flag is `-Target <name>`.
**`VixenApp` (shown above) is a library target, not the executable** — it's the right scope for a
compile-only iteration loop, but it does NOT relink `VIXEN.exe`; see the `VixenApp`-only-relinks-
the-static-lib gotcha below before using this if you actually intend to RUN the result.

## The three layers

1. **`run_build_with_summary.ps1`** (called by `build.bat build`/`build.bat all`) — acquires
   the lock (`Global\VixenBuildLock`), runs `cmake --build --preset <preset> -- -k 0 -j
   <MaxParallelJobs>`, releases the lock in a `finally` (so a killed build can never wedge it —
   unlike a lockfile, a Mutex is auto-released by the OS if its owning process dies). Writes a
   live status file (`%TEMP%\vixen_build_status.txt`) every 5s: `VIXEN_BUILD_STATUS`
   (`WAITING_FOR_LOCK`/`RUNNING`/`DONE`), `targets_done`/`targets_total`/`targets_failed`,
   `last_target`, `elapsed_seconds`. Prints a `BUILD SUMMARY` at the end listing every `FAILED:`
   target by path — `-k 0` means ONE broken target never masks whether everything else built.
2. **`check_build_lock.ps1`** — a non-blocking peek (`WaitOne(0)`) at whether the lock is
   currently held. Exit 0 + "FREE", or exit 1 + "HELD". Use this BEFORE deciding to register or
   dispatch, so you don't queue behind a build you didn't know was running.
3. **`build_queue.ps1`** — FIFO registration on top of the lock (see "Queue and notification"
   below). This is the layer that lets you avoid blocking a whole turn on a synchronous wait.

## The core policy: don't dispatch blind, don't wait blind

**Before dispatching a build you expect to take more than a minute or two:**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File VIXEN\scripts\build\check_build_lock.ps1
```

- **FREE** → just call `build.bat build` (or `all`). It will acquire the lock itself; no
  further action needed.
- **HELD** → **don't dispatch a competing build.** It will just block synchronously inside
  `run_build_with_summary.ps1`'s `WaitOne()`, holding your whole turn/process idle with zero
  visibility into how long that wait will be. Register in the queue instead (below), then go
  do something else.

**While a build is queued or running, stay ACTIVE — do not go idle.** If you have other useful
work to interleave (docs, code review, planning the next phase), do it between status checks.
But the wait itself must be driven by an active foreground poll loop on the ~20s cadence below,
never a background wakeup/idle wait — see "Queue and notification" for why. This is the same
principle as the `multi-worktree-sync` skill's build-traffic-control section — this skill is
the VIXEN-specific implementation of it.

## Queue and notification: register, poll actively, go on your turn

Use this instead of directly calling `build.bat` when the lock is held, or whenever you want
fair ordering + visibility instead of a blind synchronous wait.

```powershell
# 1. Register — cheap, instant, non-blocking. Prints your TicketId and queue position.
# De-duplicated by the COMBINATION of (AgentId, Source, BuildTarget) — not AgentId alone. A
# retry/duplicate dispatch of the SAME agent registering the SAME source+target again gets
# back the SAME existing ticket, not a second one. But the same agent building a DIFFERENT
# target, or from a DIFFERENT worktree/source, is a distinct, valid request and gets its own
# new ticket — appended at the BACK of the queue behind everyone already waiting, never ahead.
# Pass -Source as something stable per requester (e.g. your worktree name) and -BuildTarget as
# whatever you'll pass to build.bat's target arg (omit for a full/default build) so de-dup can
# actually distinguish your requests correctly.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File VIXEN\scripts\build\build_queue.ps1 -Register -AgentId "<your-agent-id>" -Source "<your-worktree-name>" -BuildTarget "<target-or-omit-for-full-build>" -Note "<why you're building>"

# 2. Poll -Status actively every ~20s (see below) until YOUR_TURN. Do NOT hand the wait off to
#    ScheduleWakeup or a background Monitor task and go idle — those have repeatedly failed to
#    reliably wake the agent back up on this machine, silently stalling the whole turn.

# 3. Check status (repeat in the active ~20s loop until YOUR_TURN):
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File VIXEN\scripts\build\build_queue.ps1 -Status -TicketId <id>
#   YOUR_TURN        -> position 1 AND the lock is free. Call build.bat now.
#   WAITING          -> not your turn yet (either not position 1, or position 1 but the lock
#                        is still held by an in-flight build — these are reported distinctly).
#   UNKNOWN_TICKET    -> your ticket expired (see Reap below), was released, or never existed.

# 4. Release is AUTOMATIC once build.bat actually starts the build (see below) — you do not
#    need to call -Release yourself in that case. Only call it explicitly if you registered a
#    ticket and then decided NOT to build after all (so nothing else will ever release it):
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File VIXEN\scripts\build\build_queue.ps1 -Release -TicketId <id>
```

`-ListQueue` shows the whole queue (position, agent, note, registration time) plus current
lock state — useful for a human or an orchestrating agent to see who's waiting.

**Ticket release is automatic, not dependent on the dispatching agent staying alive.** Pass
your ticket through to the actual build via the `VIXEN_QUEUE_TICKET_ID` env var:

```bash
VIXEN_QUEUE_TICKET_ID=<id> cmd.exe /c "C:\...\build.bat build vixen-ninja"
```

`run_build_with_summary.ps1` releases that ticket itself, in the same `finally` block that
releases the build-lock Mutex — so release is tied to the **build process's own lifetime**, not
to whether the agent that registered it is still around afterward to call `-Release`. This
closes a real gap: previously a ticket was only ever released by the dispatching agent calling
`-Release` after `build.bat` returned, so an agent that got killed, crashed, or had its context
cleared mid-build left its ticket blocking the queue until the 60-minute stale reap. Now the
build itself — success, failure, or crash — always clears it. `run_build_with_summary.ps1` also
writes the outcome to `%TEMP%\vixen_build_queue_results\<TicketId>.log` (exit code, failed
targets, path to the full build log) so a *different* agent, or the same agent resumed later,
can read what happened without having stayed attached to watch it happen.

You should still call `-Release` explicitly in the one case auto-release doesn't cover:
registering a ticket and then deciding not to build at all.

**Notification mechanism, concretely — active polling, NOT `ScheduleWakeup`/`Monitor`.**
`ScheduleWakeup` and background-task notifications have repeatedly failed to reliably wake an
agent back up on this machine — an agent that goes idle waiting on one is liable to just stay
idle, silently stalling the whole turn with no one watching. Do not rely on them for a build
wait. Instead, poll `-Status` from an **active foreground loop directly in the same turn**, on
a ~20 second interval, per the standing rule in CLAUDE.md for any long-running
build/configure/render/deploy: never a silent `sleep`/blind wait, always a loop that prints a
readable status line each iteration so both the user and the agent's own process stay live and
attentive. Concretely, something like:

```bash
while true; do
  out=$(powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File VIXEN\scripts\build\build_queue.ps1 -Status -TicketId <id>)
  echo "[queue] $out"
  echo "$out" | grep -q YOUR_TURN && break
  sleep 20
done
```

This is a real foreground command (or the harness's Monitor/until-loop equivalent driving the
same query), not a background task — the agent stays active and re-checks every ~20s rather
than parking on a wakeup that may never fire. Only reach for a longer interval if a build is
already known to run long (Fix 8: real builds run 1-3+ minutes even mostly-cached) AND the
agent is deliberately doing other useful work in parallel between checks — the default,
un-supervised wait is always the ~20s active loop.

**Ticket hygiene — liveness-based reaping (fixed 2026-07-11), not just age.** Tickets are files
under `%TEMP%\vixen_build_queue\`, not tied to a process lifetime the way the Mutex is — a
crashed/killed agent's ticket does NOT auto-release. Every ticket has a `LastSeenUtc` field,
refreshed on every `-Register` (dedup-hit) and `-Status` call for that ticket — i.e. every time
its owner actually checks in. Reaping compares `LastSeenUtc`, NOT registration age: a
genuinely active waiter polling `-Status` every ~20s (per the active-polling rule above) never
goes stale no matter how long it legitimately waits, while an abandoned ticket (agent crashed,
shut down without releasing, or a one-off registration that was never followed by a build or
any `-Status` poll) goes stale within `-StaleMinutes` (default **15**, down from an earlier 60)
of its last real check-in. **`-Status` also opportunistically reaps its own blocking ticket
inline** the moment it discovers it's stuck behind a stale one — not just on the next periodic
sweep — so a real waiter is never stuck behind an abandoned ticket for the full stale window.
This closes a real incident (2026-07-11): a validator agent self-registered a ticket for an
ad-hoc verification build (outside the `build.bat`-auto-release path — see below), then shut
down without releasing it, stranding a sibling agent's real build behind it until manually
released. **Still always call `-Release` yourself when you're truly done** rather than relying
on staleness reaping — reaping is the backstop for abandonment, not the primary release path.

## Auto-dispatch — recommended default for the queue path (2026-07-12)

Liveness reaping (above) stops an abandoned ticket from blocking the queue forever, but it
doesn't make the WANTED build actually happen — if you register, then stall (context
exhaustion, a stuck subagent, anything short of a clean shutdown) before your ticket reaches
the front and you personally call `build.bat`, your build never runs; your ticket just
eventually goes stale and gets reaped, same outcome as if you'd never registered at all.

**Fix: pass `-BuildScript` at `-Register` time and the queue dispatches your build FOR you —
you don't have to be present or responsive when your turn comes.**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File VIXEN\scripts\build\build_queue.ps1 -Register `
    -AgentId "<your-agent-id>" -Source "<your-worktree-name>" -BuildTarget "<target-or-omit>" `
    -BuildScript "C:\cpp\VBVS--VIXEN\.claude\worktrees\<your-worktree>\build.bat" `
    -BuildAction all -BuildPreset vixen-ninja -Note "<why you're building>"
```

`-BuildScript` MUST be the full absolute Windows path to YOUR worktree's own `build.bat` (same
"always use the absolute path" rule as everywhere else in this skill — get it via `wslpath -w
"$(pwd)/build.bat"`). `-BuildAction`/`-BuildPreset` default to `all`/`vixen-ninja` if omitted.

Once registered this way, **any agent's routine `-Status` or `-ListQueue` call** — not just
yours — will notice when your ticket reaches position 1 with the lock free, and run your build
right there before returning, then release your ticket automatically. This piggybacks on
polling traffic that's already happening across the whole agent fleet (per the active-polling
rule), so your build fires as soon as ANY other agent's normal, unrelated queue check touches
the queue, even if you yourself never poll again. No new persistent watcher process — nothing
new to babysit or that can itself silently die.

Your own `-Status -TicketId <id>` call will report one of two NEW outcomes once dispatch
happens:
- `AUTO_DISPATCHED` (exit 0) — your build ran (possibly as part of this very `-Status` call, or
  earlier via someone else's) and succeeded. Ticket already released, nothing more to do.
- `AUTO_DISPATCH_FAILED` (exit 4) — your build ran and failed (non-zero exit). Ticket is STILL
  released (a failed turn is still a completed turn, not a reason to keep blocking everyone
  behind it) — check your own build log (same log path/BuildId system as always) for what went
  wrong, same as a manually-dispatched failure always required.

**Always pass `-BuildScript` when you register — treat manual (no `-BuildScript`) as an explicit,
narrow opt-out, not a normal choice.** This isn't just a preference: a manual ticket that
finishes its build but never calls `-Release` (the common case — an agent builds, moves on to
its next step, and simply forgets) has NO self-healing path the way an auto-dispatch ticket
does. Auto-dispatch tickets clean themselves up the instant any agent's routine poll finds them
at position 1 — an abandoned manual ticket just sits there blocking every real waiter behind it
for the full staleness window (up to 15 min) even once its build has visibly, provably already
finished. Observed live (2026-07-12, Sampled Lighting Inc3 M5): a manual ticket blocked a
queued waiter for real wall-clock time after its own build had already completed — root cause
was simply "forgot to pass `-QueueTicketId` through to `build.bat`, so the self-release path
never fired." `build_queue.ps1` now ALSO opportunistically reaps a manual ticket once its own
build is provably `DONE` (matches the shared status file's `build_id` to the ticket's
`AgentId`, registered after the ticket) — a safety net, not a reason to keep defaulting to
manual. Only skip `-BuildScript` for the one case it's actually for: reserving a queue position
without ever intending to build (e.g. a validator just checking whether the lock will be free
soon) — and even then, call `-Release` yourself the moment you're done, don't rely on staleness
or the safety-net reap.

## Why parallelism is capped, not maximized (Fix 10)

`run_build_with_summary.ps1` passes `-j <N>` to ninja, defaulting to ~75% of logical cores
(override: `-MaxParallelJobs` or `VIXEN_MAX_BUILD_JOBS` env var). Separately, `CMakeLists.txt`
caps concurrent **link** jobs specifically, lower still (`(cores+3)/4` — 4 on a 16-core
machine, override: `VIXEN_MAX_PARALLEL_LINKS`), via a Ninja job pool
(`CMAKE_JOB_POOL_LINK`). Two different caps because compile and link have different resource
profiles here: link.exe for this project's debug binaries (with `/Z7` embedded debug info)
runs 400-500MB RSS each — running as many links in parallel as cores is what actually made the
whole machine stutter under load, not the compile step. A build that leaves the machine
usable is worth more than a build that finishes 20% faster while everything else on the
machine (including other agents) grinds to a halt.

## Env vars (all optional, all have conservative defaults)

| Var | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `VIXEN_SKIP_BUILD_LOCK` | unset | Set to `1` to bypass the lock entirely (e.g. a machine known to be otherwise idle) |
| `VIXEN_BUILD_LOCK_TIMEOUT` | 1800 (30 min) | Seconds to wait for the lock before giving up |
| `VIXEN_MAX_BUILD_JOBS` | ~75% of logical cores | Overall ninja `-j` cap |
| `VIXEN_MAX_PARALLEL_LINKS` | `(cores+3)/4` | Concurrent link-job cap (separate, lower) |

## Known worktree gotcha: always invoke `build.bat` by absolute Windows path

`build.bat` derives its source directory from its own location (`REPO_ROOT=%~dp0`,
`SRC_DIR=%REPO_ROOT%\VIXEN`) — this is correct BY DESIGN so the same script works from any
clone/worktree. The failure mode is upstream of that: if you invoke it from a WSL bash shell via
`cmd.exe /c "build.bat build vixen-ninja"` (a bare relative name, no explicit path) while your
bash `cwd` is inside a worktree, `cmd.exe`'s OWN starting directory is not guaranteed to be your
bash `cwd` — cross-shell invocation can silently resolve `build.bat` against a DIFFERENT
`build.bat` on `PATH`/a stale default directory (observed: it resolved to the main checkout's
`C:\cpp\VBVS--VIXEN\build.bat` while running from a worktree at
`.claude\worktrees\<name>\`). The build then runs, acquires the lock, and reports success/failure
— all against the WRONG tree, with no error, because `build.bat` has no way to know it was asked
to build somewhere other than intended. This burned a full build-lock turn (and a second one
finding the fix "already applied" on the wrong checkout) on 2026-07-11 during Sampled-Lighting
Inc3 M1.

**Always call `build.bat` with its full Windows absolute path** when driving it from WSL bash,
even though the script itself is path-agnostic:

```bash
cmd.exe /c "C:\cpp\VBVS--VIXEN\.claude\worktrees\<your-worktree>\build.bat build vixen-ninja" > log 2>&1
```

not:

```bash
cmd.exe /c "build.bat build vixen-ninja" > log 2>&1   # DON'T — cwd/PATH resolution is not guaranteed
```

Get the absolute Windows path from bash with `wslpath -w "$(pwd)/build.bat"` if unsure. **After
any build, sanity-check the logged `source:` line** (`run_build_with_summary.ps1` prints
`[build] source   : <path>` near the top of every run) — if it doesn't match the worktree you
meant to build, the whole result (including a "target now builds!" fix-verification) is
meaningless, silently.

## Known gotcha: `VIXEN/binaries/VIXEN.exe` was a stale, unlinked copy (FIXED 2026-07-11)

`VIXEN/binaries/` (source-tree, gitignored) and `CMAKE_BINARY_DIR/binaries` (the REAL build
output, e.g. `build/ninja/binaries/`) are two different directories, and CMake never copied
between them before 2026-07-11 — a `POST_BUILD` step (`VIXEN/application/main/CMakeLists.txt`)
now mirrors the fresh `VIXEN.exe` into `VIXEN/binaries/` on every build, alongside the existing
TBB-DLL copy. **Before this fix**, every hand-rolled capture `.bat` script that ran the relative
path `binaries\VIXEN.exe` from `VIXEN_ROOT` (the established pattern across this repo's demo/gate
scripts) was silently reading whichever copy was last placed there by hand — independent of
whether the actual build was fresh. This produced at least one false "byte-identical" capture
result (Inc3 M8 Task 21, 2026-07-11) before being caught. If you're on a checkout from before this
fix landed, or writing a NEW capture script, don't assume `VIXEN\binaries\VIXEN.exe` is current —
either confirm this `POST_BUILD` step exists in the CMakeLists you're building against, or run
directly from `$<TARGET_FILE_DIR:VIXEN>` (the real build output dir) instead of the source-tree
copy.

## Known gotcha: concurrent CONFIGURE steps raced on the shared FetchContent cache (FIXED 2026-07-12)

The machine-wide build lock (`Global\VixenBuildLock`) only ever wrapped the BUILD step. `build.bat`'s
`configure`/`all` actions called `cmake --preset <name>` directly, with NO lock at all — but CMake's
`FetchContent_Populate` (clone/update/"recompaction" — an internal stamp-file rewrite) runs during
CONFIGURE, and `FETCHCONTENT_BASE_DIR` is deliberately ONE shared directory
(`C:/vixen-fetchcontent-cache`) across every worktree on this machine (see `VIXEN/CMakeLists.txt`'s
"share FetchContent's clone+build output across all worktrees" block). Two worktrees configuring at
the same moment could both write into the SAME shared subbuild (e.g. `glm-build`, `nlohmann_json-src`)
unserialized — CMake's own stamp-file rewrite isn't safe against two concurrent writers, so whichever
process lost the race got a raw Windows **"Permission denied"** (the other process still had the file
open/mid-rename). It appeared to move between different dependencies build-to-build (glm, then
nlohmann_json, ...) because it was whichever two configures happened to overlap on that PARTICULAR
sub-project at that moment — not a defect in any one library. Observed live 2026-07-12: 3 concurrent
agents (`view-binding-inc-c`, `ki-020-017-fix`, `lazy-baseline-inc0`) each hit this on different
FetchContent subbuilds within the same ~15-minute window, each burning a retry.

**Fixed:** a SEPARATE, narrower machine-wide Mutex, `Global\VixenConfigureLock`
(`VIXEN/scripts/build/run_configure_locked.ps1`), now wraps the `cmake --preset` call for BOTH
`build.bat configure` and `build.bat all` — same auto-release-on-process-death guarantee as the build
lock, same `VIXEN_BUILD_LOCK_TIMEOUT`/`VIXEN_SKIP_BUILD_LOCK` env vars (one pair of knobs governs both
locks). **Deliberately a separate lock from the build one**, not folded into it: configure (fast, often
just seconds once FetchContent is already populated) must not queue behind another worktree's
multi-minute BUILD, and the two phases contend on genuinely different resources (the shared `_deps`
directory vs. CPU/IO during compile/link) — sharing one lock would only cost concurrency for no safety
gain. The two locks are never held simultaneously by one process (configure lock is released before the
build lock is ever acquired), so this cannot deadlock. Verified live: two simultaneous `run_configure_
locked.ps1` invocations against the SAME checkout — the first acquired immediately, the second logged
"waiting for the machine-wide configure lock" and acquired only after the first released, no overlap.

**Practical implication:** if you ever see a raw `Permission denied` failure during a CMake CONFIGURE
step (not a compile/link `FAILED:` target) on a FetchContent subbuild, and it's NOT reproducible on a
clean re-run alone, suspect a concurrent configure on another worktree — check whether this fix is
present in the checkout you're building (pre-2026-07-12 checkouts still call `cmake --preset` unlocked
from `build.bat`).

## Known gotcha: an invalid `-Target`/`-BuildTarget` used to silently report success (FIXED 2026-07-12)

Before this fix, `run_build_with_summary.ps1` inferred success/failure from the background job's
`JobStateInfo.State` (`'Failed'` vs `'Completed'`) — but that only reflects a terminating
PowerShell-level error inside the job, not the actual exit code of the `cmake`/`ninja` process it
ran. An invalid target name (`ninja: error: unknown target 'foo'`) makes `cmake --build` exit
non-zero immediately, with **zero** per-target `FAILED:` lines in the log (nothing was ever
attempted) — so both success checks (`State`, and `$failedTargets.Count -gt 0`) came back clean,
and the script printed **"All targets built successfully."** with exit 0, even though nothing
built. This bit a real case: a `-BuildTarget` value meant only as a descriptive queue-registration
label (not an actual CMake target) was passed straight through to `--target`, and the auto-dispatch
path reported `AUTO_DISPATCHED`/success on a build that never compiled anything.

**Fixed:** the job scriptblock now returns `$LASTEXITCODE` (the real `cmake`/`ninja` exit code) as
its result; the script reads that via `Receive-Job` instead of trusting `JobStateInfo.State` alone.
A non-zero exit with no per-target `FAILED:` lines is now reported distinctly — **"BUILD INVOCATION
FAILED (exit N) BEFORE any target's compile/link was attempted"** — instead of being folded into
the "all clean" case. Verified against three cases: a bogus target (now correctly reports
invocation-failure + exit 1), a real scoped-target success (still exit 0), and a real per-target
compile failure (still reports the `FAILED:` list + exit 1, unaffected by this fix).

**Practical implication:** `-BuildTarget`/`-Target` must be a real CMake target name, never a
free-text label — if you want to describe *why* you're building, use `-Note`, not `-BuildTarget`.

## Known gotcha: the shared status file is machine-wide, not per-build (mitigated by BuildId)

`%TEMP%\vixen_build_status.txt` (`run_build_with_summary.ps1`'s live-status file) is a SINGLE
file shared by every build on the machine — it is overwritten by whichever build last touched it,
regardless of which worktree/agent started it. If two agents build around the same time, checking
this file for "is MY build done" can show a stale or entirely different build's `last_target`
(e.g. a path under a DIFFERENT worktree). Observed 2026-07-11: after my own build finished, the
status file's `last_target` pointed at `tiered-esvo-inc2` — a sibling agent's build that happened
to finish around the same moment.

**Fixed (2026-07-11): every build now has a `BuildId`**, printed as the FIRST line of console
output, written into the status file as a `build_id:` field, embedded in the log filename
itself (`%TEMP%\vixen_build_<BuildId>.log` — no more anonymous random-GUID logs), and repeated
in the BUILD SUMMARY footer. `build.bat` auto-derives a sensible default from the checkout's own
directory name (a worktree's builds are self-identifying with zero setup — e.g. `build.bat` run
from `.claude\worktrees\graph-node-linkage-inc1\` gets `BuildId=graph-node-linkage-inc1`), or set
`VIXEN_BUILD_ID=<something>` explicitly for a more specific label (e.g. a task/ticket name).
**Always check the status file's `build_id:` field against the BuildId you noted at dispatch
time before trusting `last_target`/`targets_done` as "my build's" progress** — if it doesn't
match, you're looking at a different, possibly-concurrent build's status, not yours. This makes
the status file usable for "is MY build done" now, not just "is the lock currently busy" — but
your own build's log (`%TEMP%\vixen_build_<YourBuildId>.log`, printed at both start and end of
output) remains the authoritative source for full output/failures, same as before.

## What NOT to do

- Don't call `cmake --build` directly, bypassing `build.bat` — you skip the lock, the
  parallelism caps, AND the `-k 0` keep-going behavior, reintroducing exactly the problems
  Fix 7-10 fixed. If you need a scoped/target-specific build, still go through
  `run_build_with_summary.ps1` (it accepts the same preset-based `cmake --build` underneath;
  don't hand-roll a separate invocation).
- Don't poll `-Status`/`check_build_lock.ps1` in a sub-second tight loop that wastes cycles —
  but DO poll actively on a ~20s cadence (see "Queue and notification" above). Don't hand the
  wait off to `ScheduleWakeup` or a background `Monitor` task and go idle instead — those have
  repeatedly failed to reliably resume the agent on this machine, which stalls the whole turn
  with nothing watching it. An active 20s foreground loop is the correct middle ground.
- Don't assume the lock/queue coordinates with a WSL-side build (undertow or otherwise) — it
  doesn't, by design (see Platform scope above).
- Don't manually call `-Release` after a build you dispatched via `VIXEN_QUEUE_TICKET_ID` —
  `run_build_with_summary.ps1` already released it in its `finally` block; calling `-Release`
  again is harmless (idempotent — "already released") but unnecessary. DO still call `-Release`
  yourself if you registered a ticket and decided not to build at all — nothing else will ever
  release that one.
- **Three separate release paths now exist — know which one applies to your ticket.** (1)
  Auto-dispatch (`-BuildScript` passed at `-Register`): the queue itself runs your build and
  releases the ticket, no action from you ever needed. (2) `VIXEN_QUEUE_TICKET_ID` passed to a
  manually-invoked `build.bat`: `run_build_with_summary.ps1` releases it when that build
  finishes. (3) Neither of the above (a bare reservation ticket): YOU must call `-Release`
  yourself, or rely on liveness-staleness reaping as the last-resort backstop. Don't assume (1)
  or (2) apply to a ticket you registered as a bare reservation — check which flags you actually
  passed at `-Register` time.
- **`build.bat build` does NOT reconfigure — it never re-runs `cmake --preset`.** Only
  `build.bat all`/`configure` does. If you ADD A NEW SOURCE FILE to a `CMakeLists.txt` (a new
  `.cpp`/`.h` registered in a target's source list) and then call `build.bat build`, ninja's
  existing `build.ninja` has no idea the new file exists — it silently rebuilds/relinks whatever
  it already knew about and calls it done, exit 0, no error. The resulting binary does NOT
  contain your new file, and any gate/capture run against it is a **false pass** — it "succeeds"
  precisely because none of your new code is in the binary being tested. This bit a real gate
  (Sampled-Lighting Inc3 M2, 2026-07-11): an Opus validator caught it via build-graph forensics —
  the new file's `.obj` didn't exist, the target `.lib`/`.exe` timestamps predated the source
  edit by tens of minutes, and a `grep` for the new symbol found zero occurrences in the built
  artifacts, even though the gate had reported byte-identical/clean results. **Rule: whenever
  your milestone adds or removes a source file from any `CMakeLists.txt`, run `build.bat all`
  (or `configure` then `build`) at least once before trusting any gate capture — `build.bat
  build` alone is only safe for iterating on EXISTING files.** When validating someone else's
  gate, spot-check this yourself: compare the new/changed source file's mtime against the
  target binary's mtime, and grep the binary (or its `.lib`) for a symbol/string unique to the
  new code — don't just trust that "the build succeeded."
- **Always invoke the WORKTREE's own `build.bat`, not the repo-root/main-checkout's.** Each git
  worktree has its own copy of `build.bat` at its own root — if you `cd` or path-reference the
  wrong one (e.g. accidentally the main checkout's `/mnt/c/cpp/VBVS--VIXEN/build.bat` while
  meaning to build a worktree's source), you silently build/gate the WRONG tree's code. This
  also bit the same M2 validation session. Double-check the absolute path you invoke resolves
  inside the worktree you actually intend to build.
- **Scoping a build to `VixenApp` only relinks the STATIC LIBRARY, never `VIXEN.exe`.** `VixenApp`
  is a `.lib` target that the real executable target (`VIXEN`, `application/main/CMakeLists.txt:
  add_executable(VIXEN ...)`) links against — `build.bat build vixen-ninja VixenApp` builds and
  relinks only that lib; ninja has no reason to also relink `VIXEN.exe` unless something else in
  the same invocation asks for it. The build reports success (exit 0, "Linking ... VixenApp.lib")
  and LOOKS like it did the job, but the actual binary you'd go on to run/gate is untouched — same
  false-pass shape as the missing-reconfigure gotcha above, just via a different mechanism (wrong
  scoped target, not a stale ninja graph). Caught 2026-07-13 (Sampled-Lighting Cornell-demo M1):
  an implementer burned a full run+capture cycle before noticing the linked binary's mtime
  predated the just-recompiled `.obj`. **Rule: when you need the actual executable rebuilt
  (anything you're about to RUN, not just compile-check), target `VIXEN` (or omit the target
  argument entirely to build everything), never `VixenApp` alone.** `VixenApp` is still the right
  scope for a compile-only iteration loop on library code with no intent to run the result yet.
