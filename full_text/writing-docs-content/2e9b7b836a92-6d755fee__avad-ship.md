# Ship: Validate, Review, and Ship

You are running the `/ship` workflow. This is **automated by default** — run straight through
and output the PR URL at the end.

**Only stop for:**
- Being on a protected branch (ask user: create work branch / commit directly / abort)
- Merge conflicts that can't be auto-resolved (show conflicts)
- Validation failures (show failures)
- Pre-landing review ASK items that need user judgment
- Cannot discover target branch or test commands (ask once)

**Never stop for:**
- Commit message wording (auto-compose)
- PR body content (auto-generate)
- Auto-fixable review findings (dead code, N+1, stale comments — fixed automatically)
- Test coverage gaps (auto-generate and commit, or flag in PR body)

---

## Safety Check

Before anything else, check if you are on a known protected branch:

```bash
branch=$(git branch --show-current)
```

If `$branch` is `main` or `master`, use **AskUserQuestion** with options:
- **A) Create a work branch** — move changes to a new branch and continue shipping
- **B) Commit on `<branch>` directly** — bypass branch protection rule
- **C) Abort** — stop shipping

This prevents accidentally committing onto a protected branch while still giving the user control.

---

## Step 0: Read Project Configuration

Read `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`.

### If `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md` exists:

Read it. Extract everything you need:
- **Target branch** (e.g. `dev`, `main`)
- **Protected branches** and their protection levels
- **Branch naming** conventions and allowed prefixes
- **Merge strategy** (squash, merge commit, rebase)
- **Commit message format** (Conventional Commits, scopes, etc.)
- **PR requirements** (CI checks, approvals, CODEOWNERS)
- **Version numbering** scheme (if any)

Also read:
- `CLAUDE.md` — for **test/lint/typecheck commands**
- `AGENTS.md` — for **domain rules** (canonical values, API whitelist, etc.)
- `~/.avadbot/projects/<repo>/review-checklist.md` — for **pre-landing review checklist** (if it exists)

### If `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md` does NOT exist:

Generate it. Read the project's available context to infer the workflow:

1. **Scan for signals:**
   - `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` — rules, commands, conventions
   - `git log --oneline -20` — commit message style, branch merge patterns
   - `git branch -r` — what remote branches exist
   - `git config pull.rebase` — merge vs rebase preference
   - `pyproject.toml` / `package.json` / `Cargo.toml` / `go.mod` — language and tooling
   - `.github/workflows/` — CI configuration

2. **Ask the user key questions** (one AskUserQuestion, all at once):
   - What is your target integration branch? (e.g. `dev`, `main`)
   - Do you use squash merge, merge commits, or rebase?
   - Any branch naming conventions?
   - Any required CI checks before merge?

3. **Generate `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`** covering:
   - Branch structure (diagram + table of branches and their purpose)
   - Workflow steps (create branch → commit → push → PR)
   - Commit message format with project-specific scopes
   - Merge strategy per PR type
   - Protected branches and their rules
   - Version numbering (if applicable)
   - Agent-specific rules (what agents must/must not do)

4. **Write the file but do NOT commit yet.**
   Step 1 must validate the branch first. The file will be committed
   in Step 7 along with other changes (or on its own if there are no other changes).

   This file persists — future `/ship` runs read it directly.

---

## Step 1: Pre-flight

1. Run `git status --short --branch` (never use `-uall`).

2. Confirm the current branch is a valid work branch:
   - Must NOT be a protected branch (as defined in `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`)
   - Must follow the branch naming conventions from `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`
   - If on a protected branch, use **AskUserQuestion** with options:
     - **A) Create a work branch** — move changes to a new branch (e.g. `chore/description`) and continue shipping
     - **B) Commit on `<branch>` directly** — bypass branch protection rule
     - **C) Abort** — stop shipping

3. Check for uncommitted changes:
   - If there are uncommitted changes, auto-recommend an option based on context:
     - **Recommend "Stage and include"** when: changed files are in the same area as
       branch commits (same directories/modules), OR the branch has no prior commits
       yet (all work is uncommitted)
     - **Recommend "Stash and exclude"** when: changed files are unrelated to the
       branch's commit history (different directories/modules)
     - **Recommend "Delete and discard"** when: files are clearly throwaway (e.g. `test.md`
       in root with no meaningful content, temp debug files, scratch files)
   - Use **AskUserQuestion** with options (mark the recommended option with `(Recommended)`):
     - **A) Stage and include** — changes are related to this branch's work
     - **B) Stash and exclude** — changes are unrelated, stash them before shipping
     - **C) Delete and discard** — files are throwaway, delete them before shipping
     - **D) Show me the changes** — display the diff so I can decide
   - If user picks A: stage all and continue
   - If user picks B: `git stash push -u -m "ship: stashed unrelated changes"` and continue
   - If user picks C: delete the throwaway files (`rm <files>`) and continue
   - If user picks D: show `git diff` and `git status`, then re-ask A/B/C

4. **Detect already-merged branches:**

   ```bash
   git ls-remote --heads origin <branch>
   git diff --stat origin/<target>...HEAD
   ```

   If the branch does NOT exist on remote AND the diff against `<target>` is empty
   (all commits already upstream), the branch was already merged and deleted.

   In this case, check for uncommitted changes:
   - **If uncommitted changes exist:** use **AskUserQuestion** with options:
     - **A) Move to a new branch** — create a new branch from `origin/<target>` with these changes
     - **B) Abort** — stop shipping
   - **If no uncommitted changes:** report "Branch already merged via PR. Nothing to ship." and **stop**.

   Do NOT offer "Commit and ship as-is" — the branch is dead, pushing to it would
   recreate a branch for a closed PR.

5. Confirm the branch represents one logical change only.
   If the branch history mixes unrelated work, stop and require splitting.

6. Review the shipment scope:

   ```bash
   git diff --stat origin/<target>...HEAD
   git log --oneline origin/<target>..HEAD
   ```

7. **Check review readiness:**

   ```bash
   SLUG=$(basename "$(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null)" .git 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
   BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current | tr '/' '-')
   cat ~/.avadbot/projects/$SLUG/$BRANCH-reviews.jsonl 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_REVIEWS"
   ```

   Parse the output. Find the most recent entry for each skill (plan-ceo-review, plan-eng-review,
   plan-design-review, design-review-lite). Ignore entries with timestamps older than 7 days. Display:

   ```
   +====================================================================+
   |                    REVIEW READINESS DASHBOARD                       |
   +====================================================================+
   | Review          | Runs | Last Run            | Status    | Required |
   |-----------------|------|---------------------|-----------|----------|
   | Eng Review      |  1   | 2026-03-16 15:00    | CLEAR     | YES      |
   | CEO Review      |  0   | —                   | —         | no       |
   | Design Review   |  0   | —                   | —         | no       |
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | VERDICT: CLEARED — Eng Review passed                                |
   +====================================================================+
   ```

   **Review tiers:**
   - **Eng Review (required by default):** The only review that gates shipping. Covers architecture,
     code quality, tests, performance.
   - **CEO Review (optional):** Use your judgment. Recommend it for big product/business changes,
     new user-facing features, or scope decisions. Skip for bug fixes, refactors, infra, and cleanup.
   - **Design Review (optional):** Use your judgment. Recommend it for UI/UX changes. Skip for
     backend-only, infra, or prompt-only changes.

   **Verdict logic:**
   - **CLEARED**: Eng Review has >= 1 entry within 7 days with status "clean"
   - **NOT CLEARED**: Eng Review missing, stale (>7 days), or has open issues
   - CEO and Design reviews are shown for context but never block shipping

   **If Eng Review is NOT "CLEAR":**

   1. **Check for a prior override on this branch:**
      ```bash
      grep '"skill":"ship-review-override"' ~/.avadbot/projects/$SLUG/$BRANCH-reviews.jsonl 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_OVERRIDE"
      ```
      If an override exists, display the dashboard and note "Review gate previously accepted — continuing."
      Do NOT ask again.

   2. **If no override exists,** use AskUserQuestion:
      - Show that Eng Review is missing or has open issues
      - RECOMMENDATION: Choose C if the change is obviously trivial (< 20 lines, typo fix, config-only);
        Choose B for larger changes
      - Options:
        A) Ship anyway
        B) Abort — run /avad-plan-eng-review first
        C) Change is too small to need eng review
      - If CEO Review is missing, mention as informational ("CEO Review not run — recommended for
        product changes") but do NOT block
      - If Design Review is missing and the diff touches frontend files (CSS/HTML/JSX/TSX/view files),
        mention: "Design Review not run — this PR changes frontend code. Consider running /avadbot:avad-review
        with design checks." Still never block.

   3. **If the user chooses A or C,** persist the decision so future `/ship` runs on this branch
      skip the gate:
      ```bash
      mkdir -p ~/.avadbot/projects/$SLUG
      echo '{"skill":"ship-review-override","timestamp":"'"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"'","decision":"USER_CHOICE"}' >> ~/.avadbot/projects/$SLUG/$BRANCH-reviews.jsonl
      ```
      Substitute USER_CHOICE with "ship_anyway" or "not_relevant".

---

## Step 2: Sync with Target Branch

Use the integration strategy defined in `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`:

```bash
git fetch origin

# If GIT_WORKFLOW.md specifies rebase:
git rebase --autostash origin/<target>

# If GIT_WORKFLOW.md specifies merge (or no preference):
git merge origin/<target> --no-edit
```

If conflicts appear:
- Auto-resolve trivial mechanical conflicts (whitespace, ordering)
- If conflicts are ambiguous or affect behavior, **stop** and show them

If already up to date, continue silently.

---

## Step 2.5: Post-Sync Gate — STOP if branch is dead

**This is a hard gate. Do NOT continue past this step if the branch has no diff.**

After rebase/merge, verify the branch still has changes:

```bash
git diff --stat origin/<target>...HEAD
```

If the diff is **not empty**, continue to Step 3.

If the diff is **empty** (all commits were dropped as already-upstream), the branch
is dead — it was already merged. **STOP** and follow one of these paths:

1. **If uncommitted changes exist** (e.g. from autostash): use **AskUserQuestion**:
   - **A) Move to a new branch** — create a new branch from `origin/<target>` with
     these changes and restart `/ship` from Step 1
   - **B) Abort** — stop shipping

2. **If no uncommitted changes exist:**
   Report "All branch commits already upstream. Nothing to ship." and **stop**.

Do NOT continue shipping on the dead branch. Do NOT push it. Do NOT create a PR from it.
Pushing a dead branch recreates a branch for a closed PR.

This gate catches cases where Step 1 pre-flight didn't detect the merged state (e.g. the
branch still existed on remote when Step 1 ran, but rebase revealed all content was upstream).

---

## Step 2.75: Test Framework Bootstrap

**Detect existing test framework and project runtime:**

```bash
# Detect project runtime
[ -f Gemfile ] && echo "RUNTIME:ruby"
[ -f package.json ] && echo "RUNTIME:node"
[ -f requirements.txt ] || [ -f pyproject.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:python"
[ -f go.mod ] && echo "RUNTIME:go"
[ -f Cargo.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:rust"
[ -f composer.json ] && echo "RUNTIME:php"
[ -f mix.exs ] && echo "RUNTIME:elixir"
# Detect sub-frameworks
[ -f Gemfile ] && grep -q "rails" Gemfile 2>/dev/null && echo "FRAMEWORK:rails"
[ -f package.json ] && grep -q '"next"' package.json 2>/dev/null && echo "FRAMEWORK:nextjs"
# Check for existing test infrastructure
ls jest.config.* vitest.config.* playwright.config.* .rspec pytest.ini pyproject.toml phpunit.xml 2>/dev/null
ls -d test/ tests/ spec/ __tests__/ cypress/ e2e/ 2>/dev/null
# Check opt-out marker
[ -f .avadbot/no-test-bootstrap ] && echo "BOOTSTRAP_DECLINED"
```

**If test framework detected** (config files or test directories found):
Print "Test framework detected: {name} ({N} existing tests). Skipping bootstrap."
Read 2-3 existing test files to learn conventions (naming, imports, assertion style, setup patterns).
Store conventions as prose context for use in Step 3.5 test generation. **Skip the rest of bootstrap.**

**If BOOTSTRAP_DECLINED** appears: Print "Test bootstrap previously declined — skipping." **Skip the rest of bootstrap.**

**If NO runtime detected** (no config files found): Use AskUserQuestion:
"I couldn't detect your project's language. What runtime are you using?"
Options: A) Node.js/TypeScript B) Ruby/Rails C) Python D) Go E) Rust F) PHP G) Elixir H) This project doesn't need tests.
If user picks H → write `.avadbot/no-test-bootstrap` and continue without tests.

**If runtime detected but no test framework — bootstrap:**

### B2. Research best practices

Use WebSearch to find current best practices for the detected runtime:
- `"[runtime] best test framework 2025 2026"`
- `"[framework A] vs [framework B] comparison"`

If WebSearch is unavailable, use this built-in knowledge table:

| Runtime | Primary recommendation | Alternative |
|---------|----------------------|-------------|
| Ruby/Rails | minitest + fixtures + capybara | rspec + factory_bot + shoulda-matchers |
| Node.js | vitest + @testing-library | jest + @testing-library |
| Next.js | vitest + @testing-library/react + playwright | jest + cypress |
| Python | pytest + pytest-cov | unittest |
| Go | stdlib testing + testify | stdlib only |
| Rust | cargo test (built-in) + mockall | — |
| PHP | phpunit + mockery | pest |
| Elixir | ExUnit (built-in) + ex_machina | — |

### B3. Framework selection

Use AskUserQuestion:
"I detected this is a [Runtime/Framework] project with no test framework. I researched current best practices. Here are the options:
A) [Primary] — [rationale]. Includes: [packages]. Supports: unit, integration, smoke, e2e
B) [Alternative] — [rationale]. Includes: [packages]
C) Skip — don't set up testing right now
RECOMMENDATION: Choose A because [reason based on project context]"

If user picks C → write `.avadbot/no-test-bootstrap`. Tell user: "If you change your mind later, delete `.avadbot/no-test-bootstrap` and re-run." Continue without tests.

If multiple runtimes detected (monorepo) → ask which runtime to set up first, with option to do both sequentially.

### B4. Install and configure

1. Install the chosen packages (npm/bun/gem/pip/etc.)
2. Create minimal config file
3. Create directory structure (test/, spec/, etc.)
4. Create one example test matching the project's code to verify setup works

If package installation fails → debug once. If still failing → revert with `git checkout -- package.json package-lock.json` (or equivalent for the runtime). Warn user and continue without tests.

### B4.5. First real tests

Generate 3-5 real tests for existing code:

1. **Find recently changed files:** `git log --since=30.days --name-only --format="" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10`
2. **Prioritize by risk:** Error handlers > business logic with conditionals > API endpoints > pure functions
3. **For each file:** Write one test that tests real behavior with meaningful assertions. Never `expect(x).toBeDefined()` — test what the code DOES.
4. Run each test. Passes → keep. Fails → fix once. Still fails → delete silently.
5. Generate at least 1 test, cap at 5.

Never import secrets, API keys, or credentials in test files. Use environment variables or test fixtures.

### B5. Verify

```bash
# Run the full test suite to confirm everything works
{detected test command}
```

If tests fail → debug once. If still failing → revert all bootstrap changes and warn user.

### B5.5. CI/CD pipeline

```bash
# Check CI provider
ls -d .github/ 2>/dev/null && echo "CI:github"
ls .gitlab-ci.yml .circleci/ bitrise.yml 2>/dev/null
```

If `.github/` exists (or no CI detected — default to GitHub Actions):
Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` with:
- `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`
- Appropriate setup action for the runtime (setup-node, setup-ruby, setup-python, etc.)
- The same test command verified in B5
- Trigger: push + pull_request

If non-GitHub CI detected → skip CI generation with note: "Detected {provider} — CI pipeline generation supports GitHub Actions only. Add test step to your existing pipeline manually."

### B6. Create TESTING.md

First check: If TESTING.md already exists → read it and update/append rather than overwriting. Never destroy existing content.

Write TESTING.md with:
- Framework name and version
- How to run tests (the verified command from B5)
- Test layers: Unit tests (what, where, when), Integration tests, Smoke tests, E2E tests
- Conventions: file naming, assertion style, setup/teardown patterns

### B7. Update CLAUDE.md

First check: If CLAUDE.md already has a `## Testing` section → skip. Don't duplicate.

Append a `## Testing` section:
- Run command and test directory
- Reference to TESTING.md
- Test expectations:
  - When writing new functions, write a corresponding test
  - When fixing a bug, write a regression test
  - When adding error handling, write a test that triggers the error
  - When adding a conditional (if/else, switch), write tests for BOTH paths
  - Never commit code that makes existing tests fail

### B8. Commit

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

Only commit if there are changes. Stage all bootstrap files (config, test directory, TESTING.md, CLAUDE.md, .github/workflows/test.yml if created):
`git commit -m "chore: bootstrap test framework ({framework name})"`

---

## Step 3: Run Validation

Run all discovered test/lint/type-check commands **in parallel** where possible.

Use a unique temp directory to avoid collisions with concurrent runs,
and capture exit codes explicitly:

```bash
_land_tmp=$(mktemp -d)

(set -o pipefail; <test-cmd> 2>&1 | tee "$_land_tmp/tests.txt"; echo $? > "$_land_tmp/tests.exit") &
(set -o pipefail; <lint-cmd> 2>&1 | tee "$_land_tmp/lint.txt"; echo $? > "$_land_tmp/lint.exit") &
(set -o pipefail; <typecheck-cmd> 2>&1 | tee "$_land_tmp/types.txt"; echo $? > "$_land_tmp/types.exit") &
wait
```

After all complete, check each `*.exit` file. If any contains a non-zero code,
show that command's output and **stop**.

Rules:
- If any command fails, show the failures and **stop**
- If all pass, note the counts briefly and continue
- Capture output — it goes into the PR body
- **Always clean up `$_land_tmp`** — run `rm -rf "$_land_tmp"` before any exit,
  whether validation passed, failed, or the workflow stops for any reason.
  Since the agent runs individual shell commands (not a script), `trap` does not
  persist between calls. Instead, run the cleanup explicitly before stopping.

If the project has no test commands, warn the user and continue.

---

## Step 3.5: Test Coverage Audit

100% coverage is the goal — every untested path is a path where bugs hide and vibe coding becomes yolo coding. Evaluate what was ACTUALLY coded (from the diff), not what was planned.

### Test Framework Detection

Before analyzing coverage, detect the project's test framework:

1. **Read CLAUDE.md** — look for a `## Testing` section with test command and framework name. If found, use that as the authoritative source.
2. **If CLAUDE.md has no testing section, auto-detect:**

```bash
# Detect project runtime
[ -f Gemfile ] && echo "RUNTIME:ruby"
[ -f package.json ] && echo "RUNTIME:node"
[ -f requirements.txt ] || [ -f pyproject.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:python"
[ -f go.mod ] && echo "RUNTIME:go"
[ -f Cargo.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:rust"
# Check for existing test infrastructure
ls jest.config.* vitest.config.* playwright.config.* cypress.config.* .rspec pytest.ini phpunit.xml 2>/dev/null
ls -d test/ tests/ spec/ __tests__/ cypress/ e2e/ 2>/dev/null
```

3. **If no framework detected:** falls through to the Test Framework Bootstrap step (Step 2.75) which handles full setup.

**0. Before/after test count:**

```bash
# Count test files before any generation
find . -name '*.test.*' -o -name '*.spec.*' -o -name '*_test.*' -o -name '*_spec.*' | grep -v node_modules | wc -l
```

Store this number for the PR body.

**1. Trace every codepath changed** using `git diff origin/<base>...HEAD`:

Read every changed file. For each one, trace how data flows through the code — don't just list functions, actually follow the execution:

1. **Read the diff.** For each changed file, read the full file (not just the diff hunk) to understand context.
2. **Trace data flow.** Starting from each entry point (route handler, exported function, event listener, component render), follow the data through every branch:
   - Where does input come from? (request params, props, database, API call)
   - What transforms it? (validation, mapping, computation)
   - Where does it go? (database write, API response, rendered output, side effect)
   - What can go wrong at each step? (null/undefined, invalid input, network failure, empty collection)
3. **Diagram the execution.** For each changed file, draw an ASCII diagram showing:
   - Every function/method that was added or modified
   - Every conditional branch (if/else, switch, ternary, guard clause, early return)
   - Every error path (try/catch, rescue, error boundary, fallback)
   - Every call to another function (trace into it — does IT have untested branches?)
   - Every edge: what happens with null input? Empty array? Invalid type?

This is the critical step — you're building a map of every line of code that can execute differently based on input. Every branch in this diagram needs a test.

**2. Map user flows, interactions, and error states:**

Code coverage isn't enough — you need to cover how real users interact with the changed code. For each changed feature, think through:

- **User flows:** What sequence of actions does a user take that touches this code? Map the full journey (e.g., "user clicks 'Pay' → form validates → API call → success/failure screen"). Each step in the journey needs a test.
- **Interaction edge cases:** What happens when the user does something unexpected?
  - Double-click/rapid resubmit
  - Navigate away mid-operation (back button, close tab, click another link)
  - Submit with stale data (page sat open for 30 minutes, session expired)
  - Slow connection (API takes 10 seconds — what does the user see?)
  - Concurrent actions (two tabs, same form)
- **Error states the user can see:** For every error the code handles, what does the user actually experience?
  - Is there a clear error message or a silent failure?
  - Can the user recover (retry, go back, fix input) or are they stuck?
  - What happens with no network? With a 500 from the API? With invalid data from the server?
- **Empty/zero/boundary states:** What does the UI show with zero results? With 10,000 results? With a single character input? With maximum-length input?

Add these to your diagram alongside the code branches. A user flow with no test is just as much a gap as an untested if/else.

**3. Check each branch against existing tests:**

Go through your diagram branch by branch — both code paths AND user flows. For each one, search for a test that exercises it:
- Function `processPayment()` → look for `billing.test.ts`, `billing.spec.ts`, `test/billing_test.rb`
- An if/else → look for tests covering BOTH the true AND false path
- An error handler → look for a test that triggers that specific error condition
- A call to `helperFn()` that has its own branches → those branches need tests too
- A user flow → look for an integration or E2E test that walks through the journey
- An interaction edge case → look for a test that simulates the unexpected action

Quality scoring rubric:
- ★★★  Tests behavior with edge cases AND error paths
- ★★   Tests correct behavior, happy path only
- ★    Smoke test / existence check / trivial assertion (e.g., "it renders", "it doesn't throw")

### E2E Test Decision Matrix

When checking each branch, also determine whether a unit test or E2E/integration test is the right tool:

**RECOMMEND E2E (mark as [→E2E] in the diagram):**
- Common user flow spanning 3+ components/services (e.g., signup → verify email → first login)
- Integration point where mocking hides real failures (e.g., API → queue → worker → DB)
- Auth/payment/data-destruction flows — too important to trust unit tests alone

**RECOMMEND EVAL (mark as [→EVAL] in the diagram):**
- Critical LLM call that needs a quality eval (e.g., prompt change → test output still meets quality bar)
- Changes to prompt templates, system instructions, or tool definitions

**STICK WITH UNIT TESTS:**
- Pure function with clear inputs/outputs
- Internal helper with no side effects
- Edge case of a single function (null input, empty array)
- Obscure/rare flow that isn't customer-facing

### REGRESSION RULE (mandatory)

**IRON RULE:** When the coverage audit identifies a REGRESSION — code that previously worked but the diff broke — a regression test is written immediately. No AskUserQuestion. No skipping. Regressions are the highest-priority test because they prove something broke.

A regression is when:
- The diff modifies existing behavior (not new code)
- The existing test suite (if any) doesn't cover the changed path
- The change introduces a new failure mode for existing callers

When uncertain whether a change is a regression, err on the side of writing the test.

Format: commit as `test: regression test for {what broke}`

**4. Output ASCII coverage diagram:**

Include BOTH code paths and user flows in the same diagram. Mark E2E-worthy and eval-worthy paths:

```

─────────────────────────────────
```

**Fast path:** All paths covered → "Step 3.5: All new code paths have test coverage." Continue.

**5. Generate tests for uncovered paths:**

If test framework detected (or bootstrapped in Step 2.75):
- Prioritize error handlers and edge cases first (happy paths are more likely already tested)
- Read 2-3 existing test files to match conventions exactly
- Generate unit tests. Mock all external dependencies (DB, API, Redis).
- For paths marked [→E2E]: generate integration/E2E tests using the project's E2E framework (Playwright, Cypress, Capybara, etc.)
- For paths marked [→EVAL]: generate eval tests using the project's eval framework, or flag for manual eval if none exists
- Write tests that exercise the specific uncovered path with real assertions
- Run each test. Passes → commit as `test: coverage for {feature}`
- Fails → fix once. Still fails → revert, note gap in diagram.

Caps: 30 code paths max, 20 tests generated max (code + user flow combined), 2-min per-test exploration cap.

If no test framework AND user declined bootstrap → diagram only, no generation. Note: "Test generation skipped — no test framework configured."

**Diff is test-only changes:** Skip Step 3.5 entirely: "No new application code paths to audit."

**6. After-count and coverage summary:**

```bash
# Count test files after generation
find . -name '*.test.*' -o -name '*.spec.*' -o -name '*_test.*' -o -name '*_spec.*' | grep -v node_modules | wc -l
```

For PR body: `Tests: {before} → {after} (+{delta} new)`
Coverage line: `Test Coverage Audit: N new code paths. M covered (X%). K tests generated, J committed.`

### Test Plan Artifact

After producing the coverage diagram, write a test plan artifact so `/avad-qa` can consume it:

```bash
SLUG=$(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null | sed 's|.*[:/]\([^/]*/[^/]*\)\.git$|\1|;s|.*[:/]\([^/]*/[^/]*\)$|\1|' | tr '/' '-')
mkdir -p ~/.avadbot/projects/$SLUG
USER=$(whoami)
DATETIME=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

Write to `~/.avadbot/projects/{slug}/{user}-{branch}-ship-test-plan-{datetime}.md`:

```markdown
# Test Plan
Generated by /avad-ship on {date}
Branch: {branch}
Repo: {owner/repo}

## Affected Pages/Routes
- {URL path} — {what to test and why}

## Key Interactions to Verify
- {interaction description} on {page}

## Edge Cases
- {edge case} on {page}

## Critical Paths
- {end-to-end flow that must work}
```

---

## Step 4: Determine Targeted Validation (Conditional)

If the repository defines a validation matrix (in governing docs or CLAUDE.md),
check which areas are affected:

```bash
git diff --name-only origin/<target>...HEAD
```

Run any additional area-specific checks beyond the general test suite.
Examples: migration validation, contract tests, idempotency checks.

Skip this step if no validation matrix is defined.

---

## Step 5: Pre-Landing Review

Review the diff for structural issues that tests don't catch.

```bash
git diff origin/<target>...HEAD
```

Always use three-dot diff (`...`) — this shows only your branch's changes since
divergence, not changes on the target branch.

### Step 5.0: Load or Generate Checklist

**If a project-specific checklist exists** (`~/.avadbot/projects/<repo>/review-checklist.md`):
read it and use it.

**If no checklist exists**, generate one before proceeding:

1. Read the project's governing docs, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and scan the codebase
   structure to understand:
   - Language and framework (Python/Django, Rails, Node/React, Go, etc.)
   - Database type and access patterns (raw SQL, ORM, migrations)
   - External APIs used and their constraints
   - Domain-specific rules (canonical values, idempotency requirements, etc.)
   - Security boundaries (auth, tokens, user input handling)

2. Read `../avad-review/checklist-seed.md` and use it as the bootstrap taxonomy.
   Adapt it before writing anything:
   - keep only categories that matter to this repo
   - rename categories to match the project's actual architecture and vocabulary
   - add project-specific categories and suppressions from docs and code
   - never copy the seed verbatim as the final checklist
   - no code transforms the seed; the agent reads it as context and synthesizes
     the final project-specific checklist

3. Generate `~/.avadbot/projects/<repo>/review-checklist.md` following this structure:

   ```markdown
   # Pre-Landing Review Checklist

   ## Instructions

   Review the diff for the issues listed below. Be specific — cite `file:line`
   and suggest fixes. Skip anything that's fine. Only flag real problems.

   **Two-pass review:**
   - **Pass 1 (CRITICAL):** Run critical categories first. These block `/ship`.
   - **Pass 2 (INFORMATIONAL):** Run remaining categories. Included in PR body
     but do not block.

   **Output format:**

   Pre-Landing Review: N issues (X critical, Y informational)

   **CRITICAL** (blocking):
   - [file:line] Problem description
     Fix: suggested fix

   **Issues** (non-blocking):
   - [file:line] Problem description
     Fix: suggested fix

   If no issues found: `Pre-Landing Review: No issues found.`

   Be terse. One line problem, one line fix. No preamble.

   ---

   ## Pass 1 — CRITICAL

   <generate 2-4 critical categories based on the project's actual risks>

   ## Pass 2 — INFORMATIONAL

   <generate 3-6 informational categories based on the project's patterns>

   ---

   ## Suppressions — DO NOT flag these

   <generate 3-5 suppression rules to reduce false positives>
   ```

4. Start from the seed file, but the final categories must be **derived from the project**, not generic boilerplate.
   Examples of how project signals map to checklist items:

   | Project signal | → Critical category |
   |---|---|
   | Raw SQL / migrations dir | SQL injection, parameterized queries |
   | `AGENTS.md` lists canonical values | Vocabulary drift |
   | Insert-only / upsert patterns | Idempotency regressions |
   | API key / OAuth in auth module | Secrets in tracked files |
   | Rate limit handling in code | Rate limit safety |

   | Project signal | → Informational category |
   |---|---|
   | Architecture doc with contracts | Schema drift from contracts |
   | Endpoint whitelist | Unauthorized endpoint usage |
   | Migration files present | Editing applied migrations |
   | Test directory exists | Test gaps for new code paths |

5. Write the file to `~/.avadbot/projects/<repo>/review-checklist.md` and continue.
   This file persists — future `/ship` runs will use it directly.

### Step 5.1: Apply the Checklist (Fix-First)

1. Apply it in two passes:
   - **Pass 1 (CRITICAL):** blocking categories
   - **Pass 2 (INFORMATIONAL):** non-blocking — include in PR body

2. **Classify each finding as AUTO-FIX or ASK** using the Fix-First Heuristic:

   **AUTO-FIX** (fix without asking — mechanical, low-risk):
   - Dead code, unused imports, unused variables
   - Stale comments that reference removed code
   - N+1 query patterns with obvious eager-load fix
   - Missing null checks where the fix is clear
   - Obvious typos in strings or identifiers
   - Style violations (formatting, naming conventions)
   - Missing error logging where pattern is established

   **ASK** (needs user judgment — ambiguous or high-risk):
   - Security concerns (auth, input validation, secrets)
   - Race conditions or concurrency issues
   - Design decisions (API shape, data model, architecture)
   - Performance tradeoffs with no obvious winner
   - Changes that affect public API or contracts
   - Anything where two reasonable engineers would disagree

   Critical findings lean toward ASK; informational lean toward AUTO-FIX.

3. **Auto-fix all AUTO-FIX items.** Apply each fix. Output one line per fix:
   `[AUTO-FIXED] [file:line] Problem → what you did`

4. **If ASK items remain,** present them in ONE AskUserQuestion:
   - List each with number, severity, problem, recommended fix
   - Per-item options: A) Fix  B) Skip
   - Overall RECOMMENDATION
   - If 3 or fewer ASK items, you may use individual AskUserQuestion calls instead

5. **After all fixes (auto + user-approved):**
   - If ANY fixes were applied: commit fixed files (`git add <fixed-files> && git commit -m "fix: pre-landing review fixes"`), then **re-run validation (Step 3)** to confirm fixes don't break anything. If validation passes, continue. If it fails, stop.
   - If no fixes applied (all ASK items skipped, or no issues found): continue.

6. Output summary: `Pre-Landing Review: N issues — M auto-fixed, K asked (J fixed, L skipped)`

   If no issues found: `Pre-Landing Review: No issues found.`

---

## Step 5.5: TODOS.md Auto-Update

Read `TODOS.md` in the repo root. If it doesn't exist, skip this step silently.

If it exists:

1. **Detect completed items:** Scan the diff and commit history for work that closes open TODOs.
   Match conservatively — only mark items done when the diff clearly resolves the TODO's **What** description.

2. **Move completed items** to the `## Completed` section, preserving original content and appending:
   ```markdown
   **Completed:** vX.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)
   ```

3. **Check structure:** Verify items follow the format in `avad-review/TODOS-format.md`
   (What/Why/Context/Effort/Priority). Do not rewrite existing items — only flag malformed ones
   as informational.

4. If any items were moved to Completed, stage `TODOS.md` for the version bump commit in Step 8.

---

## Step 6: Version Bump (auto-decide)

1. **Find the version source** (check in order, use the first match):
   - `VERSION` file
   - `package.json` → `"version"` field
   - `pyproject.toml` → `version` field
   - `Cargo.toml` → `version` field
   - **None found** → create a `VERSION` file starting at `0.1.0`

2. **Auto-decide the bump level based on the diff:**
   - Count lines changed: `git diff origin/<target>...HEAD --stat | tail -1`
   - **PATCH** (3rd digit): < 50 lines changed, bug fixes, trivial tweaks, config
   - **MINOR** (2nd digit): 50+ lines changed, new features, significant changes
   - **MAJOR** (1st digit): **ASK the user** — only for breaking changes or milestones

3. **Compute the new version:**
   - Bumping a digit resets all digits to its right to 0
   - Example: `1.2.3` + MINOR → `1.3.0`

4. **Write the new version** to the same source where it was found.

---

## Step 7: CHANGELOG (auto-generate)

1. **If `CHANGELOG.md` does not exist**, create it with a standard header:
   ```markdown
   # Changelog

   All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
   ```

2. **Auto-generate the entry** from ALL commits on the branch:
   - Use `git log <target>..HEAD --oneline` for commit history
   - Use `git diff <target>...HEAD` for the full diff
   - Categorize changes into applicable sections:
     - `### Added` — new features
     - `### Changed` — changes to existing functionality
     - `### Fixed` — bug fixes
     - `### Removed` — removed features
   - Only include sections that have entries
   - Write concise, descriptive bullet points
   - Insert after the file header, dated today
   - Format: `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`

3. **Do NOT ask the user to describe changes.** Infer from the diff and commit history.

---

## Step 8: Commit (bisectable chunks)

**Goal:** Create small, logical commits that work well with `git bisect`.

This step handles **uncommitted changes only** — do not rewrite, reorder, or amend
existing branch commits. The branch history is the developer's responsibility.

If there are no uncommitted changes, skip to Step 9.

1. **Commit ordering** (earlier commits first):
   - **Infrastructure:** migrations, config changes, route additions
   - **Models & services:** new models, services, concerns (with their tests)
   - **Controllers & views:** controllers, views, components (with their tests)
   - **VERSION + CHANGELOG:** always in the final commit

2. **Rules for splitting:**
   - A module/service and its test file go in the same commit
   - A controller, its views, and its test go in the same commit
   - Migrations are their own commit (or grouped with the model they support)
   - Config/route changes can group with the feature they enable
   - If the total diff is small (< 50 lines across < 4 files), a single commit is fine

3. **Each commit must be independently valid** — no broken imports, no references
   to code that doesn't exist yet. Order commits so dependencies come first.

4. **Commit message format:**
   - First line: `<type>: <summary>` (type = feat/fix/chore/refactor/docs)
   - Use the format defined in `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md` if available
   - Only the **final commit** gets the co-author trailer:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   chore: bump version and changelog (vX.Y.Z)

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

---

## Step 9: Push

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

Never force push.

---

## Step 10: Create PR

Target branch: `<target>` (from `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`).

```bash
git fetch origin
```

Verify the branch is still based on the latest `origin/<target>`.

Create a PR:

```bash
gh pr create --base <target> --title "<type>: <summary>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<bullet points from CHANGELOG>

## Validation
<commands run, pass/fail results>

## Test Coverage
<coverage diagram from Step 3.5, or "All new code paths have test coverage.">
<If Step 3.5 ran: "Tests: {before} → {after} (+{delta} new)">

## Pre-Landing Review
<findings from Step 5, or "No issues found.">

## Risks / Follow-ups
<assumptions, residual risk, follow-up work — or "None.">

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

```

**Output the PR URL** — this is the final output the user sees.

---

## Important Rules

- Never skip validation. If tests fail, stop.
- Never skip the pre-landing review.
- Never force push.
- Never merge without explicit user instruction.
- Never include unrelated dirty changes in a shipped diff.
- Never create a PR from a branch containing mixed-purpose work.
- Never proceed on stale branch state — always `git fetch` first.
- Never push without fresh verification evidence. If code changed after Step 3 tests, re-run before pushing.
- Stop when governance documents require stopping.
- If unsure, choose the minimum safe action and report the blocker.
- Respect each project's conventions — do not impose external conventions.
- Split commits for bisectability — each commit = one logical change.
- Step 3.5 generates coverage tests. They must pass before committing. Never commit failing tests.
- The goal is: user says `/ship`, next thing they see is the review + PR URL.

---

## Expected Outcome

When `/ship` completes successfully:

1. Branch verified as a single logical change
2. Synced with latest `origin/<target>`
3. All validation passed
4. Pre-landing review completed
5. Version bumped
6. CHANGELOG updated
7. Changes committed in bisectable chunks
8. Branch pushed
9. PR created targeting `<target>`
10. User sees the PR URL
