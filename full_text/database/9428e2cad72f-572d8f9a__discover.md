  Canonical Nexus discovery command. Writes repo-visible discovery artifacts and stage
  status through Nexus-owned normalization and governance. Use when the user says
  "I want to explore X", "we should look into Y", "I'm not sure what we should build for Z",
  or when the problem is still vague and needs clarification before /frame can scope it.

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not proactively suggest Nexus commands AND do not
auto-invoke skills based on conversation context. Only run skills the user explicitly
types (e.g., /qa, /ship). If you would have auto-invoked a skill, instead briefly say:
"I think /skillname might help here — want me to run it?" and wait for confirmation.
The user opted out of proactive behavior.

If `SKILL_PREFIX` is `"true"`, the user has namespaced Nexus commands. When suggesting
or invoking other Nexus commands, use the `/nexus-` prefix (e.g., `/nexus-qa` instead
of `/qa`, `/nexus-ship` instead of `/ship`). Disk paths are unaffected — always use
`~/.claude/skills/nexus/[skill-name]/SKILL.md` for reading skill files.

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.claude/skills/nexus/nexus-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the release-based "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined). `/nexus-upgrade` now upgrades from published Nexus releases on the configured release channel, not from upstream repo head. If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell user "Running Nexus v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present, always include the standardized runtime summary before moving on to work, even when `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `yes`.

When summarizing setup or upgrade state, always keep `REPO_MODE` and `EXECUTION_MODE` separate:
- `REPO_MODE` is repo ownership only, for example `solo` or `collaborative`
- `EXECUTION_MODE` is runtime routing only, either `governed_ccb` or `local_provider`
- Never describe `solo` or `collaborative` as an execution mode
- If `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no`, say it is the current default derived from machine state, not a saved preference
- `EXECUTION_MODE_SOURCE` explains whether the active route came from a saved preference or a machine-state default
- `EXECUTION_PATH` is the current effective route, for example `codex-via-ccb`
- `CURRENT_SESSION_READY` tells you whether the chosen route is runnable right now in this host/session
- `REQUIRED_GOVERNED_PROVIDERS` is the governed provider set Nexus needs for the standard dual-audit path
- when `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb`, also surface `GOVERNED_READY`, `MOUNTED_PROVIDERS`, and `MISSING_PROVIDERS`
- `LOCAL_PROVIDER_CANDIDATE`, `LOCAL_PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY`, `LOCAL_PROVIDER_EXECUTION_PATH`, and `LOCAL_PROVIDER_READY` describe the current-host local fallback path

Whenever you summarize setup, upgrade, or first-run state, present runtime status in this order:
- Repo mode: `REPO_MODE`
- Execution mode: `EXECUTION_MODE` plus whether it is a saved preference or a machine-state default (`EXECUTION_MODE_SOURCE`)
- Execution path: `EXECUTION_PATH`
- Current session ready: `CURRENT_SESSION_READY`
- If `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb`: governed ready, mounted providers, missing providers
- If `EXECUTION_MODE=local_provider` because governed CCB is not ready, explicitly say whether that is because CCB is missing or because mounted providers are incomplete, and include the local fallback path
- Branch: `_BRANCH`
- Proactive: `PROACTIVE`

When `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb` and `CURRENT_SESSION_READY` is `no`, explicitly tell the user whether the gap is:
- CCB not installed (`CCB_AVAILABLE=no`), or
- CCB installed but required providers are not mounted (`MISSING_PROVIDERS` is non-empty)

If `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb` and `CURRENT_SESSION_READY` is `no` and `LOCAL_PROVIDER_READY` is `yes`, use AskUserQuestion before moving into lifecycle work:

> Nexus is currently configured for governed CCB, but this session cannot run that route.
> The local provider path is ready, so you can either switch this host to local_provider or keep the governed CCB preference and mount the missing providers.
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose A if you want to work now in this host. Choose B only if you intend to mount CCB providers before continuing.
> A) Switch this host to local_provider (human: ~0m / CC: ~0m) — Completeness: 8/10
> B) Keep governed_ccb and mount the missing CCB providers (human: ~2m / CC: ~0m) — Completeness: 9/10

If A:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set execution_mode local_provider
if [ -n "$_LOCAL_PROVIDER_CANDIDATE" ]; then
  ~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set primary_provider "$_LOCAL_PROVIDER_CANDIDATE"
fi
if [ -n "$_LOCAL_PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY" ]; then
  ~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set provider_topology "$_LOCAL_PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY"
fi
```
Then explain that future Nexus runs on this host will use `local_provider` until the user changes the saved preference.

If B: do not change Nexus config. Tell the user to mount the missing providers before running governed commands. If CCB is installed but providers are missing, say the standard start path is `tmux` with `ccb codex gemini claude`. If CCB is not installed, say they need to install or restore CCB first.

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present and `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no`, state the effective execution mode explicitly using `EXECUTION_MODE`, `EXECUTION_MODE_SOURCE`, and `CCB_AVAILABLE`. Use `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config effective-execution` when you need the effective provider, topology, or requested execution path.
When `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb`, do not ask the user to configure `PRIMARY_PROVIDER` or `PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY`. Those are local-provider host preferences, not governed CCB config keys.

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present and `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no` and `GOVERNED_READY` is `yes`, use AskUserQuestion to persist the execution preference:

> Nexus just upgraded, but this machine still has no saved execution-mode preference.
> Repo mode only tells you whether the repo is solo or collaborative.
> Execution mode tells Nexus whether to stay in this Claude session or move to the governed CCB path.
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose B if you want the standard governed Nexus path, because CCB is already installed. Completeness: 9/10.
> A) Stay in the current Claude session with local_provider (human: ~0m / CC: ~0m) — Completeness: 8/10
> B) Persist governed_ccb and use mounted CCB providers (human: ~1m / CC: ~0m) — Completeness: 9/10

If A:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set execution_mode local_provider
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set primary_provider claude
```
Then explain that the current session can continue with `local_provider`, and if `PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY` is empty the default local topology is `single_agent`. Claude local-provider topologies invoke the local Claude CLI; inside Claude Code they are guarded unless `NEXUS_ALLOW_NESTED_CLAUDE=1` is set.

If B:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set execution_mode governed_ccb
```
Then explain that `governed_ccb` requires active CCB providers for this repo, and that the standard way to start them is `tmux` with `ccb codex gemini claude` if they are not already mounted.

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present and `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no` and `GOVERNED_READY` is `no`, tell the user Nexus is defaulting to `local_provider` for this host/session. If `CCB_AVAILABLE` is `no`, say that CCB is not detected. If `CCB_AVAILABLE` is `yes`, say which providers are mounted and which are still missing. In both cases, state the effective local provider/topology/path and tell them they can run `./setup` later if they want Nexus to help persist a different execution preference.

If `LAKE_INTRO` is `no`: Before continuing, introduce the Nexus Completeness Principle.
Tell the user: "Nexus follows the **Completeness Principle** — when the bounded, correct
implementation costs only a little more than the shortcut, prefer finishing the real job."

Then run:

```bash
touch ~/.nexus/.completeness-intro-seen
```

This only happens once.

If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `no` AND `LAKE_INTRO` is `yes`: After the lake intro is handled,
ask the user about proactive behavior. Use AskUserQuestion:

> Nexus can proactively figure out when you might need a skill while you work —
> like suggesting /qa when you say "does this work?" or /investigate when you hit
> a bug. We recommend keeping this on — it speeds up every part of your workflow.

Options:
- A) Keep it on (recommended)
- B) Turn it off — I'll type /commands myself

If A: run `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set proactive true`
If B: run `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set proactive false`

Always run:
```bash
touch ~/.nexus/.proactive-prompted
```

This only happens once. If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`, skip this entirely.

If `HAS_ROUTING` is `no` AND `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `false` AND `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`:
Check if a CLAUDE.md file exists in the project root. If it does not exist, create it.
Before prompting, treat either the standard `## Nexus Skill Routing` section or any
existing instruction that routes lifecycle work through `/discover` to `/closeout`
as equivalent Nexus routing guidance. If equivalent guidance already exists, skip this entirely.

Use AskUserQuestion:

> Nexus works best when your project's CLAUDE.md includes canonical Nexus command
> routing guidance. This helps Claude invoke `/discover` through `/closeout`
> consistently without turning CLAUDE.md into a second contract layer.

Options:
- A) Add Nexus invocation guidance to CLAUDE.md (recommended)
- B) No thanks, I'll invoke Nexus commands manually

If A: Append this section to the end of CLAUDE.md only when the file does not already
contain equivalent Nexus routing guidance:

```markdown

## Nexus Skill Routing

When the user's request matches a canonical Nexus command, invoke that command first.
This guidance helps command discovery only.
Contracts, transitions, governed artifacts, and lifecycle truth are owned by `lib/nexus/`
and canonical `.planning/` artifacts.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke discover
- Scope definition, requirements framing, non-goals → invoke frame
- Architecture review, execution readiness, implementation planning → invoke plan
- Governed routing and handoff packaging → invoke handoff
- Bounded implementation execution → invoke build
- Code review, check my diff → invoke review
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke qa
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke ship
- Final governed verification and closure → invoke closeout
```

Do not auto-commit the file. After updating `CLAUDE.md`, tell the user the routing
guidance was added and can be committed with their next repo change.

If B: run `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set routing_declined true`
Say "No problem. You can add routing guidance later by running `nexus-config set routing_declined false` and re-running any Nexus skill."

This only happens once per project. If `HAS_ROUTING` is `yes` or `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `true`, skip this entirely.

## Voice

**Tone:** direct, concrete, sharp, never corporate, never academic. Sound like a builder, not a consultant. Name the file, the function, the command. No filler, no throat-clearing.

**Writing rules:** No em dashes (use commas, periods, "..."). No AI vocabulary (delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, etc.). Short paragraphs. End with what to do.

The user always has context you don't. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision — the user decides.



## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. At the end of each major workflow step, rate your Nexus experience 0-10. If not a 10 and there's an actionable bug or improvement — file a field report.

**File only:** Nexus tooling bugs where the input was reasonable but Nexus failed. **Skip:** user app bugs, network errors, auth failures on user's site.

**To file:** write `~/.nexus/contributor-logs/{slug}.md`:
```
# {Title}
**What I tried:** {action} | **What happened:** {result} | **Rating:** {0-10}
## Repro
1. {step}
## What would make this a 10
{one sentence}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```
Slug: lowercase hyphens, max 60 chars. Skip if exists. Max 3/session. File inline, don't stop.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```

## Plan Mode Safe Operations

When in plan mode, these operations are always allowed because they produce
artifacts that inform the plan, not code changes:

- `$B` commands (browse: screenshots, page inspection, navigation, snapshots)
- `$D` commands (design: generate mockups, variants, comparison boards, iterate)
- `codex exec` / `codex review` only when the active provider route allows Codex
  or the user explicitly asks for Codex; in `local_provider` with a non-Codex
  primary, use the host/local subagent path instead
- Writing to `~/.nexus/` (config, review artifacts, design artifacts, learnings, eureka notes)
- Writing to the plan file (already allowed by plan mode)
- `open` commands for viewing generated artifacts (comparison boards, HTML previews)

These are read-only in spirit — they inspect the live site, generate visual artifacts,
or get independent opinions. They do NOT modify project source files.

## Plan Status Footer

When you are in plan mode and about to call ExitPlanMode:

1. Check if the plan file already has a `## NEXUS REVIEW REPORT` section.
2. If it DOES — skip (a review skill already wrote a richer report).
3. If it does NOT — run this command:

\`\`\`bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-review-read
\`\`\`

Then write a `## NEXUS REVIEW REPORT` section to the end of the plan file:

- If the output contains review entries (JSONL lines before `---CONFIG---`): format the
  standard report table with runs/status/findings per skill, same format as the review
  skills use.
- If the output is `NO_REVIEWS` or empty: write this placeholder table:

\`\`\`markdown
## NEXUS REVIEW REPORT

| Review | Trigger | Why | Runs | Status | Findings |
|--------|---------|-----|------|--------|----------|
| CEO Review | \`/plan-ceo-review\` | Scope & strategy | 0 | — | — |
| Codex Review | \`/codex review\` | Independent 2nd opinion | 0 | — | — |
| Eng Review | \`/plan-eng-review\` | Architecture & tests (required) | 0 | — | — |
| Design Review | \`/plan-design-review\` | UI/UX gaps | 0 | — | — |

**VERDICT:** NO REVIEWS YET — run \`/autoplan\` for full review pipeline, or individual reviews above.
\`\`\`

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This writes to the plan file, which is the one
file you are allowed to edit in plan mode. The plan file review report is part of the
plan's living status.

# /discover — Nexus Discovery

Nexus-owned discovery guidance for clarifying the problem before framing.

## Iron Laws (mandatory; non-negotiable)

These three rules apply to every `/discover` invocation regardless of provider, topology, or run mode. They are short and absolute on purpose — discipline that lives in qualifiers does not survive contact with the LLM at decision time. `/discover` is the entry edge of the lifecycle; ambiguity here propagates straight through to the user.

### Law 1 — What `/discover` Is NOT

`/discover` rejects these patterns at entry. If the work is drifting into any of them, stop and reframe:

1. **Not a feature spec** — discovery does not produce "build X with Y fields and Z button." That is `/plan`'s output. Discovery output is a problem statement; the solution comes after `/frame` confirms scope.
2. **Not user testing** — discovery is not "have users click on prototypes and tell us what they think." It is upstream of any artifact to test. If the work is testing something, it is not yet discovery.
3. **Not a substitute for shipping** — discovery does not replace learning from a shipped change. If a small slice can be shipped to validate the hypothesis, route to `pol-probe` (lightweight validation) instead of expanding discovery scope.
4. **Not single-stakeholder framing** — discovery from one person's view of the problem is biased framing. The artifact must reflect ≥2 perspectives (user + owner, owner + ops, etc.); single-source discovery is captured but flagged as a known limitation.
5. **Not solutioning in disguise** — "we should add X" is a solution. "Users currently fail at Y because Z" is discovery. If the brief reads like a feature list, discovery hasn't started yet.

A `/discover` artifact that reads like any of these is a category error. Re-enter discovery rather than passing the artifact to `/frame`.

### Law 2 — Minimum Signal Bar Before `/frame`

`docs/product/idea-brief.md` MUST carry the following before `/discover` writes `status.json` with verdict `ready`:

1. **Named user segment** — not "users." A specific segment with a name (e.g., "operators running multi-provider Nexus on macOS"). The name does not have to be a customer; it has to be specific enough that ≠ "everyone."
2. **Observed pain with cost** — what the named user fails at and what that failure costs (time, money, churn, broken trust). "Users are frustrated" fails; "operators run /build, hit a 3-strike loop, and abandon the session 18% of the time per session-archive logs" passes.
3. **≥2 evidence sources** — at least two distinct sources informed this discovery. Sources count as: user interviews, support tickets, metrics, prior PRDs, market signals, internal usage logs, customer email threads. Two sources of the same type (e.g., two interview transcripts) count as two; same source quoted twice does not.
4. **Hypothesis hint** — a one-paragraph version of the "If/Then/Because" hypothesis (per `/frame` Law 2) that `/frame` will sharpen. The hint may be incomplete; the framing pass refines it. But discovery without a hypothesis hint is observation, not direction.
5. **Open questions list** — explicit questions for `/frame` to answer, ≥3 items. "What's the success metric?", "Which segment ships first?", "What's the rollback plan?" are typical. Empty open-questions sections mean discovery overclaimed.

If any of the five fail, `/discover` returns `not_ready`. `/frame` reads the verdict from the advisor record. If `not_ready`, `/frame` cannot proceed.

Discovery-from-vibes is a real failure mode. The signal bar exists because two interviews + one customer email is cheaper than three weeks of `/build` based on guessed framing.

### Law 3 — Look Inward Before Look Outward

`idea-brief.md` MUST contain two clearly separated sections, in this order:

1. **Look Inward** — what the team currently believes, before gathering evidence. Captures team assumptions, prior framings, the hypothesis the team is bringing in. This section is written FIRST so the team's prior is on the record.
2. **Look Outward** — what evidence was gathered (interviews, tickets, metrics, etc.) and what it actually said. Cite each piece of evidence to its source per Law 2.

Without **Look Inward**, the team cannot tell what its prior was — and cannot tell whether its evidence collection was confirming or challenging that prior. That is the trap of confirmation-only discovery: the team interviews until interviews agree with what the team already thought.

The brief MAY end with a brief **Reframe** section noting where Look Outward changed Look Inward — what the team thought going in vs. what it concluded. The Reframe is the receipt that discovery happened.

The reason: a discovery brief that does not record the team's prior is unfalsifiable as a discovery output. There is no way to tell whether the brief reflects what users said or what the team wanted users to say.

## How to run /discover

These steps execute one `/discover` run. Iron Laws constrain *what must be true at decision time*; this workflow defines *what to do in what order*. Both apply.

### Step 1 — Read upstream context

If a prior closeout produced `next-run-bootstrap.json` or `RETRO-CONTINUITY.md` for this run, read them first. They carry seeded discovery context and prior open questions; ignoring them duplicates work the team already did.

If no prior closeout context exists, this is a fresh discovery run — proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2 — Capture Look Inward

Before gathering any evidence, write the team's current beliefs into a draft `idea-brief.md` `## Look Inward` section (per Law 3). Capture:

- The problem the team thinks exists
- The user segment the team thinks is affected
- The hypothesis the team is bringing in
- Any prior framings or assumptions the team is operating under

This step exists so confirmation bias is on the record. Skip it and Law 3 fails.

### Step 3 — Detect anti-patterns early

If the captured Look Inward already reads like any of Law 1's 5 anti-patterns (feature spec, user testing, substitute-for-shipping, single-stakeholder, solutioning in disguise), STOP. Use `AskUserQuestion`:

> "The current Look Inward reads like a [feature spec | solutioning | etc.]. Should I (a) reframe as a problem statement, (b) route to `pol-probe` for lightweight validation, or (c) continue and flag in the brief?"

The operator picks; record the choice in the brief.

### Step 4 — Gather Look Outward evidence

Per Law 2 the brief needs ≥2 distinct evidence sources. Sources to consider:

- User interviews (transcripts or notes)
- Support tickets matching the problem space
- Usage metrics or telemetry
- Prior PRDs or design docs
- Market signals (competitor moves, public commentary)
- Customer email threads
- Internal usage observations

Cite each piece of evidence to its source. Two interview transcripts count as two sources; the same email quoted twice does not.

### Step 5 — Synthesize hypothesis hint

From Look Outward findings, draft a one-paragraph "If/Then/Because" hint per Law 2 #4. This is not the final hypothesis — `/frame` Law 2 sharpens it. The hint just commits to a direction the framing pass can refine.

### Step 6 — Enumerate open questions

List ≥3 explicit questions for `/frame` to answer (per Law 2 #5). Examples:

- "What's the falsifiable success metric?"
- "Which user segment ships first?"
- "What's the rollback plan if hypothesis fails?"

If you can't enumerate three, the discovery has overclaimed — return to Step 4 and gather more.

### Step 7 — Write Reframe section (optional but recommended)

If Look Outward changed Look Inward in any way, write a brief `## Reframe` section noting:

- What the team thought going in
- What it concluded after evidence
- Why the change matters

The Reframe is the receipt that discovery actually happened.

### Step 8 — Verify all 5 Law 2 checks pass

Before writing `status.json`, verify the brief has:

1. Named user segment (not "users")
2. Observed pain with concrete cost
3. ≥2 distinct evidence sources cited
4. Hypothesis hint
5. ≥3 open questions

If any fail, return to the relevant step. If all pass, proceed to Step 9.

### Step 9 — Write status

Run the canonical command (in the Routing section below). It writes `idea-brief.md`, `status.json`, and any continuation artifacts. The advisor record carries the verdict; `/frame` reads it.

## Operator Checklist

- capture goals
- capture constraints
- record open questions

## Artifact Contract

Writes `docs/product/idea-brief.md`, `.planning/current/discover/status.json`, and, for fresh runs seeded from archived closeout, `.planning/current/discover/NEXT-RUN.md`, `.planning/current/discover/next-run-bootstrap.json`, `.planning/current/discover/retro-continuity.json`, `.planning/current/discover/RETRO-CONTINUITY.md`, `.planning/current/discover/session-continuation-advice.json`, and `.planning/current/discover/SESSION-CONTINUATION.md`.

## Routing

Advance to `/frame` only after Nexus writes the discovery artifacts.

Run:

```bash
_REPO_CWD="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
_NEXUS_ROOT="~/.claude/skills/nexus"
[ -d "$_REPO_CWD/.claude/skills/nexus" ] && _NEXUS_ROOT="$_REPO_CWD/.claude/skills/nexus"
cd "$_NEXUS_ROOT" && NEXUS_PROJECT_CWD="$_REPO_CWD" ./bin/nexus discover
```

## Typical prompts

These are example user requests `/discover` handles well. The skill is invoked and produces a structured `idea-brief.md` plus `status.json`.

### Prompt 1 — Vague feature idea

> "I think Nexus should have some kind of telemetry, but I don't really know what shape."

`/discover` walks Step 1–9. Look Inward captures the team's prior ("telemetry would help with X"). Look Outward gathers evidence (existing logs? competitor approaches? user requests?). Hypothesis hint emerges. Open questions enumerate what `/frame` must decide. Brief returns `ready` if all 5 Law 2 checks pass.

### Prompt 2 — Reactive problem framing

> "Multiple users are reporting `/build` feels broken when 3-strike fires; I want to understand why before we patch."

Step 1 reads any prior `LEARNINGS.md` for relevant context. Step 2 captures team's current theory. Step 3 detects whether the prompt is already a solution (it isn't — "understand why" is discovery-shaped). Step 4 gathers actual session logs, prior reports. Step 5 produces hypothesis hint. The brief frames the problem rather than proposing fixes.

### Prompt 3 — Strategic exploration

> "Should Nexus expand beyond CCB transport? What would that look like?"

Step 2 captures team's strategic prior. Step 4 gathers competitive landscape, current architectural constraints, prior strategic docs. Hypothesis hint commits to one direction (e.g., "If we add X transport, then Y users will Z because evidence W"). Open questions are aggressive — multiple items the team can't yet answer.

These prompts test that `/discover` produces structured discovery output, not feature specs or implementation plans (Iron Law 1's anti-patterns).

## Completion Advisor

After `/discover` returns, prefer the runtime JSON field `completion_advisor`. If the host only has
filesystem access, or the field is absent, fall back to `.planning/current/discover/completion-advisor.json`.
If the runtime exited nonzero, inspect `completion_context.completion_advisor` from the error JSON
envelope before falling back to disk. Treat that advisor as the canonical next-step contract.

Read and summarize:

- `summary`
- `interaction_mode`
- `requires_user_choice`
- `primary_next_actions`
- `alternative_next_actions`
- `recommended_side_skills`
- `stop_action`
- `project_setup_gaps`
- `suppressed_surfaces`
- `default_action_id`

If `interaction_mode` is `summary_only`, do not call AskUserQuestion. Print the advisor
`summary`, any `project_setup_gaps`, and the invocation for the `default_action_id` if one exists.

If the session is interactive and `interaction_mode` is not `summary_only`, always use
AskUserQuestion for `/discover` completion.

If the host cannot display AskUserQuestion, rerun `/discover` with `--output interactive`
to print the same runtime-owned chooser in the terminal. Do not reconstruct choices
from `status.json`.

If `interaction_mode` is `recommended_choice`, present:

1. recommended primary action
2. other primary actions
3. alternatives
4. recommended side skills
5. `stop_action`

If `interaction_mode` is `required_choice`, present only the actions emitted by the advisor.

Use each action's `label` and `description`. If an action has `visibility_reason`,
`why_this_skill`, or `evidence_signal`, include it in the explanation so the user sees
why it is showing up now.

After the user chooses an action, run the selected `invocation` unless the selected action
is `stop_action` or has no invocation.

`/discover` normally has a single canonical continuation into `/frame`. The advisor may also surface
`/pol-probe` as a side skill when Iron Law 1's anti-patterns suggest lightweight validation is the
right next move (e.g., the discovery output is starting to read like solutioning rather than problem
framing). For genuinely strategic discoveries that need additional sharpening, the advisor may
recommend re-entering `/discover` with a tighter hypothesis hint before `/frame`.

If the session is non-interactive, print the advisor `summary` and the invocation for the
`default_action_id` when one exists.
