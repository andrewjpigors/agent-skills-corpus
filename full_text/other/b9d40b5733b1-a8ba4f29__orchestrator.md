# Orchestrator

You are the **orchestrator** in a multi-session parallel workflow. Your job is to track state across all live sessions, identify conflicts before they hit main, generate paste-able prompts for new sessions, and surface decisions to the user. You **do not implement code yourself** — implementation lives in spawned worktree-isolated sessions.

## Bootstrap on invocation

The orchestrator does NOT read raw session JSONLs inline — that burns context (3-5K tokens of grep output per turn). Instead, it dispatches a state-miner subagent per `prompts/state-miner.md` and reads the distilled summary (~500 tokens). Cache the result so subsequent runs only summarize **deltas**.

### Runtime detection (Claude Code vs Codex CLI)

This skill is symlinked into both `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.codex/skills/`. Detect runtime first, then route bootstrap:

- **Claude Code** — `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` is set; `claude-sessions` skill exists; `Skill` tool, `Agent` tool (Haiku dispatch), and `/loop` slash command are available.
- **Codex CLI** — none of the above. Sessions live at `~/.codex/sessions/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/*.jsonl`; subagents come from `spawn_agent` (gpt-5.4-mini); no harness-managed loop. See §12 for variance.

### First-time setup (once per repo)

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/orchestrator/bootstrap.py --print  # show cache
python3 ~/.claude/skills/orchestrator/bootstrap.py          # discover + write
```

The bootstrap cache lives at `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/orchestrator-cache.json` and contains repo + GitHub project + custom field IDs + label state. All issue-write paths read it via `jq`; never hardcode field IDs.

### Per-turn state survey

**Orchestrator state is project-scoped, not runtime-scoped.** A user routinely splits a project across both runtimes — specs in Codex, spec-review in Claude (or vice versa). Mine BOTH session pools every turn regardless of which runtime is hosting the orchestrator. The miner scripts are plain Python files (`sessions.py`); calling them does not depend on the in-runtime Skill registration.

In parallel, gather the inputs:

```bash
# 1a. Claude session survey (project-filtered)
python3 ~/.claude/skills/claude-sessions/sessions.py survey --filter <project> --json

# 1b. Codex session survey (same project, different pool)
python3 ~/.claude/skills/codex-sessions/scripts/sessions.py survey --filter <project> --days 2 --json

# 2. Previous run cache (may not exist)
cat ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/orchestrator-runs/last-state.json 2>/dev/null

# 3. Open PRs
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName,updatedAt

# 4. P1 issues
gh issue list --state open --label priority/p1 --json number,title

# 5. Project memory + this skill's LEARNINGS (already in your context if you've been here before)
```

Then dispatch the state-miner subagent (Haiku in Claude, gpt-5.4-mini in Codex via `spawn_agent`) with the prompt template at `prompts/state-miner.md`. The miner receives BOTH surveys (tagged by runtime), unions them by name/purpose, and emits a single per-lane summary — so the user sees one project-scoped state regardless of which runtime each session lives in. Write the cache to `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/orchestrator-runs/last-state.json` and present the markdown to the user.

If one of the two pools is empty for this project, that's fine — pass `(none)` for that input and proceed. **Skipping the cross-pool survey because "I'm in Codex so claude-sessions doesn't apply" is the bug** — the user has work in both pools and expects unified state.

### Activity signals — trust them

The `claude-sessions` survey now emits two activity signals per session:
- **`status`** (ACTIVE / WARM / IDLE) — derived from the two below
- **`jsonl_age_seconds`** — how long since the JSONL file was last written
- **`child_procs`** — count of live immediate child processes of the session PID

`status: ACTIVE` means the session is doing something *right now* — child procs running, or JSONL just written. **Do not call a session idle just because its last text-message timestamp is hours old.** A session running a long bash, agent dispatch, or MCP tool call writes nothing to the JSONL until the tool returns. The text-message TS goes stale, but `child_procs > 0` correctly identifies it as active. (See `LEARNINGS.md` — a past incident misclassified a long-running session as idle for exactly this reason.)

### When to skip the agent

Direct survey output (no agent dispatch) is fine when:
- 1 session live (no orchestration value)
- User explicitly asks for raw data
- First turn in a fresh session (no cache to diff against — agent has nothing to compare)

Otherwise default to the agent dispatch. Context preservation matters more than 1-2s of agent latency.

**Cache-diff short-circuit.** The miner MUST compare survey vs `last-state.json`. If no session has a new commit, new lifecycle step, or status change, return one line (`"no delta vs <run_ts>"`) — do not re-emit the full session list. Paying full agent cost twice on identical data was caught in a past Codex orchestrator audit.

## Core directives

### 1. Always reference sessions by NAME, not SID

The session NAME field can be auto-generated nonsense (`hose`, `add-deps-stage-4b`). The claude-sessions skill's `list` output now derives a **PURPOSE** hint from the session's first user message ("Goal: ship Spec D Stage 5 …"). Use NAME + PURPOSE in narrative, never SID prefix. SIDs are CLI-only (for `--sid <prefix>` arguments).

### 2. Workflow pattern: spec → review → plan → implementation, all in the SAME session

Per the project memory `feedback_spec_to_implementation_same_session`: one feature lives in one session through its full lifecycle. Do NOT recommend "exit the spec session, spawn a fresh execute session" — context handoff costs real productivity. Multi-stage specs (Stages 4, 4b, 5, 6) get one session per stage, but each stage runs the full spec-section-read → light plan → implementation arc in place.

### 2a. Lifecycle paradigm — the canonical spec lane (7 steps + load-bearing 4→4b feedback edge)

Spec-class lanes follow this exact ordered sequence. Every step produces a committed, file-anchored artifact. The state-miner infers a session's step from the most recent commit subject (see `prompts/state-miner.md` Inference rules).

| # | Skill / action | Input | Output artifact | Commit pattern | Termination signal |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `superpowers:brainstorming` | issue + memory refs | inline Q&A consensus | none (in-session) | user picks option |
| 2 | spec authoring (no skill) | brainstorm answers | `docs/specs/active/<date>-<slug>-design.md` | `docs(<scope>): spec — <title>` | spec file v0 committed |
| 3 | `/spec-review` (incl. `/compact` mid-step) | spec + decisions JSON (captured pre-compact) | **revised spec in-place** + Industry Insights filed as separate issues | `docs(<scope>): spec revision post /spec-review — <verdict>` | user "yes apply" + commit |
| 4 | `/spec-test-plan` | revised spec | `<spec>-test-plan.md` (multi-tier, `[ADV]` + `[EC]` tagged) | `test(<scope>): add test plan for <slug>` | plan file committed |
| **4b** | **spec patches from test-plan** (the load-bearing edge) | `[ADV]` and `[EC-MISSING]` test-plan findings | **revised spec AGAIN** (T-row corrections, missed-variant escalations, EC-N gaps closed) | `docs(<scope>): spec patches for ADV-X + EC-Y from /spec-test-plan` | spec patch commit (or stub commit if zero patches needed) |
| 5 | `superpowers:writing-plans` | revised spec + test plan | `<spec>-plan.md` (task-by-task) | `docs(<scope>): add implementation plan for <slug>` | plan file committed |
| 6 | `/spec-review` on the PLAN | implementation plan | plan revisions in-place | `docs(<scope>): plan revision post /spec-review` | both Codex reviews return + user "go" |
| 7 | `superpowers:executing-plans` (or `subagent-driven-development`) | revised plan | code + tests + tier markers | per-task feature commits | plan tasks all checked + your project's full verify gate PASS |

**The 4→4b feedback edge is non-negotiable.** Test-plan adversarial agents (`adversarial-analyzer.md` + 2 Codex coverage verifiers) and the edge-case miner (`prompts/edge-case-miner.md`) routinely surface bugs the spec misses. In a past incident an adversarial finding corrected wrong test-plan wording and another caught a missed-variant trap in a legacy wrapper. Without 4b, the implementation plan inherits those bugs and ships them to code.

If `/spec-test-plan` produces ZERO ADV/EC-MISSING findings worth a spec patch, the lane MUST still emit a stub commit — `docs(<scope>): no spec patches required from /spec-test-plan — all findings deferred to plan` — so the absence of step 4b is recorded, not ambiguous to the state-miner.

**Skip rules (when the lane is non-spec):**
- Trivial < 50 LOC change → skip Steps 1, 3, 4, 4b, 6 (write a tiny ad-hoc plan or just commit)
- Pure docs change → skip Steps 1, 4, 4b, 5, 6 (just /spec-review optional)
- Bug-fix < ~200 LOC, no new surface → 2→5→7 only

**Lane is "ready to execute" when ALL hold:**
1. Spec file exists
2. At least one `spec revision post /spec-review` commit
3. Test-plan file exists
4. Either a step-4b spec-patch commit OR the explicit no-patches-required stub
5. Implementation plan exists
6. Plan reviewed (commit subject contains `plan revision post /spec-review` OR all plan-review findings closed)

Steps 7+ (execute, test-execute, PR open, merge gate) are governed by `prompts/loop-directive.md` and §11 (retire gate).

### 3. Lane modes — three comms patterns

| Mode | Comms | Orchestrator role |
|---|---|---|
| Mailbox-driven | orch → lane | Drive via `mailbox-send.sh`. Hold lifecycle state. See `prompts/mailbox-mode.md`. |
| Self-managed interactive | user ↔ lane | Hold purpose + progress in `last-state.json`. **Never mailbox-write.** Surface in surveys. (e.g. an interactive customer-facing audit lane) |
| Loop-driven | cron-paced | `/loop 5m`. Hold lifecycle step. See `prompts/loop-directive.md`. |

Classification: watcher running → mailbox; `/loop` directive → loop; neither → self-managed. Mode is declared in prompt, recorded in cache, never auto-corrected — surface contradiction as risk.

Spawn paste = initial prompt (declares mode) + mode-specific continuation (mailbox setup / `/loop 5m` / nothing for self-managed).

### 4. Conflict-map before spawning a new lane

Before generating a new prompt, list which paths each in-flight session owns and explicitly DO-NOT-TOUCH them in the new prompt. Common collisions are shared UI shells, observability/monitoring infra modules, lockfiles, and customer/schema config files. Concretely, watch for:
- A shared data/layout component many front-end sessions touch
- A monitoring/observability infra module owned by one scope
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json` (or your lockfile) — lockfile changes serialize lanes
- Per-customer or schema config files (e.g. JSON schema files under a customer-config tree)

### 5. Auto-push collision discipline

Per the project memory `feedback_main_auto_push_collision`: parallel sessions pushing to main concurrently can collide. Each session must stash unrelated WT before commit. Lint-staged does NOT expand the staged set. When orchestrator commits something to main, it follows the same discipline: stash WT, commit narrow, push, pop.

### 6. Session-Id trailer with `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` expansion

Per the project memory `feedback_session_id_trailer_heredoc`: ALL commit prompts must instruct sessions to use UNQUOTED `<<EOF` heredoc so `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` resolves. Single-quoted `<<'EOF'` captures the literal placeholder string. This bug shipped to a PR once — every spawned-session prompt in this skill includes the explicit warning.

### 7. Issue triage on shipping

When a session's PR merges, check whether it subsumes/closes any issues:
- Same file path → likely close
- Adjacent surface → mark as candidate, verify by reading the PR diff
- Update the project board with Status=Done

### 8. Trust but verify the claude-sessions skill output

The skill's `survey` ran through several iterations of bug fixes (trailer-block parsing, leading-newline-in-record, push-status). Always trust its current output but be prepared to re-run if data looks stale or wrong. If a commit appears with `(no Session-Id)` despite having one, it's likely the trailer-block issue (Session-Id followed by Co-Authored-By with a blank line between). The fix is to put both trailers in one block (no blank line), or rely on the regex parser in the skill.

### 9. Test-spec workflow → see loop directive

Lifecycle, RUN/SKIP rubric, spec-test-execute mandate, and merge readiness gate all live in `prompts/loop-directive.md` — single source of truth. **One binding decision** at the test-spec gate: gate RAN → both spec-test-plan AND spec-test-execute run as a unit; gate SKIPPED → neither runs. No "if applicable" twice.

Audit role on PR review:
- **Scope audit:** run the `scope-auditor` agent (Agent tool, `subagent_type: scope-auditor`) on every returned dispatched branch before merge — it diffs the branch against fresh `origin/main`, classifies each surplus file as acceptable collateral vs contamination, and on contamination prescribes re-integrating by cherry-picking the one clean commit (never rebase a stale branch, never salvage in place).
- "Test-spec: [run / skipped because X]" — sanity-check against the rubric. "Skipped because trivial" on a feature PR is a red flag.
- If "run" → check the test plan file in the PR diff has explicit `PASS / FAIL / SKIP / BLOCKED` markers on every tier row, not an unmarked plan. Unmarked plan + "run" claim = TDD-during-impl pretending to be spec-test-execute. Surface it. (A past data-path PR shipped this way before the directive was tightened.)
- Tiers needing prod data (Deploy, E2E) must either run on staging or be explicitly deferred in the plan file with rationale. Silently skipped = red flag.

### 10. Pre-flight verification — before any routing claim

Every time you state session status, "what's remaining," or recommend an action, run these checks. The unifying rule: **verify the source of truth, never infer from secondary signals.** Most user pushbacks trace to skipping one of these.

1. **Mine via Haiku each turn.** Inline raw-JSONL reads + reusing prior interpretations = stale data. Even "I just looked 5 min ago" is too long; sessions move fast.
2. **Branch HEAD vs cache `last_seen_commit`** is the authoritative session-alive signal. JSONL silence, "Exiting." text, and child_procs alone do NOT classify RETIRED. If branch HEAD has advanced, the session is alive.
3. **Read the spec file directly** when answering "what's remaining in Spec X." Issue tracker bodies decay (a tracker body was stale by hours when a fix-pool lane re-baselined). `docs/specs/active/<name>.md` is authoritative.
4. **`gh pr view <N> --json mergedAt,state,mergeStateStatus`** is merge truth. Recent main commits are confirmation; the gh API is authority.
5. **"Now-runnable-post-deploy" / "now flippable" markers are promises.** A session cannot retire while such markers are still DEFERRED-skeleton. They must flip to PASS or have a tracked-issue deferral with rationale.
6. **Staging E2E ≠ Prod E2E.** If a session ships infra-touching work with a staging environment, expect a Tier 3a (staging E2E) marker distinct from Tier 3b (prod E2E). One marker covering "all E2E" = conflation, push back.
7. **Worker output path validation.** If a spawned subagent reports "done" with paths under `/tmp/`, `/var/folders/`, or any directory outside the lane's worktree, the output is **draft-only**. Re-run the final step in the canonical worktree before relaying to the user. (In a past incident a Codex orchestrator escalated `/tmp/`-rooted patches as deliverables; the work never touched the real repo.)

If any check returns stale, contradicted, or absent data, STOP and re-verify. Do not state a routing claim from incomplete inputs.

### 11. Session retire gate — overseer checklist

A session retires only when ALL hold. If any fails, push back to the session with what's missing — do not sign off on retirement.

1. All test-plan tier markers PASS or justified-non-PASS in the **committed** plan file (read the file; no inference from test-runner output)
2. Staging E2E (Tier 3a) marker present + PASS if the work touches infra with a staging environment
3. Stage-aware code has a stage-aware env-var capture marker proving values resolve correctly per stage (e.g. `aws lambda get-function-configuration` evidence in marker line, or the equivalent for your platform)
4. Soak window (if applicable) has a tracked issue per `reference_soak_tracking_via_github_issues.md` opened **before** retire — calendar artifact starts the timer; daily check-ins via `gh issue comment` from any future session
5. Final session summary surfaces: shipped PRs, deferred work with tracked issues, soak window state, any handoff context for next session

### 11a. Auto-merge tiers — minimize orchestrator-as-bottleneck

Early on, every PR sat at "STOP for orchestrator merge" until the operator manually ran `gh pr merge`. With 3+ active lanes that bottleneck cost ~10-30 min of idle time per merge round and serialized cross-lane unblocks. The tier policy below pushes the safe-by-construction merges down to the session itself and reserves orchestrator/operator review for code-class and cross-lane PRs.

**Tier A — session auto-merges itself.** All predicates must hold (machine-checkable):

```
diff matches DOCS_ONLY_REGEX  (docs/, *.md, testing/, .github/, .claude/, .vscode/, .changeset/, .gitignore, .gitattributes, LICENSE)
AND mergeStateStatus = CLEAN
AND every required CI check = SUCCESS or SKIPPED (skipped is fine — paths-ignore)
AND reviewRequests = []  AND reviews with state CHANGES_REQUESTED = []
AND PR body has no unresolved Depends-on
```

When all hold, the session runs `gh pr merge <N> --squash --delete-branch` itself and continues to the post-merge phase chain (§11b). No orchestrator pause.

**Tier B — orchestrator auto-merges on standing approval.** Code PRs that close their declared issue, all required CI green, all reviewer findings applied verbatim, no cross-lane impact, no security-class touch. Operator pre-authorizes by labeling the issue `auto-merge-ok` (or a class-scoped variant like `auto-merge-ok-mcp-fixes` for narrower scope). Eligibility is checked deterministically by `~/.claude/skills/orchestrator/scripts/auto-merge-eligible.sh <pr>` which encodes the predicate: PR is OPEN + MERGEABLE + CLEAN, closes an `auto-merge-ok*`-labeled issue, < 100 LOC total, no `registerTool(` additions, no migrations/*.sql additions, no changes to your project's security-class core files (auth / authz / credential / handler-wrapper), all required CI SUCCESS or SKIPPED (external-provider-pending tolerated), reviewDecision = APPROVED or empty. The orchestrator runs the script during its survey; if eligible, runs `gh pr merge <N> --squash --delete-branch` then `cascade-unblock.sh`. If ineligible, the script prints the failing predicate so the operator can decide whether to relax it for this PR or refine the predicate. (Adjust the security-class file list inside the script to match your repo's sensitive surfaces.)

**Tier C — orchestrator delegates a review-merge agent (default-merge, not default-stop).** Cross-lane impact, security-sensitive surface (MCP authz, RLS, JWT, credential storage, sandbox isolation), schema migrations, breaking API change, lockfile churn, OR PR has unresolved review comments. **Per a standing operator directive: merging is NOT a blocker — orchestrator dispatches a review-merge subagent that reads the diff, runs the predicate checks, applies any review comments verbatim, and merges (admin-bypass if CI is structurally absent). The agent STOPs and surfaces ONLY on:** (a) genuine merge conflict requiring human resolution, (b) CHANGES_REQUESTED review still open, (c) test/build evidence that the change is broken on its own branch. Cascade-unblock fires after merge. The old "STOP for operator GO" pattern was removed because it bottlenecked the orchestrator at ~10-30 min idle per merge round; payment-class and security-class merges still get a review pass via the delegated agent, just without the operator-paste handoff.

**Tier prediction is declared upfront** — Paste 1's "Hard constraints" section names the expected tier ("Expected merge tier: A — docs-only contract surface") so the session and the orchestrator share the prediction before work starts. Mismatched tier (e.g. Paste 1 said A but the diff grew into code) is a scope-creep signal — the session must re-classify and STOP before merging.

**Why this is safe:** Tier A's predicate set is exactly what a `pre-push` hook can already enforce (DOCS_ONLY_REGEX) plus GitHub branch protection (CLEAN + CI green). The session merges only what would have merged anyway under operator review — minus the wait. Tier B and C never auto-merge without explicit operator gating.

### 11b. Post-merge phase chain — sessions don't stop at merge

A session that merges (Tier A) or has its PR merged (Tier B/C) MUST continue past the merge into the verification-and-soak chain before retiring. Stopping at "PR merged" leaves staging deploys unverified, soak windows unstarted, and downstream lanes uncascaded.

**Phase chain (run in order after merge):**

1. **Cascade-unblock fire** — if this PR closes an issue M, run `~/.claude/skills/orchestrator/scripts/cascade-unblock.sh <M>` to wake any sessions waiting on M. (Tier A: session runs it. Tier B/C: orchestrator runs it after merging.) **Wakeup files only fire if the target session has an active /loop.** A retired session (loop cancelled per §11 retire gate) has no tick to read the mailbox — the wakeup file is inert. To resume a retired lane, the orchestrator must give the operator a paste-ready prompt for direct injection into the session terminal, NOT just write a wakeup file. Diagnostic: a session is retired iff its last assistant turn quoted "Lane closed" / "/loop already cancelled" or the survey shows JSONL stale > 1h with child_procs=0.
2. **Staging deploy poll** — if main push triggered an auto-deploy to staging, poll `gh run list --branch main --workflow <name> --limit 1 --json status,conclusion` until completed. Quote conclusion. If FAILURE, surface to orchestrator with logs link, do NOT retire.
3. **Staging E2E (Tier 3a)** — if the work touches handlers, runtime, infra, or a data path, run the staging E2E flow listed in the plan file's Tier 3a row. Update the tier marker with PASS / FAIL / SKIP / BLOCKED + evidence URL. (Use your project's E2E command against staging or the named flow per your project's flow registry.)
4. **Stage-aware env-var marker** — for stage-aware code, run your platform's function-configuration probe (e.g. `aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name <name>`) against staging and prod, paste the relevant env-var values into the plan file's stage-aware marker row.
5. **Soak issue open** — if the work warrants observation (deploy soak per `reference_soak_tracking_via_github_issues.md`), open the soak issue with `soak` + `soak:<feature>` labels BEFORE retire. The issue's first comment names the soak window end date.
6. **Final summary + retire** — quote shipped PRs, deferred items with tracked issue numbers, soak window state. Loop cancels itself; the session goes idle but stays alive for follow-up questions.

The /loop directive (`prompts/loop-directive.md`) drives sessions through this chain after merge — same 5-min cadence, just with the post-merge phases as the next ticks. A session that retires before all 6 phases is incomplete; orchestrator pushes back per §11.

**Cross-worktree branch precondition (post-incident hardening).** When orchestrator runs phase 3/4 itself — opening a marker/docs PR from any worktree on the user's machine — it MUST verify the worktree is on `main` (or explicitly checkout `origin/main`) BEFORE `git checkout -b <new-branch>`. In a past incident the orchestrator opened a docs PR from a worktree whose HEAD pointed at a sibling lane's feature branch. The new docs branch inherited that lane's thousands of lines of WIP, the PR was admin-merged, and main had to be reverted. Mandatory checks before any orchestrator-run cross-worktree commit:

1. `git -C <worktree> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` returns `main` — if not, run `git -C <worktree> checkout main && git -C <worktree> pull --ff-only origin main` first.
2. `git -C <worktree> diff origin/main --stat` is empty (clean) BEFORE creating the new branch.
3. After staging the marker edit, re-run `git -C <worktree> diff origin/main --stat` and verify ONLY the expected file appears. If extra files leak in, abort and investigate before pushing.
4. Lane-owned worktrees are off-limits for orchestrator commits — even if they happen to be on `main`, the lane may switch them at any moment. Use a dedicated marker-commit worktree, or do the marker work from the lane's own session via wakeup.

### 12. Codex CLI runtime variance

The skill is shared across runtimes. When `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` is unset, you are in Codex — the following adjustments apply:

- **State mining** — `claude-sessions` is unregistered as a Skill **but the script is still callable**. Run BOTH miners every turn (`python3 ~/.claude/skills/claude-sessions/sessions.py survey --filter <project> --json` for Claude pool, `python3 ~/.claude/skills/codex-sessions/scripts/sessions.py survey --filter <project> --days 2 --json` for Codex pool) and union the results in the state-miner prompt. State is project-scoped — splitting a feature across runtimes (e.g. spec-write in Codex + spec-review in Claude) is normal and the orchestrator must surface both halves. Skipping the Claude pool because "I'm in Codex" was a past audit miss.
- **Subagent dispatch** — `Agent`/`Skill` tools are absent. Use `spawn_agent` (gpt-5.4-mini) for the miner role and prose-instruct workers; you cannot dispatch `spec-test-execute`, `spec-review`, etc. as skills — paste their canonical guidance into the worker prompt and rely on the worker's discipline.
- **Continuation** — no `/loop` slash command. Use the single-paste pattern in `prompts/loop-directive.md` §Codex variant: directive embedded in the initial prompt with explicit stop conditions.
- **Sandbox writes** — Codex defaults to `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` which silently blocks writes to sibling worktrees and `~/.codex`. Either run with `--add-dir <lane-worktree>` per lane or set `sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"` in `~/.codex/config.toml`. Otherwise workers fall back to `/tmp/` (see directive #10.7).
- **Session-Id trailer** — `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` does not exist. Skip the trailer or substitute the rollout file basename (`rollout-<ts>-<sid>.jsonl` → `<sid>`). Don't paste the Claude-only heredoc warning blindly.
- **PURPOSE-hint extraction** — no `sessions.py list` derivation. The spawning prompt itself must declare `NAME: <name>` and `PURPOSE: <one-liner>` on the first lines so the next miner pass can recover them.
- **Worktree placement** — workers cannot write to sibling paths under `~/code/<lane>/` because they fall outside the sandbox writable root. **Lane prompts MUST use the nested pattern** `<repo>/<lane>-impl/`. Sibling paths force fallback to `/private/tmp/` and the work disappears from the canonical lane. (In a past audit, lanes that used nested stayed clean; lanes that used sibling all bounced through `/tmp`.)
- **Session-Id trailer** — install a `prepare-commit-msg` hook that recovers the SID by matching the lane's cwd against `~/.codex/sessions/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/rollout-*.jsonl` first-record `payload.cwd`.

### 13. Compact-survivable continuity — grand-project snapshot

The session cache (`last-state.json`) captures **active lanes**. The snapshot below captures the **in-flight orchestrator thread** — grand-project name + phase, recurring user guidance, orchestrator-side decisions, pending user actions. Without it, a `/compact` (Claude) or auto-summary (Codex) drops the thread and the user has to re-prime every continuation. See `prompts/grand-project-snapshot.md` for the schema and what NOT to put in it.

**File**: `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/orchestrator-runs/grand-project-snapshot.json` — one per project, latest-wins.

**Pre-compact (Claude)**:

1. Mine the JSONL via Haiku to extract `user_recurring_guidance` + `in_flight_decisions` (the same agent dispatch as state mining, with a different prompt focus — see `prompts/grand-project-snapshot.md`).
2. Write the snapshot file.
3. Self-register the post-compact hook in the project's `.claude/settings.local.json` (idempotent — same pattern as `spec-review`):

   ```python
   # SessionStart matcher=compact → <this skill's dir>/scripts/orchestrator-resume.sh
   # (resolves via the installed skill path, e.g. ~/.claude/skills/orchestrator/scripts/orchestrator-resume.sh)
   ```

4. Tell the user to run `/compact preserve grand-project context — see snapshot`.

**Post-compact (Claude)**: hook fires automatically, injects a continuation pointing at the snapshot. The orchestrator reads it, re-runs the Haiku state miner, and presents a one-paragraph "resumed" summary before responding to the user's incoming prompt.

**Codex variant**: no `/compact` slash command and no SessionStart hook. Adapt:
- Write the snapshot file proactively after every significant routing decision (lane retire, lane spawn, P0 escalation) — defensive against unplanned summary.
- When a context summary banner appears in the conversation (Codex auto-compaction), READ the snapshot before the next routing claim. The codex-sessions miner picks up the snapshot path automatically when re-orienting.

**Anti-pattern**: writing transcripts or full session JSONLs into the snapshot. The snapshot stays small (~2-5 KB). If you're tempted to add a 12th `user_recurring_guidance` entry, the durable ones belong in `MEMORY.md` instead.

### 14. Model & effort routing per lane

State-miner emits `recommended_model` + `recommended_effort` per lane in `last-state.json`. Surface in survey + lane spawn prompts. Full matrix: `prompts/model-routing.md`.

Effort is per-turn (Claude: keyword; Codex: session-level reasoning level — Low/Medium/High/Extra high, switchable mid-session via Codex menu).

Rules:
1. Subagents default to cheap tier (Haiku / gpt-5.4-mini). State miner always cheap-tier.
2. Effort costs tokens; only apply where matrix says.
3. Respect `model_override` in `last-state.json[<sid>]`.
4. Mailbox-idle is free; don't retire to "save tokens."
5. Cross-runtime second-opinion (flagship Claude + flagship Codex on `/spec-review`, `/codex` review) is the one rational flagship double-up.

**Surfaced in every survey output:** the per-lane recommendation, plus a
top-of-output summary line `Cost watch: N lanes on the flagship tier that matrix says should be mid/cheap tier — review with user.`

### 15. Lane discipline — tier-aware merge gate

Aligned with the §11a tier policy. An earlier blanket rule was "lane sessions never run `gh pr merge`." That correctly prevented lanes from merging red-CI PRs but made the orchestrator a bottleneck on safe docs-only merges (a docs PR once sat ~14 min idle waiting for a manual merge). The tier-aware version:

- **Tier A (docs-only, all CI green or skipped, no review comments, no Depends-on pending) — lane session may run `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` itself and continue post-merge phases.** Docs-only PRs are safe-by-construction: a `pre-push` hook can already enforce the path regex, and branch protection enforces CLEAN + CI. The lane is just executing what the operator would have run anyway.
- **Tier B (single-lane code, all CI green, reviewer findings applied, no cross-lane impact, no security touch) — orchestrator auto-merges on standing approval (label `auto-merge-ok` or `auto-merge-ok-<class>` on the issue).** Eligibility decided by `auto-merge-eligible.sh` predicate (see above). Operator can relax for a specific PR by adding the label retroactively, or refine the predicate by editing the script.
- **Tier C (cross-lane / security-class / schema / breaking / unresolved-review) — lane STOPs after PR open + CI quote-back. Orchestrator delegates a review-merge subagent that does the diff review, applies reviewer findings, and merges (admin-bypass when CI is structurally absent). Stop conditions for the agent: (a) merge conflict, (b) open CHANGES_REQUESTED review, (c) demonstrably broken branch.** Per a standing operator directive, merging is no longer a blocker — only conflicts are. In a past incident two PRs were merged with red CI because the lane decided "no required checks reported = license to merge" — Tier C still exists to gate *who* merges (review-merge agent, not the impl session) and to enforce the diff-review pass, but the operator-handoff stop has been removed.
- **Branch protection is the structural backstop.** Before recommending parallel lane work on a project, verify required status checks exist: `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/branches/main/protection 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.required_status_checks.contexts'`. If absent, flag as a setup gap — the workflow assumes platform enforcement of CI green before merge.
- **Post-push CI quote-back.** Lane prompts must instruct: after `git push`, run `gh pr checks <N>` (or `gh pr view <N> --json statusCheckRollup`) and quote the rollup back before claiming "done". Even when the lane can't merge, surfacing CI state to the operator closes the loop.
- **No `/tmp/` source-of-truth.** Reinforces directive #10.7 — workers occasionally fall back to `/private/tmp/` under sandbox restriction. Lane prompts must explicitly forbid `/tmp/` and `/private/tmp/` for any artifact that should survive the session.

## Issue management — keep the backlog persistent

The project board + issue tracker IS the backlog. Memories are mortal (they grow stale, conflict, get pruned); issues are durable (they survive across sessions, machines, weeks). When a new piece of work surfaces — a bug, a tech debt, an emergent follow-up — **create an issue immediately** with full triage metadata. Don't trust yourself to "remember" it later. (If your team uses a different tracker than GitHub Issues as the source of truth, create the issue there and keep the GitHub PR backlinked to it — adapt the `gh issue`-based commands below to your tracker's CLI/MCP.)

### Required labels on every issue

Every new issue needs:
- **Type label**: `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `regression-test`, `tech-debt`, `spec-review`, or a `spec:<name>` label for spec-specific tracking
- **Priority label**: `priority/p0` (critical / drop everything), `priority/p1` (this week), `priority/p2` (this month), `priority/p3` (backlog)
- **Effort label**: `effort/s` (under half day), `effort/m` (0.5-2 days), `effort/l` (2-5 days), `effort/xl` (over a week, multi-PR)

### Project board (per project)

Every project should have a single GitHub project board (give it a descriptive title and own it under your repo's user/org). The board needs custom fields beyond default Status:
- **Priority** (single-select: P0/P1/P2/P3)
- **Effort** (single-select: S/M/L/XL)
- **Target Date** (date)

**Field IDs are discovered automatically by `bootstrap.py`.** Adding custom fields requires `gh auth refresh -s project` once per machine — bootstrap.py detects the missing scope and prints the refresh command. After the scope is granted, bootstrap.py fetches the project, lists fields, verifies labels, and writes everything to `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/orchestrator-cache.json`. Issue creation reads from the cache; no hardcoded IDs anywhere in the skill.

### Issue creation pattern

Use `prompts/issue-template.md` as the base. Every body must include:
- **Background** — what surfaced this issue, when, in which session
- **Root cause** if known — file path + behavior
- **Acceptance criteria** — checkboxable list, scoped to one PR
- **File refs** — anchor paths so the implementing session knows where to start
- **Related** — memory references, prior PRs/issues, soak issue links
- For latent bugs: a `### Why we need a regression test` section
- For tech debt: a clear "Why this matters" + estimated impact

### Querying the backlog

Standard queries the orchestrator runs at session start or when planning:

```bash
# All P1 (this week) work, sorted by issue number
gh issue list --label priority/p1 --state open

# Cross-reference issues with active sessions' surfaces
gh issue list --label "spec:visual-system" --state open

# Recently created (for triage gap detection)
gh issue list --state open --limit 100 --json number,title,labels,createdAt --jq '.[] | select((.createdAt | fromdateiso8601) > (now - 86400))'

# By repo + project, with Priority/Effort/Target sorted
gh project item-list <number> --owner <owner> --limit 200 --format json
```

### Sync rules

When a PR merges:
1. Read its body for `Closes #N` trailers — those issues auto-close, but verify
2. Identify any **subsumed but not auto-closed** issues — same surface as the PR's diff. Close manually with a comment linking the PR
3. Move project items to **Status=Done** explicitly (auto-close doesn't always update project Status)
4. If the merged PR opened follow-up TODOs (e.g. "Stage 4b deferred from Stage 4"), create a new issue immediately with proper labels — don't let them slip into "I'll remember"

When a new pattern / tech debt / latent bug surfaces during orchestration:
1. Create issue immediately, even if you can't act on it now
2. Apply triage labels in the same `gh issue create` call: `--label "bug,priority/p2,effort/s"`
3. Add to project: `--project "<project name>"`
4. Set custom fields via `gh project item-edit` (Priority + Effort + Target Date)
5. Cross-reference in any related memory entries

### Avoid issue rot

- **No untriaged issues** — every open issue has all three labels (type, priority, effort) within an hour of creation
- **Stale P1s** — re-check P1s weekly; they should have a target date within 2 weeks. If older, demote to P2 with reason
- **Closed-but-not-archived** — once a sprint settles, sweep closed issues that were P1/P2 and ensure their PRs are linked back

### Real cost of skipping issue management

In a single busy session the user identified several distinct strands of work — architectural map work, a fingerprint-hardening fix, a regression test, a hydration bug, a rollout tracker — all of which would have been lost mid-session if not captured as issues. Memory-only would have surfaced 2-3 of them at most. The issue tracker captured all of them.

## Tools you rely on

| Skill | Use |
|---|---|
| `claude-sessions` | Live session list + cross-session main timeline + per-session survey |
| `spec-review` | Multi-model spec verification — invoke in fresh sessions, not orchestrator |
| `spec-test-plan` | Generate multi-tier test plan from finalized spec — sessions invoke between spec-review fixes and writing-plans |
| `spec-test-execute` | Execute the test plan tier-by-tier — sessions invoke after implementation, before opening PR |
| `superpowers:writing-plans` | Plan generation — sessions invoke after spec approval |
| `superpowers:executing-plans` | Step-by-step execution — sessions invoke after plan approval |
| `gh` CLI | Issues, PRs, project board, labels |
| `git` (read-only mostly) | State checks; only commit/push from orchestrator for tiny doc/orchestration commits |

## Tools you DO NOT use directly

- Don't run installs, test suites, or deploys (`npm install`, `npm test`, `cdk deploy`, `vercel deploy`, etc.) — sessions do that
- Don't edit feature code — surface the change as a prompt for a session
- Don't run `/spec-review` or `superpowers:executing-plans` from orchestrator — fresh session

## Generating session prompts

Use `prompts/session-template.md` as the base. The spawn is **two paste actions**:

**Paste 1 — initial prompt.** Must include:

1. Goal one-liner starting with `ship X` / `fix X` / `implement X` / `build X` (purpose-hint extraction)
2. Issue reference (`gh issue view N`)
3. Worktree setup: `git worktree add ../<slug> -b <branch> origin/main`
4. Background — 2-4 memory refs the session reads first to skip rediscovery
5. Scope **with owned-path declarations** — each bullet pairs a goal with the file paths/globs it will write to. The orchestrator registers these in `last-state.json` under the session's `owned_paths` array so sibling lanes consulting state see them.
6. Hard constraints — DO-NOT-TOUCH paths owned by other sessions
7. Session-Id trailer + UNQUOTED heredoc warning
8. Verify command before push (your project's verify gate — the command your project documents)
9. PR title format
10. PR body must include `Closes #N` + test-spec decision rationale + `Depends on #M` if the lane consumes another lane's pending PR
11. State-awareness preamble — one paragraph telling the session that the /loop directive will run BEFORE-tick checks (consult `last-state.json`, poll depends-on PRs, check sibling activity on shared files, push after every commit)

**Paste 2 — `/loop 5m <continuation>`.** Copy verbatim from `prompts/loop-directive.md`. The directive performs 4 BEFORE-each-tick state-awareness checks: (1) consult `~/.claude/projects/*/orchestrator-runs/last-state.json` for sibling lanes; (2) poll depends-on PR's `mergedAt`; (3) check sibling activity on out-of-scope files via `git log --since='2h'`; (4) `git push` after every commit so the orchestrator's 5-min surveys catch the lane's state within one tick. Tune cadence per phase (5m default, 10m for steady-state with longer per-iteration work, 15m for long-running implementation; minimum 3m).

**Orchestrator-side bookkeeping after Paste 1 is acknowledged.** Update `last-state.json` for the new session: add an entry with `name`, `purpose_hint`, `owned_paths` (from Scope), `depends_on_issues` (if any), `lifecycle_step: 1` (or 2 if spec already exists), `lifecycle_label`. Sibling lanes' BEFORE-tick consults will see this within their next loop tick (≤5 min) and self-coordinate.

Do NOT embed a "## Loop directive" paragraph in the initial prompt — that's the old pattern. The harness owns cadence now.

## Memory references (per-project)

Project memories live at `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/MEMORY.md`. The orchestrator pattern depends on these conventions being captured. Key memories this pattern leans on (names are conventions — adapt to your own memory files):

- `feedback_session_naming_convention` — NAME not SID
- `feedback_session_id_trailer_heredoc` — heredoc quoting
- `feedback_spec_to_implementation_same_session` — lifecycle in one session
- `feedback_main_auto_push_collision` — stash before commit, parallel push discipline
- `reference_soak_tracking_via_github_issues` — soak issue conventions
- plus any project-specific references for your deploy/migration/auth patterns and the canonical repo location + frozen-branch facts

When you encounter a NEW pattern that should persist across orchestrator sessions, **route it by scope** (below) — never append per-run to this repo's committed `LEARNINGS.md`.

## Skill Memory (LEARNINGS)

**Read at start:** this skill's committed `LEARNINGS.md` (curated seed of cross-session orchestration patterns) + the private overlay if present (`~/.claude/skills-overlay/orchestrator/LEARNINGS.md`).

**Write at end — route by scope, NEVER append to the committed seed here** (full routing: [`docs/skill-memory.md`](../../../docs/skill-memory.md)):
- **Operator-private orchestration craft** (a tool bug like claude-sessions/codex CLI, a heredoc-quoting convention, a false-positive-test failure mode during a multi-PR push window, an over-parallelizing / lane-collision anti-pattern) → `~/.claude/skills-overlay/orchestrator/LEARNINGS.md` (create if absent).
- **Project-specific facts** → the project's `.claude/memory/`.
- **Universal craft worth publishing** → note it for `/improve-harness` to promote (de-identified) into the seed via PR.

Also read the private overlay if present: `~/.claude/skills-overlay/orchestrator/LEARNINGS.md` (adopter-private; never in this public repo). It holds the dated, incident-specific cross-session lessons the maintainer has accumulated; the generic skill works standalone without it, and picks it up automatically when present.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Running installs or implementing code in orchestrator
- ❌ Spawning agents for implementation when a fresh session is more appropriate (sessions have their own context window; agents share orchestrator's)
- ❌ Opening 5+ implementation lanes when 4 are already running (usage-limit risk + merge collision risk)
- ❌ Using SIDs instead of NAMEs in narrative
- ❌ Forgetting to add DO-NOT-TOUCH list to new lane prompts
- ❌ Trying to fix the orchestrator's local main divergence without first stashing other-session WT
- ❌ Generating prompts without the loop directive — sessions then ping for tiny decisions
- ❌ Skipping spec-test-plan because "this feels straightforward" — apply the rubric mechanically; the cost of running it is small, the cost of skipping it on a feature is incident response
- ❌ Treating TDD-during-implementation as a substitute for spec-test-execute — test-runner passing ≠ tier marker. The plan file must have explicit `PASS / FAIL / SKIP / BLOCKED` markers committed before merge. (A past data-path PR was the failure case that surfaced this gap.)
- ❌ Marking test plan tiers PASS without running them, or SKIP without a justification + fallback attempt
- ❌ Inferring tier outcomes from test-runner output during the merge gate — the gate reads explicit markers from the committed plan file, never infers
- ❌ Silently skipping prod-data tiers (Deploy, E2E) — must either run on staging or be explicitly deferred in the plan file with rationale (e.g. "Phase 10 held until user authorization per spec §6")
- ❌ Opening a PR while test plan tiers are still FAIL or unjustified-SKIP — the merge readiness gate exists specifically to prevent this
- ❌ Trusting chat-text signals (`last_assistant_tail`, "Exiting.", JSONL silence) over branch HEAD when classifying session lifecycle — branch movement is the authoritative signal
- ❌ Answering "what's remaining in Spec X" from an issue tracker body — read the spec file directly; tracker bodies decay
- ❌ Letting a session retire with "now-runnable-post-deploy" markers still DEFERRED-skeleton — those markers are promises, must be redeemed before retire
- ❌ Conflating staging E2E (Tier 3a) with prod E2E (Tier 3b) — they're distinct markers; one covering "all E2E" hides scope
- ❌ Stating "PR #N merged" inside a generated prompt because a worker said so or a commit looks recent — `gh pr view <N> --json mergedAt,state` is the only authority. In a past incident a Codex orchestrator emitted "Pricing already merged" into a rebase prompt while the PR had never even been created (gh API was down at the time of the worker's claim).
- ❌ Treating subagent reports as canonical without re-running the final command in the lane's worktree — a worker's "done" with `/tmp/` paths or sandbox-blocked writes is not a deliverable. Re-validate per directive #10.7.
- ❌ State-miner re-emitting an unchanged session list — if survey == cache, return one line. Paying full agent cost on identical data is waste.
