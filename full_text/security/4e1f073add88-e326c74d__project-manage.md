name: project-manage
description: Use this skill to manage the entire project workflow, orchestrating specialized agents (functional analyst, API architect, UI/UX designer) to ensure proper analysis, design, implementation, and review of all tasks. Handles both new features and bug fixes with appropriate workflows. Examples: "Start working on the project", "Implement the next task", "Fix the authentication bug".

# Manage Project

## ⛔ STOP: READ THIS FIRST

**THE PROJECT ROOT IS REPORTED BY RELEASE-MANAGER.**

**FIRST ACTION: Delegate to release-manager to get project state.**

```
Agent({
  subagent_type: "c3:release-manager",
  prompt: "Report project state",
  description: "Get project state"
})
```

The release-manager will report:
- **Working Directory** (project root)
- **Project Type** (Website or Software)
- Current branch
- Open PRs and their status
- Open issues
- Recent commits
- Last tag

**Use the working directory from the report as the project root.**

**IGNORE:**
- Any "base directory" from skill loading
- Any paths in PERSONAL.md
- Any paths in memory files
- Any paths shown in git status from previous conversations
- Any absolute paths to ~/Workspace/agentic/c3/ or ~/Workspace/agentic/incubator/

**ONLY USE:**
- The working directory from release-manager's report
- All file paths are relative to that output: TODO.md, PLAN.md, analysis/, reporting/

---

## Role of this skill

`project-manage` is a **coordinator**. It never touches Bash, git, or `gh`
directly — all source-control and GitHub operations are delegated to
`c3:release-manager` (the controlled Bash funnel). It detects what kind of work
this is, routes it to the right sub-workflow, and drives a feature through
analysis → design → consensus → implementation → review → PR.

It owns Phases 0–5. Three phases are delegated to dedicated sub-skills:

| Phase | Sub-skill | Trigger |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 6 — PR iteration | `c3:project-handle-pr` | "follow up on PR #N" or open PR with feedback |
| 7 — Post-merge | `c3:project-post-merge` | Owner reports a PR was merged |
| Review cycle (5.6, 6.4) | `c3:project-review` | Invoked during implementation and PR iteration |

A hard rule runs through the whole skill: **the repository owner is the only
human decision-maker.** The agent proposes; the owner approves via PR comments
(not AskUserQuestion); only the owner merges.

---

## Workflow Overview

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 0 — Session Start & Triage
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 0.1  release-manager → project state report (project root = its wd)
 0.2  branch on state:
        open PR w/ feedback    → delegate to c3:project-handle-pr
        open PR waiting        → report & wait
        merged feature branch  → delegate to c3:project-post-merge
        open issues            → 0.3 issue triage
        clean main/master      → Phase 1
 0.3  issue triage (by type/label — all gh ops via release-manager):
        bug        → Bug Implementation Flow (bug-fixer → project-review → PR)
        feature    → functional-analyst review → owner approves → backlog
        question   → researcher
        dependency → researcher → backlog
        reject     → close

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 1 — Analysis (conditional)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 1A  no analysis/functional.md → functional-analyst: interview,
     create analysis/functional.md + TODO.md + (optional) PLAN.md (MBIs)
 1B  analysis exists, no TODO  → functional-analyst: review,
     create prioritized TODO.md (+ PLAN.md MBIs if needed)
     (researcher conditional: gaps / tech choices; see c3:plan for MBIs)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 2 — Task Selection
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 2.1  unsorted items (TODO.md ## Unsorted) & unsorted MBIs
      (PLAN.md ## Unsorted MBIs) → ask: sort / analyze / skip
 2.2  PRIORITY (first-class):
        1. Active MBI tasks   (PLAN.md ## Active MBI, tagged [MBI-XXX])
        2. Fix issues          (critical bugs)
        3. Linear TODO.md backlog
 2.3  verify task not already implemented (acceptance-criteria check)
 2.4  propose next task (AskUserQuestion) → approved → 2.5
 2.5  task scope classification:
        backend | frontend | full | docs | research
        (+ security-engineer if auth / PII / external API / input / files / config)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 3 — Cross-Domain Design Review (parallel, by scope)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 3.1  api-architect + security-engineer   (backend / full)
 3.2  ui-ux-designer                       (frontend / full)
      each writes analysis/*.md; TODO.md updates flow via functional-analyst

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 4 — Consensus
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 4.1  reporting/{task}/consensus.md — all invoked domain agents approve

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 5 — Implementation
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 5.1  release-manager: feature branch + commit analysis docs + draft PR
 5.2  post implementation plan as PR comment
 5.3  ◆ PLAN APPROVAL GATE (BLOCKING — owner in PR comments)
 5.4  check domain skills first (textual / pymongo / baseweb / python …)
 5.5  python-developer implements (incremental: one change → test → verify)
 5.6  ★ invoke c3:project-review skill
 5.7  mark pending-review + write reporting/{task}/summary.md
 5.8  release-manager: commit → push → PR → CI (fix until green)
 5.9  release-manager: mark ready → assign / request owner review
 5.10 PAUSE (do not poll for feedback)

 → "follow up on PR #N" → delegate to c3:project-handle-pr
 → "PR merged"          → delegate to c3:project-post-merge
```

The review cycle detail (Stage a–f, the `make check` gate, rejection handling)
lives in the `c3:project-review` skill, invoked at 5.6 and again (scoped) at
Phase 6.4 of `c3:project-handle-pr`.

---

## Session Start: Get Project State

**CRITICAL: Project-manager does NOT run git/gh commands directly. Always delegate to release-manager.**

```
Agent({
  subagent_type: "c3:release-manager",
  prompt: "Report project state",
  description: "Get project state"
})
```

Based on the state reported, determine the next action (Phase 0.2):

| State | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Open PR with pending feedback | Delegate to `c3:project-handle-pr` |
| Open PR waiting for owner | Report status, wait for owner |
| Merged PR on feature branch | Delegate to `c3:project-post-merge` |
| Clean main/master | Start new task from TODO.md (Phase 1) |
| Open issues | Process issues (Phase 0.3) |

### PR Status Handling

The release-manager's report includes PR status. Based on that:

| PR Status | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| CI failing | Delegate to developer to fix |
| CI passing, review pending | Wait for owner |
| Changes requested | Delegate to `c3:project-handle-pr` |
| Approved | Wait for owner to merge |

**Do NOT run `gh pr checks` or `gh pr view` directly — get this from release-manager.**

---

## Task Type Detection

Before starting, detect whether the task is a **feature**, **bug**, or **dependency**:

| Task Type | Indicators |
|-----------|------------|
| **Bug** | "fix", "bug", "issue", "broken", "error", "doesn't work", "crash", "fails" |
| **Feature** | "add", "create", "implement", "build", "new", "feature", "enhance" |
| **Dependency** | "upgrade", "update", "bump", "dependencies", "package", "release", "version" |

### If the task is a BUG

Follow the **Bug Implementation Flow** below — bugs go through the same review
(`c3:project-review`) and PR funnel (`c3:release-manager`) as features, but skip
the Plan Approval Gate (bugs are urgent and owner-decided). See
[references/bug-workflow-integration.md](references/bug-workflow-integration.md).

#### Bug Implementation Flow

```
1. Mark in-progress + create feature branch   (release-manager)
2. Spawn c3:bug-fixer                          (diagnose + TDD + fix + make check → reports back)
3. Invoke c3:project-review (scoped to bug)    ← review re-entry, same as features
4. Commit, push, PR, CI                        (release-manager)
5. Mark ready, request owner review            (release-manager)
6. PAUSE                                       (do not poll)
   → "PR merged" → c3:project-post-merge
```

**Step 1 — Mark in-progress + create branch** (release-manager):

```python
Agent({ subagent_type: "c3:release-manager",
  prompt: "Add label 'status:in-progress' to issue #{number}. If on main/master, create and checkout feature branch: feature/{issue-number}-{short-description}.",
  description: "Mark bug in progress + branch" })
```

**Step 2 — Spawn bug-fixer** (diagnose + TDD + fix + `make check`; reports back,
does NOT create a PR or run review):

```python
Agent({ subagent_type: "c3:bug-fixer",
  prompt: "Fix {issue-number}: {issue-title}\n\n{issue-body}",
  description: "Fix bug {issue-number}" })
```

**Step 3 — Review the fix** (invoke the shared review skill, scoped to the bug,
using the scope/files from bug-fixer's report):

```
Skill({ skill: "c3:project-review",
  args: "bug fix, issue #{number}, scope {scope}, round 0, files: {from report}" })
```

| `c3:project-review` returns | Action |
|------------------------------|--------|
| `approved` | Proceed to Step 4 |
| `rejected: <feedback>` | Re-spawn bug-fixer (Step 2) with the feedback to revise; increment round; re-run Step 3 |
| `escalate` | Ask owner: proceed with known issues / reduce scope / alternative? |

**Step 4 — Commit, push, PR, CI** (release-manager, same as Phase 5.8):

```python
Agent({ subagent_type: "c3:release-manager",
  prompt: "Commit the fix with message: 'fix: {summary} (#{issue-number})'. Push and create PR titled 'fix: {title}' referencing issue #{number}.",
  description: "Commit, push, create PR" })
Agent({ subagent_type: "c3:release-manager",
  prompt: "Check CI status for PR #{number}. If failing, report details.",
  description: "Check CI" })
```

If CI fails, re-spawn bug-fixer to fix, then release-manager commits/pushes again.

**Step 5 — Mark ready, request owner review** (release-manager, same as Phase 5.9).

**Step 6 — Pause** (same as Phase 5.10). On "PR merged" → delegate to
`c3:project-post-merge`.

### If the task is a DEPENDENCY

Determine complexity, then route:

| Complexity | Example | Workflow |
|------------|---------|----------|
| Simple upgrade | "Upgrade yoker to 2.1.0" | Researcher → python-developer |
| Upgrade with goal | "Upgrade yoker to simplify our codebase" | Researcher → functional-analyst |

```python
# Step 1: researcher gathers package information (uses pkgq for Python packages)
Agent({
  subagent_type: "c3:researcher",
  prompt: "Research Python packages: {packages}. Include: capabilities, patterns, breaking changes, migration steps.",
  description: "Research {packages}"
})

# Step 2: route based on complexity
#   simple upgrade  → c3:python-developer (apply migration)
#   upgrade w/ goal → c3:functional-analyst (analyze simplification, create TODO.md)
```

### If the task is a FEATURE

Use the **Feature Development Workflow** — continue to Phase 0.3 / Phase 1.

---

## Phase 0.3 — Issue Triage

⛔ **MANDATORY: uses data from release-manager's project state report. Do NOT run gh commands directly.**

Issues are reported by release-manager during session start. Filter out issues
with status labels (already reviewed); issues without status labels are new and
need triage. Classify each new issue:

| Issue Type | Labels / Indicators | Workflow |
|------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Bug** | `bug`, `error`, `crash`, `broken`, `fix` | Bug Implementation Flow (bug-fixer → project-review → PR) |
| **Feature** | `enhancement`, `feature`, `new`, `add` | Review → Clarify → Backlog |
| **Question** | `question`, `help`, `discussion` | Research or close |
| **Dependencies** | `dependencies`, `upgrade` | Research → Backlog |

Detailed triage (owner authority, clarification process, triage completion) is
in [references/issue-review-workflow.md](references/issue-review-workflow.md).

### Bug issues (URGENT — immediate action)

Do NOT ask for confirmation. Follow the **Bug Implementation Flow** (see "If the
task is a BUG" above): mark in-progress + create branch (release-manager) →
spawn `c3:bug-fixer` → `c3:project-review` → commit/push/PR/CI (release-manager)
→ mark ready → pause. Bugs no longer stop at the bug-fixer; they continue
through the same review + PR funnel as features.

### Feature issues (REQUIRE review — clarify first)

⚠️ **Only the repository owner can approve an issue into the backlog.**
Non-owner comments are informational only. Functional-analyst must verify
commenter ownership. Full process in
[references/issue-review-workflow.md](references/issue-review-workflow.md).

1. Mark as being reviewed (release-manager adds `status:in-progress` + comment).
2. Delegate to functional-analyst for review (clarify via `gh issue comment`).
3. After functional-analyst reports **owner** agreement:
   - release-manager: remove `status:in-progress`, add `status:backlog`, comment.
   - functional-analyst: add issue to TODO.md backlog with agreed criteria.
4. Commit and push TODO.md/REQUIREMENTS.md updates immediately via release-manager
   (prevents accumulating uncommitted changes during triage).

### Question / discussion issues

```python
Agent({ subagent_type: "c3:release-manager",
  prompt: "Add label 'status:needs-research' to issue #{number} and comment 'Needs evaluation for...'",
  description: "Mark for research" })
```

### Rejecting issues

```python
Agent({ subagent_type: "c3:release-manager",
  prompt: "Add label 'status:wont-do' to issue #{number} and close with comment 'Closing: not in scope because...'",
  description: "Reject issue" })
```

### Issue status labels

| Label | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `status:backlog` | Reviewed, accepted, added to TODO.md | Keep open, implement later |
| `status:in-progress` | Currently being reviewed or implemented | Keep open, track progress |
| `status:wont-do` | Decision: won't implement | Close with explanation |
| `status:needs-research` | Needs evaluation | Keep open, research first |
| `status:blocked` | Blocked by dependency | Keep open, note blocker |

### "Follow up on issue #N"

⚠️ **Do NOT decide yourself. Delegate to functional-analyst.** Use `SendMessage`
with the existing functional-analyst agent to preserve context — do not relaunch.

The functional-analyst checks for new comments, verifies ownership, and reports
one of: needs clarification / waiting for owner / fully triaged. After triage is
complete, update labels and TODO.md via release-manager + functional-analyst, then
move to the next issue (do not pause for feedback).

Continue to Phase 1 after issues are handled.

---

## Phase 1 — Analysis (conditional)

Detect the project state from analysis artifacts:

| State | `analysis/functional.md` | `TODO.md` | Action |
|-------|--------------------------|-----------|--------|
| **New Project** | Missing | Missing | Phase 1A |
| **Incomplete Setup** | Exists | Missing | Phase 1B |
| **Ready for Work** | Exists | Exists | Phase 2 |

### Phase 1A — Initial Functional Analysis (new project)

Invoke `functional-analyst` to:

- Review high-level functional requirements (README.md, existing docs)
- Review existing code structure if available
- Interview the user to clarify topics needing more information
- Create `analysis/functional.md` with comprehensive functional analysis
- Create `TODO.md` with a prioritized backlog of atomic, well-defined tasks
- **Optionally create `PLAN.md`** with Minimal Business Increments (MBIs) when
  the work benefits from MBI-level slicing. Use the `c3:plan` skill for MBI
  creation, scoring (WSJF), and structure.

**Conditional: invoke `c3:researcher` when:**
- Functional analysis identifies gaps needing best-practice proposals
- The user explicitly requests research to address functional-analyst questions
- A technology choice needs evaluation and recommendations

Researcher delivers: findings in `research/{topic}.md`, technology
recommendations with pros/cons, best-practice proposals for identified gaps.

### Phase 1B — Review and Backlog Creation (existing analysis)

Invoke `functional-analyst` to:

- Review existing `analysis/functional.md`
- Review current project state
- Interview the user to update understanding if needed
- Create a prioritized `TODO.md`
- **Create/update `PLAN.md`** with MBIs if the work warrants MBI slicing

**Conditional: invoke researcher** when existing analysis needs technology
investigation or the user requests research.

Then proceed to **Task Scope Classification** (Phase 2.5).

---

## Phase 2 — Task Selection

### 2.1 Check for unsorted items and MBIs

- Read `TODO.md` — check for a `## Unsorted` section (quick ideas captured but
  not yet analyzed).
- If `PLAN.md` exists, check for `## Unsorted MBIs` (raw MBI ideas not yet
  analyzed).

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| No unsorted items or MBIs | Proceed to 2.2 |
| Unsorted items / MBIs exist | Ask the user (AskUserQuestion): sort / analyze / skip / show all |

Choices:
- **Sort unsorted items first** → functional-analyst integrates them into the backlog
- **Analyze unsorted MBIs** → functional-analyst creates proper MBI entries in PLAN.md
- **Show next backlog task** → proceed to 2.2
- **Show all items** → display TODO.md and PLAN.md, ask again

### 2.2 Priority (MBI is first-class)

| Priority | Task Source |
|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Active MBI tasks (PLAN.md `## Active MBI`, tagged `[MBI-XXX]` in TODO.md) |
| 2 | Fix issues (critical bugs) |
| 3 | Linear TODO.md backlog |

If an Active MBI exists, propose its first incomplete task and report the MBI
context to the user (e.g. "Found Active MBI: MBI-001 — Bootstrap. Next task: …").
Active MBI tasks take priority over non-MBI tasks.

### 2.3 Verify task completion status (CRITICAL)

Before proposing a task, verify whether its acceptance criteria are already
satisfied by existing code — this prevents proposing already-implemented work.

- Does the task require creating a file that already exists?
- Are the acceptance criteria already met by current code?
- Are there related "done" tasks covering this functionality?

If the task appears already implemented: mark it done in TODO.md with today's
date, move to the next task, and report to the user.

### 2.4 Propose next task (AskUserQuestion)

```
Question: "Project analysis complete. Next task from backlog: {task-id} - {task-title}. Proceed with this task?"
Options:
- "Yes, start implementation" (Recommended)
- "Show all tasks in backlog"
- "Run fresh analysis"
```

If approved, proceed to 2.5.

### 2.5 Task scope classification

| Scope | Indicators | Required Domain Agents |
|-------|------------|------------------------|
| **Backend only** | "API", "endpoint", "backend", "data model", no UI | api-architect, security-engineer* |
| **Frontend only** | "UI", "UX", "frontend", "component", "page", no backend | ui-ux-designer |
| **Full stack** | Both backend and frontend mentioned | api-architect, ui-ux-designer, security-engineer* |
| **Documentation only** | "document", "readme", "guide" | end-user-documenter |
| **Research only** | "research", "investigate", "evaluate" | researcher |

\* Include `security-engineer` when the task involves: authentication or
authorization changes, sensitive data (PII, credentials, payments), external API
integrations, user input processing, file operations, or security-affecting
configuration changes.

Then proceed to Phase 3.

---

## Phase 3 — Cross-Domain Design Review

Invoke domain agents based on scope. Run them **in parallel** where independent.

**Backend / Full stack:** `api-architect` (+ `security-engineer` if security-related)
**Frontend / Full stack:** `ui-ux-designer`

Each domain agent:
- Reviews the most recent functional analysis and the current backlog (TODO.md)
- Provides its perspective and improvements
- **Creates an analysis document in `analysis/`** (mandatory for api-architect
  and security-engineer)
- Updates TODO.md with domain considerations (flowing through functional-analyst)

---

## Phase 4 — Consensus and Backlog Finalization

- Collect feedback from all domain agents invoked in Phase 3
- Coordinate resolution if agents disagree
- Create a consensus summary in `reporting/{task-name}/consensus.md`
- **Only proceed to implementation when all invoked agents approve**

Not all tasks require all agents — consensus is among the agents that were
invoked.

---

## Phase 5 — Implementation

### 5.1 Create feature branch + commit analysis docs + draft PR

```python
Agent({ subagent_type: "c3:release-manager",
  prompt: "Check current branch. If on main/master, create and checkout feature branch: feature/{issue-number}-{short-description}",
  description: "Create feature branch" })
Agent({ subagent_type: "c3:release-manager",
  prompt: "Stage and commit analysis documents in analysis/ and reporting/ with message: 'docs: add analysis for {task-name}'",
  description: "Commit analysis docs" })
Agent({ subagent_type: "c3:release-manager",
  prompt: "Create draft PR with title 'feat: {task title}' and body describing the analysis. Include links to analysis documents.",
  description: "Create draft PR" })
```

### 5.2 Post implementation plan as PR comment

```python
Agent({ subagent_type: "c3:release-manager",
  prompt: "Post PR comment with implementation plan for {task-name}. Include: approach, files to modify, implementation steps, acceptance criteria. End with 'Waiting for owner approval before proceeding.'",
  description: "Post plan as PR comment" })
```

### 5.3 ◆ Plan Approval Gate (BLOCKING)

⚠️ **Implementation cannot proceed until the repository owner approves the plan
in PR comments. This is mandatory and blocking — not optional, not an
AskUserQuestion.**

Delegate to release-manager to monitor PR comments:

```python
Agent({ subagent_type: "c3:release-manager",
  prompt: "Check PR #{number} for owner feedback. Report any comments or approval.",
  description: "Check PR feedback" })
```

Report to the owner:
```
Implementation plan posted as PR comment. Waiting for your approval before proceeding.
PR: {PR URL}
Please review and either:
- Approve: comment "approved" or "looks good, proceed"
- Request changes: comment with specific feedback
Implementation is blocked until you approve.
```

| Owner response | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| Requests changes | functional-analyst incorporates → release-manager commits → re-post plan → wait again |
| Rejects entirely | Close PR (+ related issue if applicable) → report to owner |
| Approves | Proceed to 5.4 |

**Only proceed to 5.4 after explicit owner approval in PR comments.**

### 5.4 Check domain skills

Before exploring code or running one-off scripts, check for a domain skill:

| Skill | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `textual` | Textual TUI widgets and patterns |
| `rich` | Rich console output |
| `pymongo` | MongoDB operations |
| `fire` | Fire CLI framework |
| `baseweb` / `vuetify` | Web UI frameworks |
| `python` | Python coding standards (always relevant) |

Invoke the matching skill first to get API knowledge and patterns — saves
exploration time.

### 5.5 Implement

Invoke `c3:python-developer` (or appropriate specialized agent) to:
- Implement the task following the plan
- Follow `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`
- Follow domain skills (python, baseweb, fire, pymongo, etc.)
- Run `make check` and verify all pass before reporting done
- Receive task details from TODO.md and relevant analysis documents

**Incremental changes when fixing issues:**
1. Make ONE change at a time — don't batch multiple fixes
2. Test after each change — verify each fix works
3. Restore if broken — if a change breaks working code, restore first
4. Ask before guessing — if unsure about root cause, ask for clarification

**Anti-patterns:** making multiple changes simultaneously; guessing without
understanding root cause; continuing to add changes when already broken; skipping
checks between changes.

### 5.6 Review cycle

⚠️ **MANDATORY. Do not skip.** Invoke the shared review skill:

```
Skill({
  skill: "c3:project-review",
  args: "initial implementation, task {task-id}, scope {scope}, round 0, files: {files}"
})
```

`c3:project-review` runs functional → domain → quality → documentation →
`make check` → pre-commit verification, with rejection handling (max 2 rounds,
then escalate). Handle its return value:

| `c3:project-review` returns | Action |
|------------------------------|--------|
| `approved` | Proceed to 5.7 |
| `rejected: <feedback>` | Send developer back to 5.5 with consolidated feedback; increment round; re-run 5.6 |
| `escalate` | Ask owner: proceed with known issues / reduce scope / alternative approach? |

### 5.7 Mark pending-review + summary

- Mark the task **pending review** (not complete until PR is merged)
- Update the task in TODO.md with the PR reference
- Ensure `reporting/{task-name}/` exists
- Create `reporting/{task-name}/summary.md`: what was implemented, key decisions,
  lessons learned, files modified, PR link

### 5.8 Commit, push, create PR, CI

⚠️ **In project management mode, commits NEVER go directly to master/main.**

```python
Agent({ subagent_type: "c3:release-manager",
  prompt: "Check current branch. If on main/master, create and checkout feature branch: feature/{issue-number}-{short-description}",
  description: "Ensure feature branch" })
Agent({ subagent_type: "c3:release-manager",
  prompt: "Commit all staged changes with message: 'feat: {description}'",
  description: "Commit changes" })
Agent({ subagent_type: "c3:release-manager",
  prompt: "Push branch to origin and create PR with title 'feat: {task title}' and body describing changes. Include task reference #{task-id} and issue #{issue-number}.",
  description: "Push and create PR" })
Agent({ subagent_type: "c3:release-manager",
  prompt: "Add label 'status:in-progress' to issue #{issue-number} and add comment 'PR created: {PR URL}'",
  description: "Update issue status" })
```

**CI follow-up (MANDATORY):** PR creation is NOT complete until CI passes.

```python
Agent({ subagent_type: "c3:release-manager",
  prompt: "Check CI status for PR #{number}. Report if passing or failing. If failing, provide failure details.",
  description: "Check CI status" })
```

If CI fails: delegate to developer to fix → release-manager commits and pushes →
repeat until CI passes.

### 5.9 Mark PR ready, assign, request review

```python
Agent({ subagent_type: "c3:release-manager",
  prompt: "Mark PR #{number} as ready for review (convert from draft).",
  description: "Mark PR ready" })
Agent({ subagent_type: "c3:release-manager",
  prompt: "Assign PR #{number} to {owner} and request review from {owner}. Post comment: 'Implementation complete. Ready for review.'",
  description: "Assign and request review" })
```

### 5.10 Pause and report

⚠️ **Do NOT check for feedback immediately. The workflow pauses here.**

Report to the owner:
```
PR #{number} is ready for review.
URL: {PR URL}
Status:
- Implementation: Complete
- CI: Passing
- Review: Requested from {owner}
The PR is ready for your review. Say "follow up on PR #{number}" to check for feedback.
```

**Do NOT:** check for PR feedback immediately; wait for owner response; block on
feedback.

The workflow ends here for this task. Move to the next issue/PR or pause.

---

## Delegating to sub-skills

After Phase 5.10, control returns to the owner. Two triggers delegate onward:

| Trigger | Delegation |
|---------|------------|
| "follow up on PR #N" / "check PR #N" | `Skill({ skill: "c3:project-handle-pr", args: "PR #N, task {task-id}, scope {scope}" })` |
| Owner reports PR merged | `Skill({ skill: "c3:project-post-merge", args: "PR #N, task {task-id}, issue #{number}" })` |

`c3:project-handle-pr` re-enters the review cycle (scoped) on every feedback
round before push — closing the gap where PR-comment changes previously shipped
without cross-validation. `c3:project-post-merge` runs the sequenced cleanup and
returns control here (Phase 2) for the next task, or delegates to release for a
release.

### Processing multiple issues/PRs

After processing an issue or PR:
1. Check for more items (new issues without status labels; in-progress issues;
   PRs awaiting feedback).
2. If more exist, move to the next and process it — do not check feedback on
   previous items.
3. If all are processed, report a summary ("Processed X issues/PRs. Y items
   waiting for feedback.") and pause. The user says "follow up" to resume.

## Publishing Releases

When the user requests publishing to PyPI or preparing a release, delegate to
release-manager (which invokes the `c3:release` skill): version bump decision,
updating version files, changelog, pre-publish checks, build, tag, GitHub
release, PyPI upload.

```python
Agent({ subagent_type: "c3:release-manager",
  prompt: "Execute release workflow: determine version bump, update files, run checks, build, and publish to PyPI",
  description: "Execute release" })
```

Key checks (handled by release-manager): README image paths use absolute GitHub
URLs; version synced between `pyproject.toml` and `__init__.py`; local dev
config (`[tool.uv.sources]`, `[tool.uv.workspace]`) removed; entry points
verified; package contents verified after build.

All analysis documents go in `analysis/` with sub-folders for organization.

### TODO.md Structure

```markdown
# TODO

## Unsorted

- [ ] Quick idea 1 (captured but not yet analyzed)
- [ ] Quick idea 2 (needs functional analysis)

## Backlog (Prioritized)

### P1 - Critical
- [ ] Critical task with clear acceptance criteria

### P2 - High
- [ ] High priority task

### P3 - Medium
- [ ] Medium priority task

### P4 - Low
- [ ] Low priority task

## Done

- [x] Completed task
```

**Unsorted section rules:** placed at the top; short ideas without acceptance
criteria; functional-analyst moves them into the prioritized Backlog when
analyzed; optional — only present when the user has captured unsorted ideas.

## Notes

- The functional-analyst owns the TODO.md structure; domain agents contribute
  through it.
- Resolve conflicts between domain recommendations based on project priorities.
- Ensure all tasks have verifiable acceptance criteria before implementation.
- **Bugs** → Bug Implementation Flow: `c3:bug-fixer` (diagnose + TDD + fix +
  `make check`, reports back) → `c3:project-review` (scoped) → PR via
  `c3:release-manager`. Same review + PR funnel as features, no Plan Approval Gate.
- **Features** → follow the phases with domain design reviews.
- **Research** is conditional — invoke when gaps identified or technology choices
  needed.
- **MBIs** are first-class: Active MBI tasks take priority over the linear
  backlog. Use `c3:plan` to create/score them.
- **Security review** is scoped to security-related tasks.
- **Documentation** is part of task completion for user-facing changes.
- **Parallel reviews** improve efficiency without sacrificing quality.
- **User can request reanalysis**: use the "Run fresh analysis" option when
  proposing the next task.
- **PR ownership**: the agent creates PRs and processes feedback, but ONLY the
  owner merges PRs. Never propose merging.
- **TODO.md direction is authoritative**: when TODO.md specifies an approach,
  follow it without asking for confirmation. Only ask for clarification when
  genuinely ambiguous or conflicting requirements exist.
- **`make check` is the quality gate**: never authorize a commit while
  `make check` fails. The gate applies to initial implementation (5.6) and to
  every PR-feedback round (6.4 via `c3:project-handle-pr`).

## Communication with the User

- Provide clear status updates at each phase transition
- Report blockers or issues requiring user input
- Summarize agent findings and decisions
- When the project is ready for work, propose the next task from the backlog

### Using AskUserQuestion

**CRITICAL**: when asking the user for input and there are **limited possible
answers (<7)**, use the AskUserQuestion tool instead of plain text prompts. This
applies to task approval, workflow selection, priority decisions, conflict
resolution, branch selection — but **never** to owner-approval gates, which
happen in PR comments.
