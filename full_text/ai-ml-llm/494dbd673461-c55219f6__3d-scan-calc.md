# 3D Scan Calculation

## When to Use

- Calculate volume of complex or noisy 3D meshes
- Filter debris from scan data by isolating largest component
- Extract metadata (material IDs) stored in binary STL files


- Treat task-specific execution rules as mandatory overrides to this skill: if the prompt requires a specific tool/action syntax, completion token, final message format, file path, or schema, follow that exact contract.
- Before the first tool call, check whether the task defines a required invocation format; if it does, use that format consistently for every tool interaction.
- If the environment requires a repeated wrapper format (for example `Thought:` followed by a JSON `Action:` block), use that exact wrapper on every tool call; do not substitute XML-style tool tags, alternate wrapper names, unsupported tool names, or informal pseudo-tool syntax.
- Every action must be directly executable as written. Do not send placeholders such as `inspect the STL header`, `view saved report`, or `read header bytes`; translate intent into a concrete command first.
- Before the final response, re-check for any exact completion requirement (for example a literal token such as `ACTION: TASK_COMPLETE`) and output exactly what the task requires, with no extra prose if the task forbids it.
- Treat protocol compliance as part of correctness: do not let otherwise-correct geometry or mass results fail on wrapper/tool-schema or completion-token noncompliance.
## Basic Workflow

**Default proven pattern for lookup-based mass tasks:** confirm the mesh/input file and every required sidecar/reference file are present, inspect any provided helper and reference table early, extract only the decisive properties from the selected largest geometric component (typically volume + material ID), then perform exact lookup/arithmetic in one reproducible step and verify any written deliverable by reading it back.


1. Inspect the workspace for provided helper scripts/tools that already parse the mesh or compute the requested geometry; prefer validated task-provided or existing mesh-analysis utilities over reimplementing STL parsing or connectivity analysis from scratch.
   - Before computing any derived value, confirm the primary mesh/input file and every required sidecar/reference file (for example density/material tables or schema examples) are actually present and readable in the workspace.
   - If a required reference file is missing or unreadable, stop early and report that blocker instead of proceeding with guessed mappings or partial calculations.
   - Open/read any provided helper script before relying on it so you understand its inputs, outputs, assumptions, and whether it preserves task-relevant metadata such as STL attribute/material IDs.
   - If the task depends on an external lookup file (for example a density table), inspect/read that source early before writing the calculation script so identifiers, units, and expected keys are known up front.
   - Inspect the STL header and a small sample of triangle records early to detect whether embedded metadata (for example, material IDs in attribute bytes) will matter downstream before committing to a geometry-only workflow.
   - Preserve the proven default flow for scan-to-mass tasks: isolate the largest geometric connected component, extract the selected component's structured fields first (at minimum volume and material/attribute ID), resolve that exact ID through the provided reference table, then compute and write the result.
   - If you are using a plan/todo tracker, leave scripting, analysis, and output steps in-progress until the script/tool finishes without error and the resulting values or artifact have been inspected.

   - For binary STL inputs, validate the file structure before detailed parsing: confirm header length, triangle count, and file-size consistency with 84 + 50*n bytes. Use any visible header metadata only after this structural check passes.
   - First confirm that any helper/tool you plan to use is actually available through the current interface, and inspect its expected inputs/outputs before building your workflow around it.
   - Do not switch to unstated tool wrappers or unsupported command conventions.
   - Do not mark analysis, calculation, or output steps as complete until the relevant command/script has actually run successfully and the produced output has been checked.
   - Do not create placeholder scripts or hard-code guessed outputs to "fill in later". The first written result/script must actually parse the provided inputs, perform the requested geometry/lookup steps, and derive outputs from those computations.
   - Do not write a result file, JSON payload, or script containing fixed numeric deliverables before computation. Placeholder constants for mass, volume, material ID, or similar outputs are forbidden unless the task explicitly provides them as inputs.
   - If a helper already returns values like main-component volume, component selection, or material ID, use those results directly after sanity-checking them against the task requirements.
   - Preferred execution order for scan-derived mass tasks: discover helper/tool -> read the external reference table early -> isolate largest geometric component -> read volume/material ID from that component -> retrieve the exact density row for that ID -> compute mass only if units are explicitly supported.
   - Preferred successful pattern for multi-step tasks: inspect any provided analysis utility first, run it to get authoritative intermediate values (for example `main_part_volume` and `main_part_material_id`), then run one small reproducible script that performs exact lookup, arithmetic, required file output, and a read-back verification end-to-end.
   - Keep the workflow staged and auditable: (1) extract geometry facts from the selected component, including any material/attribute ID, then (2) resolve that ID through the provided reference table, then (3) compute derived properties. Do not blend lookup assumptions into the geometry-extraction step.
   - Treat the extracted material ID (or task-defined attribute key) as the primary join key into any external reference table; do not switch keys unless the task explicitly defines a different mapping.
   - Keep the end-to-end script auditable: print or retain the selected component measurement, parsed material ID, matched lookup row/value, unit status, and arithmetic used to produce the final file/report.
   - If using a helper such as a mesh analyzer, still verify that it preserved the task-relevant attribute/Material ID and that its "largest component" logic is geometric connectivity, not metadata grouping.
   - When running provided helpers or your own script, try the working interpreter directly; if `python` is unavailable, retry with `python3` before changing approach.
   - Prefer standard-library Python for STL parsing, connectivity, volume math, arithmetic, and file/JSON output. Do not introduce `numpy` or other third-party dependencies for basic mesh tasks unless the environment already has them or the task explicitly requires them.
   - If you believe a non-standard library is necessary, check/import-test it early before building the workflow around it; otherwise use a dependency-free implementation.
   - In particular, do not start with `numpy` for triangle math or connectivity on basic STL jobs; use pure-Python cross/dot helpers unless you have already confirmed `numpy` is available in this environment.
   - If a genuinely needed dependency is unavailable via import and direct `pip` install is blocked by the environment, check whether the task environment permits installing the equivalent system package before abandoning the working approach.
   - Use that fallback only when it unblocks a task-required/helper-required dependency; do not install packages when a helper tool or standard-library implementation already covers STL parsing, connectivity, volume, lookup, and file output.
2. Parse the STL file (binary format) only if needed
   - Keep the successful split between model extraction and external lookup: first extract volume/component/material ID from the mesh or helper output, then resolve that exact ID against the reference table in a separate step.
   - Keep extraction staged: first obtain geometric measurements and raw identifiers from the mesh, then perform any external table lookup and final arithmetic as a separate step.
   - Preserve task-defined meanings of STL attribute bytes; if the prompt says they encode Material ID or similar metadata, extract and carry that field through to the lookup step.
   - For binary STL, explicitly read the 2-byte attribute field from each 50-byte triangle record when the task indicates it carries metadata; do not let a default parser silently drop it.
   - If metadata is triangle-level (for example, Material ID in attribute bytes), summarize or preserve it before/while isolating components so the selected main component can still be tied back to the correct ID(s).
3. Identify connected components
   - Prefer a mesh-analysis library/tool that can split the mesh into connected components and return the largest component directly; fall back to manual triangle/vertex adjacency only if no suitable tool is available.
   - DO NOT implement components as `material_id -> triangles` or pick the main part as the material with the largest summed volume; disconnected regions sharing one material must remain separate components.
   - Minimum acceptable pattern: build triangle/vertex adjacency from shared geometry, run connected-components traversal, measure each geometric component, then select the requested largest component.
   - Proven successful pattern for noisy scans: isolate the main part by geometric connectivity first, then extract material/attribute data from that selected component.
   - For scanned meshes with debris, perform component isolation before extracting volume or attribute-driven physical properties.
   - Build components from mesh connectivity (shared vertices/edges between triangles), not from material IDs, colors, or other metadata labels.
   - If asked for the main part, select the largest geometric connected component after connectivity analysis.

4. Extract geometric properties (volume) and attributes
   - If any required lookup file/table output is truncated or does not visibly include the needed material ID/key, do a targeted re-read/search for that exact entry before using it.
   - Hard stop for derived values: if the needed material ID/key is not explicitly visible from a direct read/search/parse of the source file in the current run, do **not** compute or report mass yet.

   - Example stop condition: if the selected component shows `Material ID 42` but the current evidence only shows density-table rows for other IDs, stop and re-read/search the table for `42` instead of writing any mass.
   - Acceptable evidence is the exact matched row/key and value visible in tool output, parsed file content, or script printout; unacceptable evidence is assuming the key exists because nearby IDs were visible or because the result seems plausible.
   - If final quantities depend on an external reference file (for example, a material-density table), read/parse that reference early so the extracted material ID can be resolved immediately against the exact source row.
   - Keep geometry extraction and derived-value calculation as two explicit phases: (1) obtain the selected component's verified measurements/attributes, then (2) perform lookup and arithmetic from those verified outputs.
   - Do not skip directly from "found an STL" to a final mass claim without a visible intermediate geometry/material result you can inspect.
   - After isolating the requested geometric component, determine its material/attribute value from the triangles in that component rather than from whole-file assumptions.
   - When a helper/tool can return both component geometry and preserved material/attribute metadata in the same run, prefer that combined extraction over separate passes.
   - Before lookup or mass arithmetic, print/log the selected component's observed material/attribute value(s) so the exact component-to-lookup link is visible in the run evidence.
   - If attribute values differ within the selected component, report the inconsistency and do not assume a single material ID unless the task provides a rule for resolving it.
   - If mesh units are not explicitly stated in the STL/task/supporting docs, keep geometric results in file units and treat mass as unverified rather than choosing a conversion.
5. Compute derived values (mass = volume × density)
   - Keep the dependency order explicit for multi-step tasks: `largest connected component -> geometric measurement(s) + material ID from that component -> exact reference-table row for that ID -> derived calculation`.
   - Before writing any derived physical quantity, explicitly compute and record the chain in order: component-selection result, extracted material ID, exact retrieved lookup row/value, unit evidence (or lack of it), conversion used, and final arithmetic.
6. Before mass calculation, verify two prerequisites: (a) the exact material-ID-to-density row was explicitly retrieved, and (b) any unit conversion is supported by explicit evidence.

   - If a table preview/search is truncated or only shows other IDs, that does **not** satisfy prerequisite (a); run a targeted read/search/parse for the exact extracted ID before computing mass.
7. If either prerequisite is missing, stop short of a definitive mass claim and state what remains unverified.
   - Do not "repair" a missing prerequisite by rewriting the method around a new unit assumption. If units remain unproven, withdraw any definitive mass and report the ambiguity instead of switching to mm/cm or another convention without evidence.
   - Do not write a definitive mass/result file field that depends on those missing prerequisites; leave the physical quantity unverified instead of choosing a conventional unit or guessed lookup value.
8. Verify the full chain before final output: selected component -> material ID -> density lookup -> unit assumptions/conversion -> final arithmetic.
   - Make the verification visible: ensure the current run shows or prints the component measurement, extracted material ID, exact matched lookup row/value, and arithmetic used for the final number before saving or reporting it.
   - Verification must cover the computation itself, not just artifact creation: ensure the observed logs/script output contain enough data to recompute the reported result from volume, matched density, and any conversion.
   - Minimum evidence before a definitive mass: visible volume for the selected component, visible material ID from that component, visible matched density row/value for that exact ID, and visible arithmetic connecting them to the reported mass.
   - Verification must cover the computation itself, not just artifact creation: ensure the observed logs/script output contain enough data to recompute the reported result from volume, matched density, and any conversion.
   - If the current script/tool output does not show the matched density row or the arithmetic leading to mass, rerun or extend it before finalizing.
9. If the task requires writing a result file or structured payload, validate the exact final artifact after writing: re-open/read it, confirm required fields and numeric values match your intended result, and fix any malformed serialization before finishing.
   - If you rewrite or replace the analysis script late in the workflow, re-open/inspect the rewritten code and re-run the key diagnostics or comparison checks before trusting its output.
   - Do not replace a previously validated analysis script with a shortened "final" version and assume the logic is unchanged; confirm that component selection, attribute extraction, lookup, unit handling, and arithmetic still match the verified method.
   - Write exactly the requested path and schema only; do not rename the file, omit required keys, or add extra keys/prose beyond the contract.
   - Before writing any artifact that includes mass or other unit-dependent physical quantities, confirm unit evidence is explicit in the task/files/docs. If units are still ambiguous and multiple conversions remain plausible, do not write a definitive physical value; write only the verified geometry in file units plus an explicit `unverified`/`ambiguous units` status if the schema allows, or stop and report the blocker.
   - Preserve automation-friendly outputs: write only the exact requested schema/keys, with no extra diagnostic fields unless the task explicitly asks for them.
   - Once the needed values are verified, write the requested artifact directly at the required path/schema rather than delaying output generation; then read it back to confirm the serialized contents match the computed result.
   - Minimum acceptable deliverable check: after writing the artifact, read back the exact path you wrote and confirm the required keys/fields and computed values are present in the serialized output, not just in your script variables or terminal narration.
   - Preserve computed numeric precision in machine-readable outputs unless the task explicitly specifies rounding or formatting; do not silently round derived values before writing the final artifact.
   - When the artifact reports a derived value from a lookup (for example mass from material density), include the lookup key/identifier used for that derivation alongside the computed value whenever the requested schema allows it (for example `material_id` next to `main_part_mass`).
   - Prefer outputs that preserve both the selected-component measurement inputs and the final derived value when the schema has room; this makes the result auditable without re-running the full analysis.
   - Strong default for file-delivery tasks: do not split the final write and validation across unrelated ad hoc commands when one script can write the artifact and immediately read it back for schema/value confirmation.
10. If tooling or your own script produces multiple candidate results under different unit assumptions, do not pick one by convention; resolve the ambiguity from explicit evidence or report that no definitive physical quantity can be concluded.
   - If a script/tool prints branches such as `assuming mm` and `assuming cm`, treat that as a hard stop for definitive mass output: do not write either branch into the final artifact until separate evidence proves the model units.
   - Do not perform "verification" steps that cannot answer the unit question (for example file size, formatting changes, or script cleanup) and then keep a previously chosen mass.
11. If a verification step for units, format, or lookup fails, switch to another evidence-based check using accessible files/tools before finalizing.
12. DO NOT treat a failed verification command as evidence for any assumption. Wrong: unit-check command fails -> assume mm and convert anyway. Right: try another observable source of evidence, or keep mass/output marked unverified if the assumption remains unresolved.
   - Do not rewrite a validated calculation around a new unit assumption just to force a definitive mass. If the prior method depended on an unproven unit, keep the result unverified until explicit unit evidence is found.
   - If you revise the script or method after discovering missing unit evidence, compare the new run against the prior chain and confirm the only changes are evidence-supported fixes, not a speculative unit switch.
   - If two plausible unit assumptions produce materially different masses, treat the task as unresolved until one branch is supported by explicit evidence from the prompt, files, docs, metadata, or tool output.
   - Treat outputs labeled `assuming mm`, `assuming cm`, etc. as unresolved branches, not candidate answers. Do not write any one branch into the final artifact unless the unit evidence is established separately from that output.
   - If the required file/schema expects a mass but units remain ambiguous, do not invent a best guess; write only an explicitly unverified/ambiguous status if the schema allows, otherwise stop and report the blocker.
11. Follow any task-specific execution/output protocol literally. If the task or system message requires a specific tool-call format, schema, file path, or exact completion token, use that exact format and end exactly as required; do not substitute your usual tool syntax or a free-form closing message.


12. Final-turn hard stop: immediately before responding, verify all three items together: (a) the final answer does not commit to any unresolved assumption branch, especially unit-dependent mass, (b) any late-rewritten script/file has been re-opened or its decisive diagnostics re-run, and (c) the final response is exactly the task-required completion token/format with no extra prose when required.
   - If outputs differ under `assuming mm` / `assuming cm` or similar branches, do not choose one by convention; keep mass/output unverified until explicit evidence resolves the branch.
   - If you rewrote the analysis script after validating an earlier version, inspect the rewritten file and rerun the key checks before trusting its final output.
   - Once deliverables are verified, emit the exact required completion token/string immediately, with no extra summary text when the protocol requires exact termination.

## Important Notes

- Prefer early lightweight inspection over late discovery: check the STL header, triangle count, and sample attribute bytes before expensive processing so you know whether the task is geometry-only or requires metadata-preserving analysis.
- STL attribute bytes may store metadata (material ID, color)
- Volume units depend on STL coordinate system - verify before computing

- Do not assume STL units by convention alone. If units are not stated in metadata, task text, or accompanying documentation, report geometric results in file units (for example, volume in file-units^3) rather than silently converting.
- If density is given in a fixed unit system (for example `g/cm^3`), only convert mesh volume when the mesh length unit is supported by explicit evidence.
- If multiple unit interpretations remain plausible and would produce materially different masses, do not choose one arbitrarily; keep investigating or report the ambiguity.
- If unit ambiguity remains unresolved, do **not** write a definitive mass to the final artifact/output file. Either continue investigating until the length unit is evidenced, or report volume in file units and explicitly mark mass as unverified.
- Do **not** justify a unit choice with bounding-box size, plausibility, scanning conventions, or "typical STL units" alone; those are not sufficient evidence for conversion to density-table units.
- Filter out noise/debris by keeping largest connected component

- Do not treat material ID groups as connected components unless the task explicitly defines components that way.
- When a task provides an external material-density table or lookup file, treat that file as the source of truth: read/parse it directly, verify the exact material ID entry, and do not hard-code or infer mappings from partial previews.
- Reinforce the proven order for property calculations: parse geometry/component first, retrieve the exact reference-table row for the observed ID second, and only then perform arithmetic.
- If a lookup table or sidecar-file read is truncated or partial, re-read or search for the exact material ID/key before using the value.
- Do not use a density value unless the exact material ID row/key was explicitly retrieved from the source file in the current task context.
- DO NOT reconstruct or hard-code a material-density mapping from a partial preview, prior run, or hand-copied subset. Read the referenced source file directly, search/parse until the exact material ID entry is found, and keep the used row traceable in the final result.
- If you cannot retrieve that exact entry, report the lookup as unverified rather than guessing.
- Wrong: using a density for ID 42 when the visible table output only showed rows through ID 25.
- Right: re-read/search the file for `42`, then cite the exact retrieved row/value before computing mass.
- Wrong: claiming a density for material ID `42` when the visible log never showed row `42` from the source file.
- Before any derived calculation, make sure the exact lookup row/key is observable in the current run's evidence (tool output, parsed file content, or script printout), not merely asserted in narration.

- Treat write success as insufficient by itself when producing deliverables: verify the contents of the written file/payload, not just the tool's success message.

- Prefer parsing the provided lookup file directly in code over manually transcribing a density dictionary from terminal output, especially when the file is long or initially viewed only partially.
- Do not treat a plausible final number as sufficient. Before saving a derived numeric deliverable, ensure the log or script output shows the exact lookup row, the unit status, and the arithmetic that reproduces the written value.
- Once required geometry/attribute values have been extracted from the provided files or trusted helper output, stop exploratory digging unless a new check can produce explicit task-relevant evidence. Do not let inconclusive searches (file size, conventions, web info, internal skill code, plausibility arguments) change the numeric result.

- Binary STL parsing (2-byte attribute at end of each triangle)
- For binary STL tasks where the prompt assigns meaning to the 2-byte attribute field, parse and preserve it explicitly through component selection and later lookup steps instead of discarding it as unused.
- Connected component analysis for noise filtering
- Reliable implementation pattern: build triangle connectivity from shared vertices/edges, run connected-components traversal, keep the largest geometric component, then compute its measurements.
- Volume calculation from mesh geometry
- For closed meshes, compute volume by summing signed tetrahedral contributions from triangle vertices; use the absolute value only after summing the signed total.

- For debris filtering: construct triangle/vertex adjacency, compute connected components, then keep the component with the greatest geometric extent (typically volume or triangle count as requested)
- For triangle-based volume, use simple helper functions for cross/dot products and signed-volume accumulation in pure Python instead of `numpy`.
- Do not add or install external packages for basic STL parsing, connectivity, or volume math unless the task explicitly requires them and the environment already guarantees them.
- Prefer a short end-to-end scripted workflow for multi-step tasks: first try an existing helper/tool for mesh analysis, then isolate the largest component if needed -> extract attribute/material ID -> read exact density entry -> compute outputs -> write required result file in the exact requested schema -> read it back to verify.
- Keep that workflow reproducible and auditable: emit or retain the intermediate values used for the final result (selected component measurement, extracted material ID, matched lookup row/value, unit status, arithmetic) so the written artifact can be checked against the computation.
- If an existing mesh-analysis tool can supply largest-component measurements and preserved STL attribute metadata in one run, prefer that single-tool flow over mixing custom parsers and manual geometry code.
- Use manual STL parsing mainly when the task specifically requires byte-level extraction or when a mesh tool cannot expose the needed geometry/attributes.## Common Patterns

- Binary STL parsing (2-byte attribute at end of each triangle)
- Connected component analysis for noise filtering
- Volume calculation from mesh geometry


- For debris filtering: construct triangle/vertex adjacency, compute connected components, then keep the component with the greatest geometric extent (typically volume or triangle count as requested)
- For triangle-based volume, use simple helper functions for cross/dot products and signed-volume accumulation in pure Python instead of `numpy`.
- Do not add or install external packages for basic STL parsing, connectivity, or volume math unless the task explicitly requires them and the environment already guarantees them.
- Prefer a short end-to-end script for multi-step tasks: load mesh -> isolate largest component if needed -> extract attribute/material ID -> read exact density entry -> compute outputs -> write required result file.
- Use manual STL parsing mainly when the task specifically requires byte-level extraction or when a mesh tool cannot expose the needed geometry/attributes.

- Check coordinate system units before multiplying volume × density
- Material lookup tables may be needed for density values; when they are, read the table early and resolve the exact parsed material ID against the source row before computing derived quantities.
- Test with sample file before processing full dataset


- Treat mass calculations as conditional: `mass = volume × density` only after units and density are both validated from provided inputs.
- For material tables, cite or extract the exact row used; do not infer unseen entries from partial output.
- Prefer source-driven lookup code over manual dictionaries when a task provides a density table file. Parse the provided table file and select the row matching the mesh's material ID instead of embedding `{id: density}` values by hand.
- Preserve task-defined STL attribute bytes through the workflow; if they encode Material ID or similar metadata, extract them from the mesh/component you actually measured and carry that exact value into lookup/output.
- A small bounding box or plausible size is not enough to prove units are mm vs cm; verify from metadata, documentation, or other explicit evidence.
- In final results, make numeric inputs traceable: state the material ID, confirmed density source/value, and whether unit evidence was established.
- Before writing any mass output, record a compact calculation trace: largest-component selection result, parsed material ID, exact density-table entry, unit status (`confirmed unit` or `file units only`), and the arithmetic used.
- If any link in that chain is missing, do not emit a definitive mass; report volume and the missing verification instead.

- Prefer a single reproducible scripted workflow for multi-step tasks (mesh analysis -> lookup -> calculation -> file output) so results are easy to verify.
- If a tool can directly return largest-component measurements and preserved STL attribute metadata, prefer that over reimplementing mesh connectivity from scratch.
- When helper scripts or domain utilities are present, inspect their expected inputs/outputs first so your workflow matches the task's intended mesh parsing and component-analysis path.
- When running helper scripts, try the provided interpreter directly; if `python` is unavailable, retry with `python3` before changing approach.## Tips

- When the unresolved question is model units, verify units with direct evidence only: task text, sidecar docs, metadata, helper output, or other explicit source material.
- Do not treat indirect checks such as file size, bounding-box plausibility, precision tweaks, script reformatting, or other unrelated metadata as resolving unit ambiguity.
- Wrong: script prints `assuming mm` and `assuming cm`, then you save one mass anyway after checking `ls -lh`.
- Right: either find explicit unit evidence that selects one branch, or keep mass unverified and say why.


- Standard-library-first is the default successful pattern for ad hoc analysis scripts in constrained environments. Only rely on `numpy` or other third-party packages after an explicit availability check succeeds.
- After computing the final verified value, write the requested artifact immediately rather than delaying serialization until after extra exploratory steps.
- Keep mixed tasks staged: first extract raw mesh facts (selected component, volume, material/attribute), then read the external reference row, then compute the requested business/domain value. This preserves auditability and matches the most reliable successful workflow.

## Verification Checklist

- Confirm any requested connected-component step was implemented from geometric adjacency, not metadata grouping or label aggregation.
- If a lookup file was long or truncated, confirm the exact material-ID row/key was re-read or searched and is visible in the evidence used.
- Before giving a final mass, verify that both the exact unit evidence and the exact density-table row are present in the observed inputs. If either is missing, stop short of a definitive mass.
- Confirm any lookup table values came from a direct read/search of the referenced source file, not a manually reconstructed subset or hard-coded dictionary.
- If multiple unit interpretations produce different physical answers, do not finalize one without explicit evidence resolving the units.
- If reporting mass, explicitly state the evidence for mesh length units; otherwise report only file-unit geometry and note that mass remains unverified.
- Verify the final numeric result is reproducible from logged intermediate values, not just stated in the output artifact.
- Confirm the solution does not depend on avoidable third-party packages for basic geometry or parsing.
- Check whether the task provides a helper script or existing tool that should be used instead of custom parsing.
- If the task requires a file output or JSON report, write exactly the requested path and schema; do not add extra keys or prose.
- If you wrote an output file, read it back and confirm the serialization is well-formed and the values/keys exactly match the intended final answer.

- Before the first tool call, confirm whether the task/environment mandates a specific action/tool syntax; if so, use that exact schema and tool naming for every interaction.
- Confirm every shell/action command is concrete and executable in the stated environment, not a placeholder or intention.
- Before the final turn, confirm the response is the exact required completion token/string with no extra prose when the protocol demands exact termination.
- If you used a plan/todo tracker, confirm no step is marked complete before the corresponding command succeeded and its output was verified.
- If reporting mass, confirm the exact material ID observed in the selected component appears in the reference evidence for this run; a truncated preview showing other IDs is not enough.
- If a unit-validation or format-validation command failed, confirm you either used an alternative evidence path or explicitly left the dependent physical quantity unverified.
- If any script/tool emitted multiple assumption-dependent results, verify that the final artifact does not commit to one unless separate explicit evidence resolved the assumption.
- Make each verification step answer the actual open question; for unit uncertainty, check unit evidence directly rather than unrelated file metadata or plausibility.
- Confirm the final numeric result can be recomputed from visible intermediate values in the log/script output, not merely from the contents of the written file.
- Reject any final mass that depends on a unit conversion introduced only from plausibility, bounding-box size, convention, or after an unsuccessful check.
- Confirm no deliverable values were hard-coded or prefilled before computation; every reported result must be traceable to parsed inputs, lookup data, and shown arithmetic.
- Confirm any custom script avoided unnecessary third-party dependencies, or that required dependencies were availability-checked before use.
- If you rewrote the final analysis script, inspect the rewritten file or reproduce the decisive diagnostics to confirm it preserved the validated logic before using its output.

- Before computation starts, confirm both the mesh/input file and every required lookup/reference file are present and readable.
- For binary STL, confirm the structure was validated first (header, triangle count, and expected file size) before trusting deeper parsing results.
- Before each tool/action call, confirm it matches the task-required interface exactly, including any mandated `Action:` JSON shape and supported tool name.
- Reject placeholder or descriptive commands; every command sent must be executable in the current environment.
- For mixed geometry + lookup tasks, confirm the workflow stayed staged: extraction first, lookup second, then arithmetic/output.
- Confirm there is an inspectable intermediate result from the geometry phase (for example, largest-component volume and material ID) before doing lookup/arithmetic.
- Confirm the material ID used for lookup is the exact ID extracted from the selected component and serves as the join key into the reference table.
- Confirm the selected component's material/attribute ID is visibly shown in the run output before matching it to the reference row; do not rely on narration about what the component 'should' contain.
- If a helper/tool was available and used, confirm you captured its key structured outputs explicitly before doing downstream arithmetic or file writing.
- Before finalizing a derived value, confirm the exact lookup row for the observed material ID/key is visible in this run's evidence.
- If unit evidence is still missing, confirm the final artifact/answer does not commit to a single mass produced by assuming mm/cm or another convention.
- Cross-check the reread artifact against the computation trace: confirm the saved numeric result matches the printed/intermediate volume, material ID, exact lookup row/value, and arithmetic from the same run.
- If the task does not specify rounding, confirm the written machine-readable numeric values preserve the computed precision rather than a shortened or display-rounded version.
- If the output includes a derived quantity from a reference lookup, confirm the artifact also preserves the exact lookup key used (such as `material_id`) whenever the schema permits it.
- Prefer an end-to-end verification loop for file-producing tasks: run the script/tool, reopen the written artifact, and compare the saved fields against the intermediate values printed or logged during computation.
- Before ending, confirm the final response is exactly the required completion token/string, with no extra prose when the protocol requires exact termination.

## Verification Checklist

- Confirm the material/attribute value came from the parsed mesh, not an assumption.
- Confirm the density or other reference value was explicitly read for that exact ID/key.
- Show or compute the arithmetic used for derived outputs, including any unit conversion.
- If the task specifies a required output schema, follow it exactly.
