**STOP — DO NOT READ THIS FILE. You are already reading it. This prompt was injected into your context by Claude Code's plugin system. Using the Read tool on this SKILL.md file wastes ~7,600 tokens. Begin executing Step 1 immediately.**

## Step 0 — Immediate Output

**Before ANY tool calls**, display this banner:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  PLAN-BUILD-RUN ► MILESTONE                                  ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Then proceed to Step 1.

# /pbr:milestone — Milestone Management

You are running the **milestone** skill. Milestones represent significant project checkpoints — a set of phases that together deliver a cohesive chunk of functionality. This skill handles the full milestone lifecycle: creation, completion, auditing, and gap analysis.

This skill runs **inline** for most subcommands, but spawns agents for `audit`.

## References

- `references/questioning.md` — Questioning patterns for milestone review decisions
- `references/ui-brand.md` — Status symbols, banners, milestone celebration format

---

## Context Budget

Reference: `skills/shared/context-budget.md` for the universal orchestrator rules.
Reference: `skills/shared/agent-type-resolution.md` for agent type fallback when spawning Task() subagents.

Additionally for this skill:
- **Never** perform integration checks yourself — delegate to the integration-checker subagent
- **Minimize** reading audit and verification outputs — read only frontmatter and status fields
- **Delegate** all cross-phase integration analysis to the integration-checker subagent

---

## Multi-Session Sync

Before any phase-modifying operations (archiving phases, updating ROADMAP.md/STATE.md/PROJECT.md), acquire a claim:

```
acquireClaim(planningDir, sessionId)
```

If the claim fails (another session owns this project), display: "Another session owns this project. Use `/pbr:progress` to see active claims."

On completion or error (including all exit paths), release the claim:

```
releaseClaim(planningDir, sessionId)
```

## Core Principle

**Milestones are the rhythm of the project.** They force you to step back, verify everything works together, and create a clean snapshot before moving on. Never skip the audit — integration issues hide at milestone boundaries.

---

## Argument Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for the subcommand and optional version:

```
$ARGUMENTS format: {subcommand} [{version/name}]

Examples:
  "new"              → subcommand=new, arg=none
  "new User Auth"    → subcommand=new, arg="User Auth"
  "complete v1.0"    → subcommand=complete, arg="v1.0"
  "complete 1.0"     → subcommand=complete, arg="v1.0" (auto-prefix v)
  "preview v1.0"     → subcommand=preview, arg="v1.0"
  "audit v1.0"       → subcommand=audit, arg="v1.0"
  "audit"            → subcommand=audit, arg=current milestone
  "gaps"             → subcommand=gaps, arg=most recent audit
```

**If no subcommand recognized:** Show usage:
```
Usage: /pbr:milestone <subcommand> [version]

Subcommands:
  new [name]       — Start a new milestone cycle
  complete [ver]   — Archive completed milestone
  preview [ver]    — Dry-run of complete (show what would happen)
  audit [ver]      — Verify milestone completion
  gaps             — Create phases to close audit gaps
```

**CRITICAL — After parsing the subcommand, run init command before any manual state reads:**

```bash
node plugins/pbr/scripts/pbr-tools.js init milestone
```

Store the JSON result as `blob`. This single call replaces multiple file reads across all subcommands:
- `blob.state.current_phase`, `blob.state.status` — current phase and status from STATE.md
- `blob.state.last_milestone_version`, `blob.state.last_milestone_completed` — milestone history
- `blob.has_roadmap` — whether ROADMAP.md exists
- `blob.has_project` — whether PROJECT.md exists
- `blob.milestones` — array of milestone sections parsed from ROADMAP.md (each with `name` and `phases_range`)
- `blob.existing_archives` — array of existing archive directory names
- `blob.phase_count` — total phase count
- `blob.config.mode`, `blob.config.planning`, `blob.config.git` — config settings

If `blob.error` is set, display the error banner and stop (no project found).

---

## Subcommand: `new`

Start a new milestone cycle with new phases.

### Flow

1. **Read current state from init blob:**
   - `blob.milestones` for existing milestone sections from ROADMAP.md
   - `blob.state.current_phase` and `blob.state.status` for current position
   - `blob.has_project` to check if PROJECT.md exists (read it for milestone history if needed)
   - `blob.phase_count` for total phase count

2. **Get milestone details** via AskUserQuestion:
   - "What's the name/goal for this new milestone?"
   - "What are the major features or capabilities it should deliver?"
   - If the user provided a name in `$ARGUMENTS`, use it and skip the name question

3. **Determine phase numbering:**
   - Find the highest phase number in the current ROADMAP.md
   - New phases start at highest + 1
   - Example: if phases 1-5 exist, new milestone starts at phase 6

4. **Mini roadmap session:**
   Run a condensed version of the `/pbr:new-project` questioning flow:

   a. Ask about major components needed (via AskUserQuestion):
      - "What are the 2-5 major areas of work for this milestone?"

   b. For each area, ask:
      - "Any specific requirements or constraints for {area}?"

   c. Generate phases from the areas:
      - Each major area becomes a phase
      - Order by dependency (foundations first)
      - Include brief description and success criteria

5. **Update ROADMAP.md:**
   Append new milestone section:

   ```markdown
   ---

   ## Milestone: {name}

   **Goal:** {goal statement}
   **Phases:** {start_num} - {end_num}

   ### Phase {N}: {name}
   **Goal:** {goal}
   **Requirements:** {REQ-IDs mapped to this phase}
   **Success Criteria:** {verifiable conditions for phase completion}
   **Depends on:** {prior phases}

   ### Phase {N+1}: {name}
   ...
   ```

6. **Create phase directories:**
   For each new phase:
   ```
   .planning/phases/{NN}-{slug}/
   ```

7. **Update PROJECT.md** (create if needed):
   Add milestone to the active milestones list:

   ```markdown
   ## Active Milestones

   ### {name}
   - **Phases:** {start} - {end}
   - **Created:** {date}
   - **Status:** In progress
   ```

**CRITICAL (no hook) -- DO NOT SKIP: Update STATE.md frontmatter AND body with new milestone info.**

8. **Update STATE.md:**
   - Set current phase to the first new phase
   - Update milestone info

**CRITICAL (no hook) -- DO NOT SKIP: Generate root MILESTONE.md file.**

8b. **Generate root MILESTONE.md:**
   Read the current milestone section from ROADMAP.md (the `## Milestone:` section just created in Step 5) and STATE.md for current phase and status. Write `MILESTONE.md` at the project root with:

   ```markdown
   # Current Milestone: {name}
   **Version:** {version} | **Status:** In Progress | **Created:** {date}

   **Goal:** {goal}

   ## Phases
   | Phase | Goal | Status |
   |-------|------|--------|
   | {N}. {name} | {goal} | Pending |
   ...

   ---
   *Auto-generated by `/pbr:milestone new`. Updated by `/pbr:autonomous`.*
   ```

   - Read the phase list from the ROADMAP.md section just written in Step 5
   - Status column: "Pending" for all new phases

**Milestone branch creation (when git.branching is 'milestone'):**
When starting a new milestone and `git.branching` is `milestone`:
- Create branch: `git switch -c pbr/milestone-v{version}`
- All phase work happens on this branch
- Branch is merged when `/pbr:milestone complete` is run

9. **Commit** if `planning.commit_docs: true`:
   ```
   docs(planning): start milestone "{name}" (phases {start}-{end})
   ```

10. **Confirm** with branded output — read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/new-output.md.tmpl` and fill in `{name}` (milestone name), `{count}` (phase count), `{N}` (first phase number).

---

## Subcommand: `preview`

Dry-run of milestone completion — shows what would happen without making any changes.

### Flow

1. **Determine version:**
   - Same logic as `complete`: use `$ARGUMENTS` or ask via AskUserQuestion

2. **Identify milestone phases:**
   - Read ROADMAP.md to find phases belonging to this milestone
   - List each phase with its current status (from STATE.md or VERIFICATION.md)

3. **Verification status check:**
   - For each milestone phase, check if VERIFICATION.md exists and its `result` frontmatter
   - Flag phases that are unverified or have stale verification (SUMMARY.md newer than VERIFICATION.md)

4. **Preview archive structure:**
   - Show what the archive directory would look like:
     ```
     .planning/milestones/v{version}/
     ├── ROADMAP.md (snapshot)
     ├── STATS.md (would be generated)
     ├── REQUIREMENTS.md (snapshot)
     └── phases/
         ├── {NN}-{slug}/ (moved from .planning/phases/)
         │   ├── PLAN-01.md
         │   ├── SUMMARY.md
         │   └── VERIFICATION.md
         └── ...
     ```

5. **Show what would change:**
   - Which phase directories would be moved
   - What ROADMAP.md section would be collapsed
   - What STATE.md updates would occur
   - What git tag would be created

6. **Display summary:**
   ```
   ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
   ║  PLAN-BUILD-RUN ► MILESTONE PREVIEW — v{version}             ║
   ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

   Phases to archive: {count}
   ✓ Verified: {verified_count}
   ⚠ Unverified: {unverified_count}
   ⚠ Stale verification: {stale_count}

   Archive location: .planning/milestones/v{version}/
   Git tag: v{version}

   Ready to complete? Run: /pbr:complete-milestone v{version}
   ```

**CRITICAL (no hook)**: This subcommand is READ-ONLY. Do not create directories, move files, modify STATE.md, modify ROADMAP.md, or create git tags. Only read and display.

---

## Subcommand: `complete`

Archive a completed milestone and prepare for the next one.

### Flow

1. **Determine version:**
   - If provided in `$ARGUMENTS`: use it (auto-prefix `v` if missing)
   - If not provided: ask via AskUserQuestion: "What version number for this milestone? (e.g., v1.0)"

2. **Check verification debt across ALL phases:**
   - Use `blob.milestones` to find the target milestone's phase range
   - For each phase in the range, check VERIFICATION.md status:
     - `gaps_found` or `human_needed` or `partial` → verification debt exists
   - If verification debt found, display warning:
     ```
     Verification Debt:
       - Phase {N}: {status} ({count} outstanding items)
     ```
   - This is non-blocking but prominently displayed before the completion decision

3. **Verify all phases are complete:**
   - For each phase in the range, check for VERIFICATION.md
   - If any phase lacks VERIFICATION.md:

     Present the warning context:
       Unverified phases:
       - Phase {N}: {name}
       - Phase {M}: {name}

     **CRITICAL -- DO NOT SKIP**: Present the following choice to the user via AskUserQuestion before proceeding:
     Use AskUserQuestion (pattern: yes-no from `skills/shared/gate-prompts.md`):
       question: "{count} phases haven't been verified. Continue with milestone completion?"
       header: "Unverified"
       options:
         - label: "Continue anyway"  description: "Proceed despite unverified phases (not recommended)"
         - label: "Stop and review"  description: "Run /pbr:verify-work for unverified phases first"
     - If "Stop and review" or "Other": stop and suggest the review commands for each unverified phase
     - If "Continue anyway": proceed with warning noted

   **Timestamp freshness check:**
   For each phase that has a VERIFICATION.md, compare its `checked_at` frontmatter timestamp against the most recent SUMMARY.md file modification date in that phase directory (use `ls -t` or file stats).
   If any SUMMARY.md is newer than its VERIFICATION.md `checked_at`:
   - Warn: "Phase {N} ({name}) was modified after verification. The VERIFICATION.md may not reflect the current code state."
   - List affected phases with their freshness details

   **CRITICAL -- DO NOT SKIP**: Present the following choice to the user via AskUserQuestion before proceeding:
   Use AskUserQuestion (pattern: stale-continue from `skills/shared/gate-prompts.md`):
     question: "{count} phases were modified after verification. Re-verify or continue?"
     header: "Stale"
     options:
       - label: "Re-verify"        description: "Run /pbr:verify-work for affected phases (recommended)"
       - label: "Continue anyway"   description: "Proceed with potentially outdated verification"
   - If "Re-verify" or "Other": suggest the review commands for affected phases and stop
   - If "Continue anyway": proceed with warning noted

3. **Gather milestone stats:**

   ```bash
   # Get commit range for this milestone's phases
   git log --oneline --since="{milestone start date}" --until="now"

   # Count files changed
   git diff --stat {first_milestone_commit}..HEAD
   ```

   Collect:
   - Total commits in milestone
   - Total files changed
   - Lines added / removed
   - Duration (start date to now)
   - Number of phases completed
   - Number of plans executed
   - Number of quick tasks

4. **Extract accomplishments:**
   Read all SUMMARY.md files for milestone phases:
   - Collect `provides` fields (what was built)
   - Collect `key_decisions` fields
   - Collect `patterns` fields
   - Collect `tech_stack` union

**Milestone branching (config-gated):**
Read `blob.config.git.branching` (or fall back to reading config if blob unavailable).
- If `milestone`:
  a. Check if milestone branch exists: `git branch --list pbr/milestone-v{version}`
  b. If branch exists:
    - Use AskUserQuestion:
      question: "Milestone v{version} complete. Merge branch `pbr/milestone-v{version}` to main?"
      header: "Merge milestone branch?"
      options:
        - label: "Yes, merge"   description: "Merge milestone branch to main and delete it"
        - label: "No, keep"     description: "Keep the branch for manual review"
    - If "Yes, merge":
      1. `git switch main`
      2. `git merge --no-ff pbr/milestone-v{version}` (no-ff to preserve milestone history)
      3. `git branch -d pbr/milestone-v{version}`
      4. Log: "Milestone branch merged and deleted"
    - If "No, keep": leave branch as-is
  c. If branch does not exist: no action (phases were on main or individual phase branches)
- If `none`, `phase`, or `disabled`: no milestone branch operations

5. **Archive milestone documents:**

   **CRITICAL (no hook): Pre-flight safety checks BEFORE archiving. Do NOT skip this step.**

   Before creating or moving anything, verify the destination is safe:
   - Check `blob.existing_archives` to see if the version directory already exists
   - If it exists AND contains files (phases/, STATS.md, etc.), STOP and display:
     ```
     ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
     ║  ERROR                                                       ║
     ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

     Archive destination `.planning/milestones/{version}/` already contains files.
     Completing this milestone would overwrite the existing archive.

     **To fix:** Run `/pbr:health` or manually inspect `.planning/milestones/{version}/`.
     Use a different version number (e.g., {version}.1) or remove the existing archive first.
     ```
     Ask the user via AskUserQuestion whether to use a different version or abort.
   - Verify each source phase directory exists before attempting to move it
   - If any source phase directory is missing, warn but continue with the phases that do exist

   **CRITICAL (no hook): Back up ROADMAP.md BEFORE any destructive operations. Do NOT skip this step.**

   Use the compound init-milestone command to atomically create the archive directory, copy ROADMAP.md, copy REQUIREMENTS.md (if present), and update STATE.md:

   ```bash
   pbr-tools compound init-milestone {version} --name "{milestone_name}" --phases "{start}-{end}"
   ```

   This MUST happen before any of the following: moving phase directories, collapsing ROADMAP.md sections, or further STATE.md updates.

   The compound command creates the archive directory and copies ROADMAP.md + REQUIREMENTS.md. Now move phase directories and create STATS.md:
   - `.planning/milestones/{version}/STATS.md` — milestone statistics
   - `.planning/milestones/{version}/phases/{NN}-{slug}/` — move each milestone phase directory from `.planning/phases/` into the archive

   **CRITICAL (no hook): Move phase directories from .planning/phases/ to archive NOW. Do NOT skip this step.**

   **Move phases:** For each phase belonging to this milestone, move (not copy) its directory from `.planning/phases/{NN}-{slug}/` to `.planning/milestones/{version}/phases/{NN}-{slug}/`. This keeps the active phases directory clean for the next milestone.

   **CRITICAL (no hook): Write STATS.md to .planning/milestones/{version}/STATS.md NOW. Do NOT skip this step.**

   **Stats file content:**

   Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/stats-file.md.tmpl` for the stats file format. Fill in all `{variable}` placeholders with actual data gathered in Steps 3-4.

5b. **Archive stale research data:**

   After archiving phase directories, prune stale research/intel/codebase data that predates the milestone:

   ```bash
   pbr-tools data prune --before {milestone_start_date}
   ```

   Where `{milestone_start_date}` is the earliest phase start date from the milestone (derived from the first SUMMARY.md `start_time` or the milestone creation date).

   - Log the count of archived files (e.g., "Archived 12 stale research files")
   - If no files to archive, log "No stale research files to archive"
   - Note: SUMMARY.md, STACK.md, and FEATURES.md are preserved (never pruned) since they are canonical references for active work

6. **Update PROJECT.md:**
   - Move milestone from "Active" to "Completed"
   - Add completion date and version tag

   ```markdown
   ## Completed Milestones

   ### {name} ({version})
   - **Completed:** {date}
   - **Phases:** {start} - {end}
   - **Key deliverables:** {summary}
   ```

   - Move validated requirements from active to completed section

**CRITICAL (no hook): Run PROJECT.md evolution review NOW. Do NOT skip this step.**

6b. **PROJECT.md Evolution Review:**
   After moving the milestone to completed status, review and evolve the project definition:

   1. **Move completed Active Requirements to Validated** — Any requirement from the completed milestone that was satisfied (per VERIFICATION.md) should move from Active to Validated section
   2. **Review Out of Scope** — Check if any previously out-of-scope items are now unblocked by the completed milestone's deliverables. If so, note them for the user's consideration (do not move them automatically)
   3. **Annotate Key Decisions with outcomes** — For each Key Decision in PROJECT.md that relates to the completed milestone, add an Outcome column value: `Good` (decision worked well), `Revisit` (decision caused issues), or `Pending` (outcome not yet clear)
   4. **Update Constraints** — Remove or update any constraints that changed during the milestone (e.g., a technology constraint that was relaxed)
   5. **Refresh Core Value** — If the project direction shifted meaningfully during the milestone, suggest an updated Core Value statement to the user via AskUserQuestion

**CRITICAL (no hook): Update ROADMAP.md with collapsed milestone section NOW. Do NOT skip this step.**

7. **Collapse completed phases in ROADMAP.md:**
   Replace detailed phase entries with a `<details>` collapsed summary (backward compat: also recognized by `-- COMPLETED` text):

   ```markdown
   <details>
   <summary>## Milestone: {name} ({version}) — SHIPPED {date}</summary>

   | Phase | Status |
   |-------|--------|
   | {N}. {name} | Completed |
   | {N+1}. {name} | Completed |

   Completed: {date} | Archive: `.planning/milestones/{version}/`

   </details>
   ```

7a. **Update milestone index:**
   After collapsing the milestone, update or create a `## Milestones` index section near the top of ROADMAP.md (after the title, before the first active milestone). Each entry is one line:

   ```markdown
   ## Milestones

   | Version | Name | Status | Date |
   |---------|------|--------|------|
   | {version} | {name} | SHIPPED | {date} |
   ```

   If the section already exists, append a row. If it does not exist, create it.

**CRITICAL (no hook): Update STATE.md to mark milestone as complete NOW. Do NOT skip this step.**

7b. **Update STATE.md:**
   - Update `.planning/STATE.md` frontmatter to reset to idle state:
     - `current_phase: null`
     - `phase_slug: null`
     - `phase_name: null`
     - `phases_total: 0`
     - `status: "idle"`
     - `progress_percent: 0`
     - `plans_total: 0`
     - `plans_complete: 0`
     - `last_activity: "{date} Milestone {version} complete"`
   - Update the body section to reflect idle state (no active phase)

7c. **Record milestone completion in STATE.md frontmatter:**
   - Update STATE.md frontmatter with milestone completion data:
     - Set `last_milestone_version: "{version}"`
     - Set `last_milestone_completed: "{ISO datetime}"`
   - **Do NOT write to a ## History section in STATE.md** — History has been removed from STATE.md to keep it lean. Milestone completion records are preserved in the archive's STATS.md and ROADMAP.md snapshot.
   - If a ## History section exists in STATE.md (from a prior version), remove it during milestone completion to enforce the new format.

**Run state reconcile after archival** to reset phases_total and current_phase to reflect the next milestone's phases:

```bash
pbr-tools state reconcile
```

This command re-derives phase counts from ROADMAP.md and reports any phantom phase rows (progress table rows with no corresponding directory on disk). Review and remove phantom rows manually if no longer needed.

**CRITICAL (no hook): Reconcile ROADMAP phase statuses NOW. Do NOT skip this step.**

7c2. **ROADMAP Reconciliation:**
   After state reconcile, run a full reconciliation pass to fix any stale phase statuses across the entire ROADMAP:

```bash
pbr-tools roadmap reconcile
```

   - Log the output (number of entries fixed)
   - This catches phase status mismatches that accumulated during the milestone lifecycle
   - Covers both the just-completed milestone and any prior stale entries

7d. **Aggregate learnings into KNOWLEDGE.md from milestone phases:**

**CRITICAL (no hook): Run learnings aggregation NOW. Do NOT skip this step.**

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/milestone-learnings.js .planning/milestones/{version} --project {project-name-from-STATE.md}
```

This script aggregates SUMMARY.md patterns, decisions, and deferred items into the project-scoped `.planning/KNOWLEDGE.md` (table format with K/P/L-prefixed IDs). It also writes to the global `~/.claude/learnings.jsonl` for cross-project use.

- If the script outputs an error, log it but do NOT abort milestone completion — learnings aggregation is advisory.
- Display the aggregation summary line to the user (e.g., "KNOWLEDGE.md: 5 new entries, 2 duplicates skipped").
- After aggregation, check for triggered deferral thresholds:

```bash
pbr-tools learnings check-thresholds
```

If any thresholds are triggered, display each as a notification:

```
Note: Learnings threshold met — {key}: {trigger}. Consider implementing the deferred feature.
```

7e. **Run calibration for all evaluative agents on expanded corpus:**

```bash
pbr-tools calibrate all
```

This re-analyzes corpus data for all evaluative agents (verifier, audit, integration-checker, plan-checker) and updates `.planning/intel/{agent}-calibration.md` with gap patterns and recommendations. The calibration data informs each agent's few-shot examples.

- If the command fails, log it but do NOT abort — calibration is advisory.
- Display per-agent corpus size and pass rate summary to the user.
- If any agent has recommendations, note: "Calibration updated for {agents}. Review few-shot examples to apply findings."

8. **Git tag:**
   ```bash
   git tag -a {version} -m "Milestone: {name}"
   ```

9. **Generate RETROSPECTIVE.md:**

   The CLI (`pbr-tools.js milestone complete`) auto-generates a RETROSPECTIVE.md entry. Verify it exists at `.planning/RETROSPECTIVE.md`. If the CLI was not used (manual completion), create the entry using `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/RETROSPECTIVE.md.tmpl` as the format reference. Fill in `{version}`, `{name}`, `{date}`, and the "What Was Built" section from MILESTONES.md accomplishments. Leave other sections as placeholders for the user to fill.

9aa. **Insights integration:**

   Check for a recent /insights HTML report:

   ```bash
   find ~/.claude/insights/ -name "*.html" -mtime -7 2>/dev/null | head -1
   ```

   **If a recent report exists (modified within 7 days):**
   1. Read the HTML file and extract key workflow findings (friction patterns, efficiency suggestions, recurring issues)
   2. Append a "## Workflow Insights" section to `.planning/RETROSPECTIVE.md` with 3-5 bullet points summarizing the most relevant insights for this milestone's work
   3. Add the RETROSPECTIVE.md to the git staging area

   **If no recent report exists:**
   Display this suggestion after the RETROSPECTIVE.md is generated:

   ```
   Tip: Run /insights to capture workflow patterns from this milestone's sessions.
        Insights feed into future audits and help the planner avoid repeated friction.
   ```

9a. **Commit:**
   ```bash
   git add .planning/milestones/ .planning/phases/ .planning/ROADMAP.md .planning/PROJECT.md .planning/STATE.md .planning/RETROSPECTIVE.md
   git commit -m "docs(planning): complete milestone {version}"
   ```

**CRITICAL (no hook): Generate changelog entry NOW. Do NOT skip this step.**

9b. **Generate changelog entry:**

   Generate a user-facing changelog entry for this milestone. Read all SUMMARY.md files from the milestone phases (now in `.planning/milestones/{version}/phases/`) and categorize deliverables into Keep a Changelog sections:

   - **Added** — New features, commands, capabilities (from SUMMARY.md `provides` fields)
   - **Changed** — Modifications to existing behavior, UI updates, performance improvements
   - **Fixed** — Bug fixes, error corrections (from commits with `fix:` type)

   Format each entry with a **bolded feature name** followed by an em-dash and description:
   ```markdown
   ### Added
   - **Feature name** — What it does and why it matters
   - **Another feature** — Description focusing on user impact
   ```

   Rules for good entries:
   - Lead with the user-visible impact, not the implementation detail
   - Group related commits into a single entry (e.g., 5 commits for "auth" become one "Authentication system" entry)
   - Use bold feature names, not commit scopes
   - No commit hashes — this is prose, not a git log
   - No internal scopes (phase-plan numbers, TDD markers)
   - End with install line: `Install/upgrade: \`npx @sienklogic/plan-build-run@latest\``

   Draft the full entry and present it to the user for review:

   Use AskUserQuestion:
   ```
   question: "Here's the draft changelog for {version}. Want to edit it before writing?"
   header: "Changelog"
   options:
     - label: "Looks good"        description: "Write this to CHANGELOG.md as-is"
     - label: "Edit"              description: "I'll provide corrections"
     - label: "Skip changelog"    description: "Don't update the changelog for this release"
   ```

   - If "Looks good": write the entry to CHANGELOG.md (insert after the header, before any existing version entries)
   - If "Edit" or "Other": apply the user's corrections, then present again for final confirmation
   - If "Skip changelog": proceed without changelog update

   If writing to CHANGELOG.md:
   ```bash
   git add CHANGELOG.md
   git commit -m "docs: update changelog for {version}"
   ```

9c. **Push milestone to remote:**

Use AskUserQuestion to ask the user how they want to publish the milestone:

```
question: "How should this milestone be published to GitHub?"
header: "Publish"
options:
  - label: "Push tag + commits"    description: "Push the v{version} tag and any unpushed commits to origin"
  - label: "Skip for now"          description: "Keep everything local — push later manually"
```

- If "Push tag + commits": run `git push origin main --follow-tags` to push both commits and the annotated tag in one command. Display success or error.
- If "Skip for now": display reminder: "Tag v{version} is local only. Push when ready: `git push origin main --follow-tags`"
- If "Other": follow user instructions (e.g., create a PR, push to a different branch, etc.)

9d. **Automatic npm release:**

After pushing, automatically run the npm release to publish this milestone:

```bash
npm run release -- --minor
```

Display the output to the user. The `--minor` flag is used because milestone completions always represent new features.

- If the release succeeds: display the new version number and GitHub Release URL
- If the release fails: show the error as an advisory warning — the milestone is already archived. Suggest the user run `npm run release` manually after fixing the issue.

### Post-Completion Smoke Test

If `config.deployment.smoke_test_command` is set and non-empty:

1. Run the command via Bash
2. If exit code 0: display "Smoke test passed" with command output
3. If exit code non-zero: display advisory warning:

   ```
   ⚠ Smoke test failed (exit code {N})
   Command: {smoke_test_command}
   Output: {first 20 lines of output}
   ```

   This is advisory only — the milestone is already archived. Surface it as a potential issue for the user to investigate.

10. **Confirm** with branded output — read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/complete-output.md.tmpl` and fill in `{version}`, `{count}` (phases, plans, commits), `{lines}`, `{duration}`.

**NEXT UP block after milestone complete:**

After displaying the branded complete-output banner, always display a NEXT UP routing block:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  ▶ NEXT UP                                                   ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

**Start the next milestone** — continue development with new phases

`/pbr:milestone new`

**Also available:**
- `/pbr:release` — tag and publish this milestone as a GitHub Release
- `/pbr:status` — review project state before continuing

<sub>`/clear` first → fresh context window</sub>
```

This ensures the milestone complete subcommand never ends in a routing dead end.

## Subcommand: `audit`

Verify milestone completion with cross-phase integration checks.

### Flow

1. **Determine target:**
   - If version provided: audit that specific milestone
   - If no version: audit the current milestone (use `blob.milestones` to identify the most recent active milestone)

2. **Read all VERIFICATION.md files** for milestone phases (use `blob.milestones` to identify the phase range):
   - Collect verification results
   - Note any `gaps_found` statuses
   - Note any phases without verification

3. **Spawn integration checker:**

   Display to the user: `◆ Spawning integration checker...`

   Spawn `Task(subagent_type: "pbr:integration-checker")`. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/integration-checker-prompt.md.tmpl`, fill in `{version or "current"}`, `{list of phase directories}`, and `{phase SUMMARY.md paths}`, then use the filled template as the Task() prompt.

4. **Check integration-checker completion:**

   After the integration-checker completes, check for `## INTEGRATION CHECK COMPLETE` in the Task() output. If the marker is absent, warn: `⚠ Integration checker did not return completion marker — results may be incomplete.` Proceed with whatever findings were returned but note the incomplete status in the audit report.

5. **Check requirements coverage:**
   - Read REQUIREMENTS.md
   - For each requirement tagged for this milestone:
     - Search VERIFICATION.md files for coverage
     - Search SUMMARY.md `provides` fields
     - Flag uncovered requirements

6. **Write audit report:**

   Create `.planning/{version}-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` using the structured template:

   Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/MILESTONE-AUDIT.md.tmpl` for the audit report format with YAML frontmatter scores. Fill in all `{variable}` placeholders with actual data from the audit. The YAML frontmatter MUST include `scores` (requirements, phases, integration, flows), `gaps` array, and `tech_debt` array.

   **Spot-check:** After writing, verify `.planning/{version}-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` exists on disk using Glob. If missing, re-attempt the write. If still missing, display an error and include findings inline.

7. **Report to user** using branded banners — read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/audit-output.md.tmpl`. The template contains all 3 variants (PASSED, GAPS FOUND, TECH DEBT). Select the appropriate section based on audit result. Fill in `{version}`, `{count}`, `{gap 1}`, `{gap 2}` as applicable.

---

## Subcommand: `gaps`

Create phases to close gaps found during an audit.

### Flow

1. **Find most recent audit:**
   - Search for `*-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` in `.planning/`
   - If multiple, use the most recent
   - If none: "No audit found. Run `/pbr:audit-milestone` first."

2. **Read audit report:**
   - Extract all gaps and tech debt items
   - Parse severity levels

3. **Prioritize gaps:**

   Group by priority:
   - **Must fix** (critical/high): Blocking issues, broken integration, uncovered requirements
   - **Should fix** (medium): Non-critical integration issues, important tech debt
   - **Nice to fix** (low): Minor tech debt, optimization opportunities

4. **Present to user:**

   ```
   Gaps from milestone audit:

   Must fix ({count}):
   - {gap}: {description}

   Should fix ({count}):
   - {gap}: {description}

   Nice to fix ({count}):
   - {gap}: {description}

   **CRITICAL -- DO NOT SKIP**: Present the following choice to the user via AskUserQuestion before proceeding:
   Use AskUserQuestion (pattern: multi-option-priority from `skills/shared/gate-prompts.md`):
     question: "Which gaps should we address? ({must_count} must-fix, {should_count} should-fix, {nice_count} nice-to-fix)"
     header: "Priority"
     options:
       - label: "Must-fix only"    description: "Address {must_count} critical/high gaps"
       - label: "Must + should"    description: "Address {must_count + should_count} critical through medium gaps"
       - label: "Everything"       description: "Address all {total_count} gaps including low priority"
       - label: "Let me pick"      description: "Choose specific gaps to address"
   - If "Must-fix only": filter to must-fix gaps for phase creation
   - If "Must + should": filter to must-fix + should-fix gaps
   - If "Everything": include all gaps
   - If "Let me pick" or "Other": present individual gaps for selection

5. **Group into logical phases:**
   - Group related gaps together (same subsystem, same files)
   - Each group becomes a phase
   - Name phases descriptively: "{N+1}. Fix {area} integration" or "{N+1}. Address {component} gaps"

6. **Update ROADMAP.md:**
   Add gap-closure phases after the current milestone phases:

   ```markdown
   ### Phase {N}: Fix {area} (gap closure)
   **Goal:** Address gaps found in milestone audit
   **Gaps addressed:**
   - {gap 1}
   - {gap 2}
   **Success criteria:** All addressed gaps pass verification
   ```

7. **Create phase directories:**
   ```
   .planning/phases/{NN}-fix-{slug}/
   ```

8. **Commit:**
   ```
   docs(planning): add gap-closure phases from milestone audit
   ```

9. **Confirm** with branded output — read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/gaps-output.md.tmpl` and fill in `{count}` (gap-closure phases created), `{N}` (first gap phase number), `{name}` (phase name).

## State Integration

All subcommands use `blob.state` and `blob.config` from the init call for reading state. All subcommands update STATE.md on write:
- `new`: Sets current milestone, resets phase
- `complete`: Clears current milestone, updates history
- `audit`: Notes audit status and date
- `gaps`: Updates phase count and roadmap info

---

## Git Integration

Reference: `skills/shared/commit-planning-docs.md` for the standard commit pattern.

All subcommands commit if `blob.config.planning.commit_docs` is true:
- `new`: `docs(planning): start milestone "{name}" (phases {start}-{end})`
- `complete`: `docs(planning): complete milestone {version}`
- `audit`: `docs(planning): audit milestone {version} - {status}`
- `gaps`: `docs(planning): add gap-closure phases from milestone audit`

Tags (complete only):
- `git tag -a {version} -m "Milestone: {name}"`

---

Reference: `skills/shared/error-reporting.md` for branded error output patterns.

## Edge Cases

For all edge case handling, see `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/templates/edge-cases.md`.
Key scenarios: no ROADMAP.md, no phases, no gaps found, version collision, partially verified, large milestone (8+ phases).

---

## Anti-Patterns

1. **DO NOT** skip the audit before completing — integration issues hide at boundaries
2. **DO NOT** auto-complete milestones without user confirmation
3. **DO NOT** create gap phases without user approval of priorities
4. **DO NOT** delete audit reports — they're historical records
5. **DO NOT** reuse version numbers — each milestone gets a unique version
6. **DO NOT** modify code during milestone operations — this is project management only
7. **DO NOT** collapse phases in ROADMAP.md before archiving — archive first, collapse second
8. **DO NOT** skip the git tag — tags make milestone boundaries findable
