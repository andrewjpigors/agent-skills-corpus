  Manage inventory, logistics, shipments, and sales resources via the Alliance
  Business Suite (ABS) REST API. Covers warehouses, ports, vessels, voyages,
  waybills (air/road/rail/sea), trucks, proofs of delivery, packing/pick/restock
  documents, shipments, bills of lading, shipping methods/couriers/zones/classes,
  stores, point-of-sales, loyalty programs and sales literature — including atomic
  PATCH (JSON Patch) updates. All operations are tenant-scoped and require a bearer
  token (see the absuite-login skill to authenticate).

# Alliance Business Suite — Misc Services (Inventory / Logistics / Shipments / Sales / Marketplace) REST Skill

This skill teaches an agent to drive five ABS services purely over REST:
**InventoryService**, **LogisticsService**, **ShipmentsService**, **SalesService**, and
**MarketplaceService**. Logistics and Shipments are large transport/document services
(waybills, proofs of delivery, bills of lading, voyages, trucks). Sales is a small POS
catalog (stores, POS terminals, loyalty programs, literature). Inventory exposes a single
read endpoint. Marketplace currently exposes no tenant-domain REST endpoints.

> For the CLI equivalent see `absuite-misc-cli`; for general REST conventions see `absuite-rest`.

## Authentication

Obtain a bearer token, then send it on every request:

```bash
# 1) Log in
curl -X POST "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "'$ABSUITE_USER_EMAIL'", "password": "'$ABSUITE_USER_PASSWORD'"}'
# -> extract accessToken from the JSON response

# 2) Send it on every call
-H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

- **Base path:** `$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/<ServiceName>/<Resource>`.
- **Response envelope:** every response is
  `{ "isSuccess": bool, "errorMessage": str|null, "correlationId": str, "timestamp": str, "result": <data|array|int|null> }`.
  Always check `isSuccess`, then read the payload from `result`.

## Tenant scoping

Read the per-endpoint rule from the manifest, do not assume:

- **Logistics, Shipments, Sales** domain endpoints all require **`?tenantId=<tenant-guid>`**
  on **every** verb — including POST / PUT / PATCH / DELETE and the `/Count`, `/Extended`,
  and action sub-paths. Omitting it on writes returns `400`. The equivalent header is
  `X-TenantId: <tenant-guid>` (the platform binds the query param OR the header
  interchangeably); examples below use the query param.
- **InventoryService `Inventory/{stockItemId}/Details`** takes **no** `tenantId` param
  (path-scoped by the stock item) — do not add one.
- Optional everywhere: `api-version` (query) and `x-api-version` (header). Omit unless told otherwise.

## PATCH = JSON Patch (RFC 6902)

`PATCH` request bodies are a JSON **array** of operations with `Content-Type: application/json`:

```json
[
  { "op": "replace", "path": "/title", "value": "New title" },
  { "op": "add",     "path": "/remarks", "value": "Handle with care" }
]
```

`op` ∈ `add|remove|replace|move|copy|test`; `path`/`from` are JSON-Pointers (leading `/`,
camelCase field names). PATCH is for atomic partial updates — change a couple of fields
without resending the whole object (safer than PUT under concurrent edits). PATCH is
available on Logistics and Shipments aggregates and their line/entry sub-resources, and on
all four Sales aggregates. See each section for which paths support it.

Field names in `-d '{...}'` create/update bodies use **camelCase** exactly as transcribed
from the manifest below (e.g. `documentNumber`, `freightCurrencyId`, `shipperContactId`).
A handful of ShipmentsService policy fields use trailing uppercase `ID` (`currencyID`,
`countryID`, `shippingCourierID`) — transcribe those verbatim.

---

# Inventory

The **InventoryService** exposes a single read endpoint: inventory details for a stock item.
There is no list/create/update/delete and no PATCH.

```bash
# Get inventory details for a stock item (no tenantId param — path-scoped)
curl -X GET "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/InventoryService/Inventory/<stockItemId>/Details" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

---

# Logistics

The **LogisticsService** manages supply-chain documents and assets: warehouses, ports,
vessels, voyages (with port calls), trucks (with trips), truck drivers, proofs of delivery
(with lines and attached delivery notes), delivery notes, supplier profiles, item restocks /
retain samples / packing slips / pick lists (each with entries), and four waybill families
(air / rail / road / sea, each with lines). Every aggregate supports list / count / get /
create / **PUT** / **PATCH** / delete; transport documents add lifecycle actions.

**All Logistics endpoints require `?tenantId=<tenant-guid>` on every verb.**

## Warehouses

```bash
# List
curl -X GET "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/LogisticsService/Warehouses?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN"

# Count
curl -X GET "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/LogisticsService/Warehouses/Count?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN"

# Get by ID
curl -X GET "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/LogisticsService/Warehouses/<warehouseId>?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN"

# Create (title + address1 required)
curl -X POST "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/LogisticsService/Warehouses?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "title": "Central DC",
        "address1": "100 Dock Rd",
        "address2": "",
        "postalCode": "00000",
        "phone": "",
        "countryId": "<country-guid>",
        "stateId": "<state-guid>",
        "cityId": "<city-guid>",
        "isGroup": false,
        "parentWarehouseId": null
      }'

# Update (PUT — full replace)
curl -X PUT "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/LogisticsService/Warehouses/<warehouseId>?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "title": "Central DC (renamed)", "address1": "100 Dock Rd" }'

# Patch (atomic partial update)
curl -X PATCH "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/LogisticsService/Warehouses/<warehouseId>?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[ { "op": "replace", "path": "/phone", "value": "+1-555-0100" } ]'

# Delete
curl -X DELETE "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/LogisticsService/Warehouses/<warehouseId>?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

`WarehouseCreateDto` fields: `title`(req), `address1`(req), `address2`, `address3`,
`postalCode`, `phone`, `countryId`, `stateId`, `cityId`, `isGroup`, `shipwireWarehouseId`,
`parentWarehouseId` (plus optional `id`, `timestamp`). `WarehouseUpdateDto` drops `id`/`timestamp`.

## Ports

```bash
# Create (title + address1 required)
curl -X POST "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/LogisticsService/Ports?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "title": "Port of Example",
        "address1": "Pier 1",
        "unLocode": "XXXXX",
        "iataCode": "",
        "portType": "Seaport",
        "portAuthority": "",
        "hasCustomsFacility": true,
        "isFreeTradezone": false,

        "longitude": 0.0,
        "latitude": 0.0,
        "countryId": "<country-guid>"
      }'
```

Other ops follow the standard pattern (`tenantId` required on all):
`GET /Ports`, `GET /Ports/Count`, `GET /Ports/<portId>`,
`PUT /Ports/<portId>`, `PATCH /Ports/<portId>`, `DELETE /Ports/<portId>`.
`PortCreateDto` adds: `company`, `email`, `address2`, `address3`, `unit`, `customCity`,

## Waybills (Airway / Rail / Road / Seaway) + Lines

Four parallel transport-document families. Each has CRUD + count + PATCH, a **Lines**
sub-resource (CRUD + count + PATCH), and lifecycle actions. The Lines DTO is shared across
all four (`WaybillLineCreateDto`/`WaybillLineUpdateDto`).

| Family | Base path | Path id param | Lifecycle actions |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Airway Bills | `/AirwayBills` | `{billId}` | Issue, Cancel, MarkInTransit, MarkArrived, MarkDelivered |
| Rail Waybills | `/RailWaybills` | `{waybillId}` | Issue, Cancel, MarkInTransit, MarkDelivered |
| Road Waybills | `/RoadWaybills` | `{waybillId}` | Issue, Cancel, Dispute, MarkInTransit, MarkDelivered |
| Seaway Bills | `/SeawayBills` | `{billId}` | Issue, Cancel, MarkInTransit, MarkArrived, Release |

# Shipments

The **ShipmentsService** manages shipments, shipping labels, bills of lading (with lines),
shipping methods, couriers, regions, zones, classes, and item shipping policies. Every
aggregate supports list / count / get / create / PUT / **PATCH** / delete. Only Bills of
Lading have a sub-resource (Lines). **No lifecycle actions in this service.**

**All Shipments endpoints require `?tenantId=<tenant-guid>` on every verb.**

## Shipments

## Shipping Methods / Couriers / Regions / Zones / Classes

Five flat catalogs, each CRUD + count + PATCH. Representative create bodies:

```bash
# Shipping Method (shippingClassCalculationType is an enum)
curl -X POST "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/ShipmentsService/ShippingMethods?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "name": "Standard Ground", "description": "", "cost": 9.99, "taxable": true,
        "taxIncluded": false, "currencyId": "<currency-guid>",
        "shippingClassCalculationType": "PerOrder" }'

# Shipping Courier
curl -X POST "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/ShipmentsService/ShippingCouriers?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "name": "Fragile", "slug": "fragile" }'
```

- `ShippingZoneCreateDto`: `name`**req**, `default`, `everywhere`, `postalCodes`, `countryCodes`.
- `ShippingClassCreateDto`: `name`**req**, `slug`.

## Item Shipping Policies

CRUD + count + PATCH. Several fields use trailing uppercase `ID` — transcribe verbatim.

```bash
curl -X POST "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/ShipmentsService/ItemShippingPolicies?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "title": "Free over $50", "type": "Threshold", "code": "FREE50",

        "value": 0, "percentage": 0, "currencyID": "<currency-guid>",
        "shippingCourierID": "<courier-guid>" }'
```

`ItemShippingPolicyCreateDto` required fields: `title`, `type`, `code`, `currencyID`,
`shippingCourierID`. Optional: `description`, `isExpressShipmentPolicy`, `isFree`, `reduce`,
`isEnabled`, `isDefault`, `allowInternational`, `hours`, `days`, `weeks`, `months`, `years`,
`value`, `percentage`, `countryID`, `countryStateID`, `customState`, `customCity`, `cityID`.

# Sales

The **SalesService** manages stores, point-of-sale terminals, loyalty programs, sales
literature, and exposes a read-only margin lookup. The four collection aggregates support
list / count / get / create / PUT / **PATCH** / delete. **No lifecycle actions.**

**All Sales collection endpoints require `?tenantId=<tenant-guid>` on every verb.** The
`Margins/<marginId>/Details` lookup takes **no** `tenantId` param.

## Stores

```bash
curl -X POST "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/SalesService/Stores?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "name": "Flagship Store", "eCommerce": true, "currencyId": "<currency-guid>" }'

curl -X PATCH "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/SalesService/Stores/<storeId>?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[ { "op": "replace", "path": "/eCommerce", "value": false } ]'
```

`StoreCreateDto`: `name`**req**, `eCommerce`, `currencyId`.

## Point of Sales

```bash
curl -X POST "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/SalesService/PointOfSales?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "title": "Register 1", "code": "POS-1", "description": "",
        "priceListId": "<pricelist-guid>", "locationId": "<location-guid>" }'
```

`PointOfSaleCreateDto`: `title`**req**, `code`, `description`, `priceListId`, `locationId`.

## Loyalty Programs

```bash
curl -X POST "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/SalesService/LoyaltyPrograms?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "title": "Gold Tier", "description": "", "priceListId": "<pricelist-guid>" }'
```

`LoyaltyProgramCreateDto`: `title`**req**, `description`, `priceListId`.

## Sales Literatures

CRUD + count + PATCH, plus a collection-level **Extended** read
(`GET /SalesLiteratures/Extended`, returns literatures with related data; tenantId required).
There is **no** per-id `/Extended` endpoint.

```bash
curl -X GET "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/SalesService/SalesLiteratures/Extended?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN"

curl -X POST "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/SalesService/SalesLiteratures?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "title": "Product Brochure", "content": "...", "description": "",
        "expirationDate": "2026-12-31", "salesLiteratureTypeId": "<type-guid>" }'
```

`SalesLiteratureCreateDto`: `title`, `content`, `description`, `modifiedDate`,
`expirationDate`, `salesLiteratureTypeId`.

## Margins (read-only)

```bash
# Get margin details (no tenantId param)
curl -X GET "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/SalesService/Margins/<marginId>/Details" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

# Marketplace

The **MarketplaceService** currently exposes **no tenant-domain REST endpoints** — its
OpenAPI surface contains only shared host endpoints (login/register/health and the AI
Completions helper), which are not part of this skill. There is nothing to create, list,
or update here yet; re-check the manifest when the service gains resources.

# End-to-end workflow (create → add lines → issue → patch)

A typical outbound-air shipment, using only verified endpoints (tenantId required throughout):

```bash
# 1) Create a shipment
curl -X POST "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/ShipmentsService/Shipments?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "trackingCode": "TRK-2001", "isInternational": true, "shippingTerms": "CIF",
        "orderId": "<order-guid>" }'   # -> result.id = <shipment-guid>

# 2) Create the airway bill for that shipment
curl -X POST "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/LogisticsService/AirwayBills?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "documentNumber": "AWB-2001", "shipperContactId": "<contact-guid>",
        "consigneeContactId": "<contact-guid>", "carrierId": "<courier-guid>",
        "shipmentId": "<shipment-guid>" }'   # -> result.id = <billId>

# 3) Add a line
curl -X POST "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/LogisticsService/AirwayBills/<billId>/Lines?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "description": "Electronics", "quantity": 12, "grossWeightKg": 240, "hsCode": "8471.30" }'

# 4) Issue, then mark in transit
curl -X POST "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/LogisticsService/AirwayBills/<billId>/Issue?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN"
curl -X POST "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/LogisticsService/AirwayBills/<billId>/MarkInTransit?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN"

# 5) Patch the shipment's status atomically when it ships
curl -X PATCH "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/ShipmentsService/Shipments/<shipment-guid>?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[ { "op": "replace", "path": "/shipped", "value": true } ]'
```

No tenant-domain REST endpoints currently exposed.

---

## Critical rules

- Always check `isSuccess` and read data from `result`.
- Send `?tenantId=<tenant-guid>` on **every** Logistics / Shipments / Sales call (incl. writes,
  `/Count`, `/Extended`, actions). Do **not** send it to `Inventory/.../Details` or
  `Margins/.../Details`.
- PATCH bodies are JSON-Patch arrays (`[{op,path,value}]`); PUT bodies are full DTO objects.
- Create/Update body keys are camelCase as transcribed — except ItemShippingPolicies, which
  use `currencyID`/`countryID`/`countryStateID`/`cityID`/`shippingCourierID` (uppercase `ID`).
- `shippingTerms` (Shipments) and `shippingClassCalculationType` (Shipping Methods) are enums —
  use only the listed values.
- For the CLI equivalent see `absuite-misc-cli`; for general REST conventions see `absuite-rest`.
