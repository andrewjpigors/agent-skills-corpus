# Start Day

Prepare today's Morning Brief with yesterday's context — devlogs, carry-forward tasks, calendar, and any available Evening Entry. This is Phase A of the daily loop: **the AI arrives prepared before the user starts work.**

## Key Principles

1. **Write to the Morning Brief page only** — the recap and full briefing go to the morning entry. Today's committed plan goes to the daily hub after `/process-morning` processes any optional human context.
2. **Recap window = days with captured work** — the gather script walks back through tiers (3 → 5 → 7 days) until it finds the most recent surfaceable content. The window covers `[from..today]`, with empty days between gaps rendered as a one-liner.
3. **Keep it scannable** — short bullets, not paragraphs. Group by project, not by file.
4. **Don't duplicate /process-morning** — this skill preps, it does not extract or create tasks.
5. **No silent failures** — track every source call, report what succeeded/failed/skipped. See `vault-config/references/source-manifest.md`.
6. **Task visibility via Bases queries** — the journal template's `## Tasks Overview` queries render tasks from `type: task` frontmatter. This skill does not write task lists.
7. **No task note creation** — `/process-morning` owns task note creation after the Morning Brief.
8. **Privacy is respected without prompting** — files in private projects (project hub has `private: true`) are silently excluded. The gather script also stamps `private: true` directly into excluded files' frontmatter as a one-way durable marker so future tools see the flag without re-traversing the project hub.

## Sources

Track all source calls per `vault-config/references/source-manifest.md`. The gather script tracks CLI sources automatically via `source_manifest`. MCP sources (Linear, QMD) are tracked by you in Step 2.

| Source | Used For | Criticality |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Obsidian CLI | Read/write Morning Brief, daily hub, devlogs | REQUIRED |
| Obsidian MCP | Patch sections into Morning Brief + hub | REQUIRED |
| QMD Search | Devlog lookup (backup to glob) | MEDIUM |
| Todoist CLI | Today's tasks, carry-forward, Linear sync | HIGH |
| GWS Calendar | Today's calendar events | MEDIUM |
| Linear MCP | Configured Linear issues → Todoist sync | MEDIUM |
| Task Notes | Task note frontmatter (all projects) | MEDIUM |
| Vault git | Scaffold snapshot commit (Step 5b) | MEDIUM |

## Invocation

```
/start-day              → prep today's Morning Brief
/start-day 2026-03-15   → prep a specific date
```

## Tool Rules
> Reference: vault-config/references/tool-selection.md
> CLI for reads, writes, graph traversal, and property operations.
> MCP only for semantic search and section-level patching.
> DO NOT use mcp__obsidian-mcp-tools__get_vault_file for reads.

## Step 1: Run the Gather Script

Collect all deterministic context data:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/start-day/scripts/gather_morning_context.sh [optional-date]
```

Parse the JSON output. It contains:
- `dates` — today, yesterday (calendar), day names
- `files` — journal/hub paths and existence flags
- `recap_window` — `{from, to, beyond_lookback, days_empty[], days[]}` where each day has `{date, day_name, devlogs[], notes[]}`. `from == to` means single-day window (the common case). `beyond_lookback: true` means the tiered probe (3/5/7 days) found no captured work — render the escape-hatch message instead of an empty recap.
- `commits` — `{available, commits[]}` where each commit has `{sha, date, subject, kind, files[], projects[], areas[]}`. Drives "What Moved Forward" and "What Changed Structurally".
- `active_projects` — `[{slug, area, hub_path}, ...]` — all `status: active` project hubs vault-wide.
- `hot` — `[{slug, area, hub_path, last_activity_date, days_silent, area_priority_rank, recency_source, plan_path, latest_in_project_age_days}, ...]` — projects with 0–3d recency. **Suppressed at render** — tracked for completeness only.
- `warm` — `[{slug, area, hub_path, last_activity_date, days_silent, area_priority_rank, recency_source, plan_path, latest_in_project_age_days}, ...]` — projects with 4–13d recency. Renders as a Warm sub-band under "Needs Attention".
- `cold` — same shape as `warm[]` plus a `reason` field — projects with ≥14d recency. Renders as a Cold sub-band under "Needs Attention".
- `todoist` — overdue + today tasks
- `workitems` — external work-item integration (inert stub — connect Linear via MCP)
- `evening` — last night's reflection content
- `meetings_today` — today's `type: meeting` notes found by local frontmatter reads, including `is_prep`, `start`, `end`, `tags`, `area`, and `project`
- `task_notes` — task-note frontmatter, including `path`, `status`, `priority`, `due_date`, `area`, `project`, `tags`, and `blocked_by`
- `areas` — ordered `[{slug, display, rank}, ...]` parsed from this vault's own `AGENTS.md` areas table (`| Area folder | \`area\` slug |`), in table row order. This is the single source of truth for area ordering and area-hub wikilink targets in the v3 cockpit render — never a hardcoded area list. An empty array means the table is missing/unparseable; the renderer degrades to a generic per-slug display and unranked (rank 99) ordering rather than crashing.
- `source_manifest` — what succeeded and what failed

If the script fails to execute, check that it has execute permission:
```bash
chmod +x ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/start-day/scripts/gather_morning_context.sh
```

## Step 2: Supplement with MCP Tools

The gather script can't call MCP tools. Fill in the gaps:

### Linear Issues (when configured)

```
mcp__linear__list_issues(assignee="me", state="In Progress")
```

Use the vault's `AGENTS.md` Cross-System Identity mapping to scope the workspace/team when one is configured. If no mapping exists, skip this source. Record failure and continue if unavailable.

### Backup Search (only if recap window is unexpectedly empty)

If `recap_window.days` is empty AND `recap_window.beyond_lookback` is false, that's a surprise — the script found something to anchor the window on but no surfaceable content. Use QMD as a backup:

```
mcp__qmd__search(query="YESTERDAY_DATE", collection="vault")
```

Surface anything in `*/Dev Log/` or `*/Notes/` paths. Otherwise skip this step — `beyond_lookback: true` is a real signal, not a failure.

### Task Notes (all projects)

Task note discovery is handled by `gather_morning_context.sh` — read `task_notes` from the gather output. Each entry has `path`, `status`, `priority`, `due_date`, `area`, `project`, `blocked_by`. No skill-side bash loop is needed.

## Step 3: Ensure Files Exist

Check `files.journal_exists` and `files.daily_hub_exists` from the gather output.

**If journal doesn't exist**, create it:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/start-day/scripts/ensure_journal.sh TARGET_DATE
```

**If daily hub doesn't exist**, create it:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/start-day/scripts/ensure_daily_hub.sh TARGET_DATE
```

**If `files.journal_has_context` is true**: This is a re-run. Replace the existing context sections.

## Step 4: Interpret and Write

### 4-v3: Daily Cockpit Render (authoritative)

Use the deterministic renderer for the current `/start-day` cockpit shape. The legacy `Recent Accomplishments` instructions below (4-legacy) are retained as historical reference only; do **not** render the old `Recent Accomplishments` / `Last Night's Reflection` block for current runs.

Render from the gather JSON:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/start-day/scripts/gather_morning_context.sh TARGET_DATE > "$TMPDIR/start-day-context.json"
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/start-day/scripts/render_start_day.py "$TMPDIR/start-day-context.json" > "$TMPDIR/start-day-cockpit.md"
```

The rendered cockpit block has this section contract:

```markdown
### Overall Read
### Movement From Yesterday +/- 1
---
### Control Queue
### Threads To Keep Visible
#### At Risk
```

Optional model synthesis is allowed only inside short prose sentences:
- `Recent trend`
- `Key insight for today`
- parent-bullet summaries in `Movement`

Do not change the section order, remove source warnings, invent meetings, or invent tasks. Meeting Prep must come from `meetings_today`; Review/Decide/Dispatch candidates must come from `task_notes`, `meetings_today`, or `source_manifest`. Area order and area-hub wikilinks come from `areas` (see Step 1) — never hardcode an area list or wikilink target.

Patch the rendered block into the Morning Brief by replacing the existing cockpit region from `### Overall Read` through `#### At Risk`. If an older entry still has the legacy `## Recent Accomplishments` scaffold, replace that legacy block with the v3 cockpit block.

`/start-day` still does **not** write the daily hub. `/process-morning` owns the daily hub after the morning entry exists.

### 4-legacy: Historical Render Notes (do not use for current v3 runs)

Read `references/context-format.md` for exact formatting rules.

`/start-day` writes **one atomic patch** into the Morning Brief — the entire legacy `## Recent Accomplishments` block (containing the three operational subsections + the `### Last Night's Reflection` subsection) is replaced in a single MCP call. All task visibility comes from the `## Tasks Overview` Bases queries the template already provides; this skill does not write task lists.

> **Why one atomic patch.** Earlier iterations made two patch calls (one for Recent Accomplishments, a separate one for Last Night's Reflection). On re-runs after the first section had reflowed text, the second patch sometimes failed to find its H3 target and appended a duplicate H1 at the bottom of the file. Folding Last Night's Reflection into the Recent Accomplishments payload eliminates that drift. See Start-Day Iteration Findings 5-15 §5.

### 4a: Recent Accomplishments — Atomic Render

Replace the placeholder in `## Recent Accomplishments` with a single payload containing the three operational subsections **and** the Last Night's Reflection H3.

**Tone**: Direct, factual, no celebration language. "You worked on X" not "Great work on X!". Match the chief-of-staff voice — concise, evidence-grounded, no padding.

**Always render the window header line first** (single-day or multi-day):

```
> **Recap Window**: M/D → M/D · N day(s) had no captured work (M/D, M/D)
```

If `recap_window.beyond_lookback == true`, render the escape-hatch and skip the three sections:

```
> No captured work in the last 7 days. Run `/start-day --since YYYY-MM-DD` to view earlier work.
```

Otherwise render three subsections in order. Omit any subsection that would be empty.

**Ordering rule — applies to all three subsections:**

Sort entries by `area_priority_rank` ascending (primary key), then by the per-subsection secondary key below. `area_priority_rank` is emitted by the gather script on every `active_projects[]`, `hot[]`, `warm[]`, and `cold[]` entry (1={workarea-slug}, 2=rs42, 3={sidearea-slug}, 4=personal, 5=personal-finance/finance, 6=health, 7=career, 99=unknown). For entries derived from commits or devlogs (which carry an `area` field, not a direct rank), resolve the rank via the same mapping or by looking up the project in `active_projects[]`.

Per-subsection secondary keys:
- **What Moved Forward**: within an area, area-level entries (bare `- **[[Area]]** *(area-level)*`) before project entries; project entries in any stable order (alpha or evidence-volume).
- **What Changed Structurally**: within an area, no specific secondary order (typically one bullet per area).
- **Needs Attention**: within each band, sort by `area_priority_rank` ascending; secondary sort is `days_silent` ascending in Warm (freshest first), `days_silent` descending in Cold (longest-silent first).

**Area priority outranks the secondary key.** Example: a 38-days-silent {SideArea} project sorts *below* a 34-days-silent {SideArea2} project, because {SideArea2} (rank 2) outranks {SideArea} (rank 3). Preserve the configured area rank before applying recency as the secondary key.

### What Moved Forward

Group `commits[]` (kind in `docs|feat|fix`) and `recap_window.days[].devlogs[]` by project. For each project with evidence, write a parent bullet with no inline body, then one tab-indented sub-bullet per distinct work item (commit cluster or devlog session):

```
- **[[Area]] / [[Project Hub]]**
	- Work item one — concise factual description derived from commit subjects + devlog session_topics + (optionally) note titles. No celebration words.
	- Work item two — …
```

Synthesis rules:
1. Drop the `docs:` / `feat:` / `fix:` prefix when reading commit subjects.
2. The parent bullet is bare — no dash-separated summary inline. All content goes in sub-bullets.
3. Each distinct commit cluster or devlog session becomes exactly one sub-bullet. Do not merge all sub-bullets into a single run-on sentence.
   - *A commit cluster is two or more commits from the same project that share a theme or touch the same subsystem — render them as one sub-bullet. Commits in the same project that address genuinely distinct pieces of work each get their own sub-bullet.*
4. Use the project hub wikilink as the anchor (the hub_path's filename without extension).
5. For area-level work (no project, e.g. notes in `6. Main Notes/` with only `area:` set), use a bare parent `- **[[Area]]** *(area-level)*` with sub-bullets underneath — same nested shape.

### What Changed Structurally

Filter `commits[]` to those where at least one file in `files[]` matches a structural-change pattern:

- `2. Projects/*/{Project}/{Project}.md` (project hub edits)
- `3. Areas/*/Goals/*.md` (goal hubs)
- `Personal/*/*.md` where filename equals folder name (personal project hubs)
- New project scaffolds: any commit where files include a previously-non-existent `{Project}/{Project}.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `system-settings/Templates/*` (vault config / templates)

Group by area. Write a bare parent bullet per area and structural changes as tab-indented sub-bullets underneath:

```
- **[[Area]]**
	- Structural change one — description.
	- Structural change two — description.
```

### Needs Attention

Render two H4 sub-bands. **Hot** (`hot[]`, 0–3d) is **not rendered** — projects that fresh don't need flagging; the band exists in the gather output for completeness and downstream tools.

**Subsection header:**

```
### Needs Attention
```

**Warm band — H4 (4–13 days):**

```
#### Warm — recently active, keep visible *(4–13 days)*
```

Each entry from `warm[]`, sorted by `area_priority_rank` ascending (primary), then `days_silent` ascending (freshest first within band):

When `recency_source == "in-project"`:
```
- **[[Area]] / [[Project Hub]]** — Nd since [[<last touched file or feature>]]. <Optional carry-forward context from prior journal>
```

When `recency_source == "plan"`:
```
- **[[Area]] / [[Project Hub]]** — Nd via [[<plan-name>]] (plan-driven activity; latest in-project file is Md old). <Optional carry-forward context>
```

The `<plan-name>` is the basename of `plan_path` without `.md` (e.g. `2026-05-14-vault-setup-kit-update-story`). The `Md old` value is `latest_in_project_age_days` from the entry — omit the parenthetical entirely if that field is null (no in-project file yet).

**Cold band — H4 (≥14 days):**

```
#### Cold — going stale, archive-sweep candidates *(14+ days)*
```

Each entry from `cold[]`, sorted by `area_priority_rank` ascending (primary), then `days_silent` descending (longest-silent first within band):

```
- **[[Area]] / [[Project Hub]]** — `status: active` but {reason}. Last touched {last_activity_date} ({days_silent} days ago). <Optional carry-forward context>
```

The `{reason}` comes from the gather output's `reason` field on cold entries (either "no devlog or knowledge note in this project folder" for never-touched, or "no devlog or knowledge note dated within 14 days" otherwise).

**When `recency_source == "none"`** (never-touched project; `last_activity_date == "never"`, `days_silent == 999`), omit the "Last touched … (… days ago)" tail entirely — the sentinels are not meaningful values. Render the bullet as:

```
- **[[Area]] / [[Project Hub]]** — `status: active` but {reason}. <Optional carry-forward context>
```

**Carry-forward context (optional, non-mechanical):**

For each entry rendered, check the prior Morning Brief (`5. Resources/Personal/Journal/Morning Entries/<yesterday>.md`)'s Needs Attention section. If the same `slug` appears there, copy any trailing prose annotation. This is best-effort prose carry; drop or update stale date-specific annotations. Without a prior-Brief source, omit them.

**Omission rule:**

If both `warm[]` and `cold[]` are empty, omit the entire `### Needs Attention` H3. If only one band has entries, omit the empty sub-band but keep the H3.
Hot-band population does not affect this rule — Hot is never rendered, so a non-empty `hot[]` with empty Warm/Cold still omits the H3.

**Wikilink resolution:**

All wikilinks in this section follow §4c rules (basename for areas, hub_path basename for projects, full-path form for basename collisions). Plan-file wikilinks use the plan's basename — plans live under `docs/superpowers/plans/` and basenames are date-prefixed and unique by convention; bare basename resolves.

### 4b: Last Night's Reflection (rendered inside the 4a payload)

Append the `### Last Night's Reflection` subsection as the **last** H3 inside the Recent Accomplishments payload. This is part of the same patch call as 4a — do not make a separate `patch_vault_file` call targeting `Last Night's Reflection`.

**Populated shape** (when `evening.found == true`):

```markdown
### Last Night's Reflection
> **Previous Evening**: [[5. Resources/Personal/Journal/Evening Entries/YYYY-MM-DD|Last Night's Evening]]
> - **Key insight**: <one-sentence pull from evening.content>
```

**Empty-state shape** (when `evening.found == false`):

```markdown
### Last Night's Reflection
> **Previous Evening**: NO EVENING ENTRY
> - **Key insight**:
```

- `YYYY-MM-DD` is yesterday's date — `dates.yesterday` from the gather output.
- Source for the populated Key insight: `evening.content`.
- The empty-state sentinel `NO EVENING ENTRY` is in literal caps — easy to grep, impossible to skim past. The `Key insight:` line stays present with empty value so the slot is structurally identical to the populated shape. Do not render a personal-reflection prompt in its place.
- **Only the Key insight is retained.** Drop Mood and Gratitude — both are one click away via the Previous Evening link.

### 4c: Link Resolver Rules — applies to every wikilink in the payload

Wikilink resolution is a frequent source of broken links. Follow these three rules before emitting any `[[...]]`. See Start-Day Iteration Findings 5-15 §4 for failure cases.

**Class A — Area wikilinks use basenames, not numeric-prefixed folders.**

Area dashboard files live at `3. Areas/{NumericFolder}/{AreaName}.md` (e.g. `3. Areas/1. {WorkArea}/{WorkArea}.md`). The basename is the area name, **not** the numeric-prefixed folder.

| Area | ❌ Wrong | ✅ Right |
|---|---|---|
| {WorkArea} | `[[1. {WorkArea}\|{WorkArea}]]` | `[[{WorkArea}]]` |
| {SideArea2} | `[[2. {SideArea2}\|{SideArea2}]]` | `[[{SideArea2}]]` |
| {SideArea} | `[[3. {SideArea}\|{SideArea}]]` | `[[{SideArea}]]` |
| Health & Fitness | `[[4. Health & Fitness\|Health]]` | `[[Health & Fitness\|Health]]` |
| Personal-Finance | `[[5. Personal-Finance\|Personal-Finance]]` | `[[Personal-Finance]]` |
| Personal | (root folder, no numeric prefix) | `[[Personal]]` |

**Rule:** Numeric folder prefixes are filesystem-only. They never appear in wikilinks.

**Class B — Basename collisions force a full-path alias.**

When two project hubs share a basename (e.g. `2. Projects/2. {SideArea2}/Finances/Finances.md` and `2. Projects/5. Personal-Finance/Finances/Finances.md`), a bare `[[Finances]]` is ambiguous. Detect collisions by scanning `active_projects[*].hub_path` basenames for duplicates; for any colliding entry, use the full path with an alias:

```markdown
[[2. Projects/2. {SideArea2}/Finances/Finances|{SideArea2} Finances]]
[[2. Projects/5. Personal-Finance/Finances/Finances|Personal-Finance Finances]]
```

**Class C — Project hub wikilinks come from `hub_path`, not synthesis.**

For every project, read the hub filename from `active_projects[i].hub_path` and use **that** basename as the wikilink target. Never synthesize from the project slug or display name — slugs may be hyphenated (`copilot-studio`) while the hub file may be `Copilot-Studio.md`, and the display name may have spaces that don't exist in the filename.

Procedure:
1. For each entry to render, find its `active_projects[i]` row by slug match on the file's `project:` frontmatter.
2. Take `hub_path` from that row, strip the `.md` extension, strip the directory prefix — the result is the wikilink target.
3. If two `hub_path` basenames collide (Class B), emit the full path form instead.

If no `active_projects[]` row exists for a slug (rare — usually a private project filtered out), skip the link rather than synthesizing one.

### 4d: Build the atomic payload and emit one patch

The full Recent Accomplishments payload, in order:

1. Window header line: `> **Recap Window**: M/D → M/D · N day(s) had no captured work (M/D, M/D)` (or the `beyond_lookback` escape-hatch line).
2. `### What Moved Forward` (omit if no entries).
3. `### What Changed Structurally` (omit if no entries).
4. `### Needs Attention` (omit if no entries).
5. `### Last Night's Reflection` (always rendered — populated or sentinel; see 4b).

Use MCP patch — **one call**:

```python
mcp__obsidian-mcp-tools__patch_vault_file(
    filename="5. Resources/Personal/Journal/Morning Entries/YYYY-MM-DD.md",
    operation="replace",
    targetType="heading",
    target="Recent Accomplishments",
    content="<window header + three H3 subsections + Last Night's Reflection H3>"
)
```

The patch replaces everything under `## Recent Accomplishments` up to the next `## ` boundary (the `---` divider before `## Tasks Overview`), so the entire block is rewritten atomically.

### 4e: Post-render link audit

After the patch lands, run the link audit script to verify every wikilink in the rendered journal resolves to exactly one vault file:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/start-day/scripts/audit_journal_links.sh TARGET_DATE
```

The script parses every `[[...]]` in the rendered Recent Accomplishments block and reports:
- ✅ resolves to exactly one file
- ❌ broken — no file matches
- ❌ ambiguous — multiple files match

If any link fails, **do not report success** in Step 6. Surface the failed links in the execution report and re-render with the link resolver rules (4c) applied correctly.

### 4f: Daily hub

`/start-day` does NOT write to the daily hub. The daily hub's `## Morning Brief` placeholder stays until `/process-morning` fills it after optional human input.

Do not touch the daily hub file in Step 4.

### 4g: Orphan Cluster Detection (Retroactive Devlog Proposal)

After the atomic patch in 4d lands, scan the recap window for **orphan clusters** — multiple orphan notes from the same date and same project that look like one uncaptured session. Propose a retroactive devlog interactively so tomorrow's recap stops flagging them.

**Cluster detection rules** (operate on `recap_window.days[].notes` where `orphan_candidate == true`):

1. Group orphan notes by `(date, project)` tuple.
2. For each group with **3+ orphan notes** → propose a retroactive devlog (high signal: this is almost certainly one session).
3. For groups with 1–2 orphan notes → leave the `[?]` flag, do NOT propose (insufficient signal).
4. Skip area-only notes entirely (they have no `project`, so `orphan_candidate` is always false — they never reach this step).
5. Skip the **target date** itself (today). The journal is being written *now* — those notes will be covered as the day's devlogs land. Only propose for past dates in the window.

**For each cluster (one batch of proposals, then per-cluster confirm):**

Synthesize the proposal from the note titles, project, and a quick read of each note (use `obsidian read path=...` if titles aren't enough — keep it under 30s of reading per cluster). The title should be **session-shaped** (verb-first or theme-first), not a list of every note. Examples:

- 6 notes about {Project} vocabulary and hub architecture on 5/5 → `2026-05-05 - {Project} Vocabulary Lock — Naming Decisions and Hub Architecture`
- 3 notes about {Project} pilot wiring on 5/4 → `2026-05-04 - {Project} Pilot Prep — Portability and Scheduling Wiring`

Present each cluster like this and ask the user to confirm:

```
Detected orphan cluster: 6 notes from 2026-05-05 (project: {project-slug})

Notes:
  - [[{Project} Vocabulary — Data Flow and Daily Render]]
  - [[{Project} Hierarchy — Choosing the Layer Model]]
  - [[Glossary for the {Project} Operating Model]]
  - [[{Idea Name} — Idea-Pipeline Brainstorm]]
  - [[Terminology Conflict — Two Meanings in the Current Vault]]
  - [[{Project} Daily Hub Architecture — Proposal]]

Proposed retroactive devlog:
  Title:   2026-05-05 - {Project} Vocabulary Lock — Naming Decisions and Hub Architecture
  Project: {project-slug}
  Area:    {area}
  Tasks:   (none — design session)
  Body:    wikilinks to all 6 notes + 1-line brief per note
```

Use `AskUserQuestion` (or equivalent interactive prompt) with options:
- **Create** — write the devlog as proposed
- **Edit title** — let the user supply a different title, then create
- **Skip** — leave the cluster as orphans (the user already accepts this)

**On Create:**

1. Resolve the prior {project-slug} devlog (last devlog before the cluster date) and the next {project-slug} devlog (first devlog after the cluster date) for chain-linking. Prefer:
   ```bash
   obsidian search "type: devlog project: <slug>" --limit 50
   ```
   then sort by date and pick the immediate neighbors. QMD is a backup.

2. Write the devlog file at `2. Projects/{Area}/{Project}/Dev Log/{Title}.md` using the Devlog Template's frontmatter shape:
   ```yaml
   ---
   date: <cluster-date>
   type: devlog
   status: capture
   area: <area>
   project: <slug>
   session_topic: <verb-first description derived from title>
   tasks: []                # design session — no task link
   tags: [devlog]
   ---
   ```

3. Body content (concise — this is a retroactive reconstruction, not a fresh log):
   ```markdown
   # <Title>

   > **Project**: [[Project Hub]]
   > **Previous <project> devlog**: [[<prior devlog title>]]
   > **Next <project> devlog**: [[<next devlog title>]]
   > **Note**: Retroactively reconstructed by /start-day on <today> from an orphan cluster — the session happened but no devlog was written at the time.

   ## Notes produced this session

   - [[<note 1 title>]] — <1-line brief from note's first paragraph or its own callout>
   - [[<note 2 title>]] — <1-line brief>
   - ...

   ## Why retroactive

   These N notes share `date: <cluster-date>` and `project: <slug>` with no covering devlog. They cross-link and read as one design session. This devlog closes the orphan loop so tomorrow's recap groups them under their session intent.
   ```

4. Update the **next** devlog's `Previous:` link if it currently points to the prior devlog (now there's a new one in between). Same for the prior's `Next:` link if it pointed forward to the next. Use `obsidian property:set` or a small inline edit.

5. Confirm to the user: `Created [[<Title>]] — N orphans now covered.`

**On Edit title:** prompt for new title (single line), then proceed with steps 1–5 using the new title.

**On Skip:** move on to the next cluster.

**After all clusters processed:** report a one-liner summary in Step 6's execution report (e.g., `- Orphan clusters: 2 detected, 1 created, 1 skipped`).

## Step 5: Linear → Todoist Sync

For each Linear issue at the **task level** (not user stories), check if a Todoist mirror exists:

```bash
td task list --filter "search:RS4-xxx" --json
```

If no mirror exists, propose creation (batch — show all proposed tasks, then create):

```bash
td task add "Verb-first description (Linear RS4-xxx)" --project "{SideArea2}" --labels "@{sidearea2-slug}" --priority p2
```

**Naming**: Use the Linear title if verb-first and specific. Rewrite vague titles.
**Completion**: Todoist leads, external systems follow. If Linear shows Done but the Todoist mirror is open, flag it: `*(Linear RS4-xxx, resolved upstream — close?)*`

## Step 5b: Commit the Daily Scaffold

Snapshot the day's starting state in the vault git repo so later Morning Brief input shows up as a distinct modification in git history (`/vault-commit` would otherwise fold scaffold and input into one commit):

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/start-day/scripts/commit_daily_scaffold.sh TARGET_DATE
```

The script commits **only** the daily hub (`1. Daily/TARGET_DATE.md`) and the Morning Brief (`5. Resources/Personal/Journal/Morning Entries/TARGET_DATE.md`) with the message `chore: start-day scaffold for TARGET_DATE`. Everything else dirty in the vault is left for `/vault-commit`.

Parse the JSON output:
- `{committed: true, sha, ...}` — report the commit in Step 6's execution report.
- `{committed: false, reason: "no_changes"}` — re-run with nothing new; report as skipped, not a failure.
- `{committed: false, error: "..."}` — the commit failed. **Warn, don't abort**: continue to Step 6 and surface the error in the Warnings section. The Morning Brief is already prepared; a missed snapshot must not block the workflow.

## Step 6: Report Results

Merge the gather script's `source_manifest` with MCP tool results into a unified execution report (per `vault-config/references/source-manifest.md`):

```markdown
Morning prep complete for YYYY-MM-DD.

**Yesterday**: N devlog sessions
**Carry-forward**: N tasks (M overdue)

Morning Brief prepared → [[5. Resources/Personal/Journal/Morning Entries/YYYY-MM-DD]]
Review it when you begin work; add voice or written context only if useful.

### Execution Report
#### Sources
- [x] Obsidian CLI — Morning Brief read, daily hub read, N devlogs found
- [x] Todoist overdue/today — N items
- [ ] GWS Calendar — FAILED: auth token expired
- [x] Linear in-progress — N items
- [x] QMD Search — backup search, N results
- [x] Evening reflection — found
- [x] Scaffold commit — abc1234 `chore: start-day scaffold for YYYY-MM-DD`

#### Warnings
- GWS integration unavailable. Run `gws auth login` to refresh.
- N devlogs found with no task linked.

#### Fix
- GWS: Run `gws auth login` to refresh OAuth token
```

Only include Warnings and Fix sections if there are actual issues. Script-tracked sources use `source_manifest` values; MCP-tracked sources (Linear, QMD) use your own tracking from Step 2.

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Single-day window (yesterday only) | Render window header + three-section brief (What Moved Forward / Changed Structurally / Needs Attention) — omit any empty subsection |
| Multi-day window with gaps (e.g. Mon after long weekend) | Render window header summarizing gap days, then the three-section brief synthesized across the whole window — no per-day subsections |
| 4-day offline (3-day tier finds nothing, 5-day finds work) | Tiered lookback handles automatically — window extends to 5 days back |
| Full week off (5-day finds nothing, 7-day catches it) | Tiered lookback handles automatically — window extends to 7 days back |
| Beyond 7 days idle (`beyond_lookback: true`) | Render escape-hatch message with `--since` invocation hint; skip the three-section brief |
| Day in window has only journal/daily/private files | Day appears in `days_empty`, not rendered as a section |
| Knowledge note exists but no covering devlog (orphan) | Appears as a `- [?]` sub-bullet under its project's parent bullet in What Moved Forward, with the `*(orphan note — no devlog covered this)*` suffix |
| Private project files | Silently excluded by gather script + per-file `private: true` stamp written to file frontmatter (one-way) |
| No Todoist tasks | "No overdue tasks" |
| Linear unavailable | Continue — note in source manifest |
| Morning Brief already has context | Replace existing prepared context (re-run safe) |
| Re-run with no scaffold changes since last commit | Step 5b skips with `reason: no_changes` — no duplicate commit |
| Re-run that changed the rendered context | Step 5b commits a fresh snapshot (same message) — legitimate, not a duplicate |
| Scaffold commit fails (merge in progress, locked index) | Warn in execution report, do not abort — Morning Brief is already prepared |

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Extract priorities from optional Morning Brief input (that's `/process-morning`)
- Create Todoist tasks from Morning Brief input (that's `/process-morning`)
- Process voice transcripts
- Complete Linear items (reads state, mirrors to Todoist)
- Does not write task lists to the Morning Brief or daily hub (Bases queries render tasks from frontmatter)
- Does not create task notes (that's `/process-morning`)
- Does not commit anything beyond the day's scaffold (hub + Morning Brief) — `/vault-commit` owns all other commits
