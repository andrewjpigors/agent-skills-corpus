name: level3-tracker-loop
description: Use when training, evaluating, tuning, or analyzing the v54/v55 Level3 low-level PPO reference tracker as a trajectory-following controller, before planner integration. Use for tracker qualification curricula such as hover, point hold, point reach, straight-line tracking, L-shaped tracking, curved trajectory tracking, braking-to-point, heading tracking, multi-point reference following, optional gate-aperture diagnostics, and deciding whether the tracker is ready for a planner-driven Level3 run. Use this instead of level3-ppo-loop when the question is about proving the bottom PPO can accurately, smoothly, and stably follow reference points/trajectories rather than directly optimizing Level3 gate-pass success.

# Level3 Tracker Loop

Use this workflow for the v54 low-level PPO tracker. The tracker is not the
global racer. Its first job is to behave like a reliable flying base:

```text
reference trajectory -> PPO tracker -> roll / pitch / yaw / thrust
```

Planner integration is allowed only after the tracker proves it can follow
short reference trajectories without overshooting, crashing, or producing
aggressive actions.

## Contract

- Target final race config remains unchanged: `config/level3.toml`.
- Tracker source files:
  - `lsy_drone_racing/control/level3_reference_tracker.py`;
  - `lsy_drone_racing/control/train_level3_reference_tracker_ppo.py`;
  - `lsy_drone_racing/control/level3_reference_tracker_controller.py`;
  - `scripts/check_level3_reference_tracker_smoke.py`.
- State file remains:
  `experiments/level3_ppo_loop/state.json`.
- W&B project remains: `ADR-PPO-Racing-Level3`.
- Current v54 hold packet:
  `experiments/level3_ppo_loop/decisions/2026-06-25_v54_reference_tracker_hold_long_training.md`.
- Current v54 long-training prep analysis:
  `experiments/level3_ppo_loop/analysis/2026-06-25_v54_reference_tracker_long_training_prep.md`.
- Current v54 finding: do not launch long Level3 training until the tracker
  passes qualification tasks and strict smoke. The last prep had finite actions
  and first-gate progress but `0/20` gate-0 passes on seeds `101-120`.

## Core Principle

Separate the two problems:

```text
planner quality:
  can the upper planner generate safe, low-speed, visible-geometry references?

tracker quality:
  can the PPO follow reference points and trajectories precisely and smoothly?
```

Do not use Level3 gate pass as the first tracker learning exam. Use gate pass as
an integration test after the tracker passes reference-following exams.

For v58 and later, the user clarified an important correction: do not teach the
bottom tracker gate semantics. "Reference following" means following a generic
short trajectory command, not blindly chasing a single point and not learning
to pass gates. The planner must tell the tracker both geometry and low-level
intent:

```text
current_reference_point
next_reference_point
lookahead_reference_point
desired_velocity
desired_speed
desired_heading
generic hold / low-speed / pass-through command intent
last_action / short history
```

The concrete flight command is primary. A label or mask is only an auxiliary
hint, and the next lane should avoid gate/aperture wording in the tracker
interface. Do not train or analyze the tracker as if the PPO should infer
behavior from `waypoint_type` alone. The reference horizon, desired
speed/velocity, and desired heading should already make the intended maneuver
visible:

```text
hold/brake: current point and near-future points barely move, desired speed is low
low-speed pass-through: future points continue forward, desired speed is low but nonzero
speed recovery: future points move away from the constrained segment, speed ramps up smoothly
```

The tracker must learn generic trajectory-command behaviors:

```text
pass_through: keep moving smoothly through the point
hold_or_brake: slow to about 0.0-0.1 m/s and stabilize
low_speed_through: do not stop dead, but move through at about 0.25-0.35 m/s
recover_speed: resume speed gradually after the constrained segment
```

Do not reduce this to ordinary point chasing, and do not reduce it to label
classification. If every reference horizon looks like a pass-through command,
the tracker can learn to rush through all points and still fail Level3 by
overshooting, failing to brake, or contacting near the gate plane.

Do not add gate-pass, aperture-crossing, finish, race-progress, or
stage-progress rewards to the bottom tracker. Gate pass belongs to planner
integration smoke and final Level3 evaluation, not to tracker learning.

The clean v60 baseline must also remove gate/obstacle/planner-phase inputs from
the actor observation. Use `level3_reference_tracker_command_v3`, containing
only self state, reference horizon, desired velocity/speed/heading, generic
command masks, last action, and short history. Keep older v1/v2 layouts loadable
for existing checkpoints and diagnostics, but do not use them as the v60 clean
baseline.

The clean v60 reward path must also be separate from the legacy gate-capable
tracker reward. Use `ReferenceCommandReward` for
`reference_command_no_gate_reward`; keep `ReferenceTrackerReward` /
`LegacyTrackerReward` only for old v1/v2 paths and `gate_aperture_reference`
diagnostics. V60 reward diagnostics must not compute gate-center, gate-progress,
gate-cross, gate-recover, gate-linger, obstacle, finish, race-progress, or
stage-progress terms.

As of the command-trajectory update, v60 input stays fixed at
`level3_reference_tracker_command_v3`; the reward, not the observation, now
does more of the work. `ReferenceCommandReward` should treat the short horizon
`current -> next -> lookahead` as the driving command. For moving commands
(`pass_through`, `low_speed_through`, `recover_speed`), reward path following
with cross-track error, along-track speed error, reverse-speed penalty, and
along-horizon progress rather than pure distance to the current point. For
`hold_or_brake`, keep point accuracy and low speed dominant, and penalize
overshoot past the brake point along the horizon direction. Keep these terms
generic: no gate, aperture, obstacle, planner-phase, finish, race-progress, or
stage-progress reward may be introduced into v60.

As of the dense-command-generator update, v60 training references must be
planner-like rolling mini-trajectories, not sparse waypoints. For moving
commands (`pass_through`, `low_speed_through`, `recover_speed`), set
`desired_velocity` mainly along the visible horizon `current -> lookahead`.
For `hold_or_brake`, keep `current`, `next`, and `lookahead` clustered near the
brake/hold point and make `desired_velocity` near zero. Keep per-step reference
motion consistent with `desired_speed * dt` so a low-speed command does not
hide a large target jump. Randomize direction, length, height, curvature,
speed, phase duration, braking distance, slow-through distance, and recovery
angle so the tracker learns generic command following rather than one memorized
path. The sequence should resemble a conservative Level3 planner approach:
smooth cruise, slowdown/hold, low-speed-through, then smooth recovery.
Do not switch abruptly from cruise speed to zero-speed hold. The pass-through
approach must include a deceleration ramp before `hold_or_brake`: desired speed
should taper from roughly `0.55-0.78m/s` down to about `0.15-0.24m/s`, with
reference-point spacing shrinking consistently, before the stationary hold
horizon takes over. This teaches "fly -> slow down -> stop", not "fly -> panic
stop".

For v59, the tracker may gain a small local safety reflex, but it must not
become an autonomous Level3 racer. Treat this as:

```text
planner: decides the route, slowdown, and reference horizon
tracker: follows the reference horizon
local safety reflex: only nudges behavior near collision margins
```

Allowed v59 safety inputs are lightweight local quantities such as nearest
visible obstacle relative position, obstacle distance/detected, and, only after
builder/checker approval, a small gate-frame clearance or nearest-frame
direction feature. Do not add full target-gate semantics, gate progress, gate
pass phase, finish state, or stage progress as tracker-reflex inputs. Those
signals make the bottom policy drift toward solving the race itself.

Keep the reward dominated by reference following:

```text
80-90%: position/horizon tracking, velocity or speed tracking, heading tracking,
        smooth actions, braking/hold behavior when commanded
10-20%: crash, near-obstacle, or near-frame safety penalties, active mainly
        inside a safety margin
```

Do not add gate-pass, finish, race-progress, or stage-progress bonuses to v59.
The intended behavior is "track the planner command, but do not collide when a
small local correction is available", not "learn a second gate-passing policy".

Planner integration smoke should start with the deterministic
`GeometricSlowGatePlanner` in
`lsy_drone_racing/control/level3_reference_tracker.py`, not MPPI/MPC. It is a
conservative five-phase state machine: cruise, slowdown, align, cross, recover.
It outputs only short-horizon reference points, desired speed, and heading; the
PPO tracker remains the only action source.

## Research Reference

When changing tracker observations, reward terms, qualification tasks, PPO
training schedule, or planner-integration gates, first read:

```text
.agents/skills/level3-tracker-loop/references/tracker-ppo-training.md
```

That file records the source-backed tracker-training pattern from DATT,
OmniDrones, safe-control-gym, quadrotor racing papers, and PPO implementation
notes. Keep `SKILL.md` procedural and update the reference file when new durable
evidence changes how tracker PPO should be trained.

Current v55 training-environment memory:

```text
experiments/level3_ppo_loop/research/2026-06-25_v55_tracker_training_environment_memory.md
```

Use it when deciding whether tracker training should run in free space, a
gate-aperture mini environment, or unchanged `config/level3.toml` smoke.

Current v55 training-budget research:

```text
experiments/level3_ppo_loop/research/2026-06-25_v55_tracker_training_budget_research.md
```

Use it when deciding whether a tracker stage has been trained long enough,
whether to extend the same stage, or whether a failure justifies changing
reward, curriculum, observation, PPO structure, or planner integration.

Current v55 machine-readable completion gates:

```text
experiments/level3_ppo_loop/tracker_qualification_gates.json
```

Use this gate spec with:

```bash
pixi run -e tests python scripts/check_level3_tracker_stage_gate.py \
  --stage <stage_id> \
  --metrics-json <stage_eval_metrics.json>
```

Generate the stage metrics JSON with:

```bash
pixi run -e gpu python scripts/evaluate_level3_tracker_stage.py \
  --stage <stage_id> \
  --checkpoint <tracker_checkpoint.ckpt> \
  --output <stage_eval_metrics.json>
```

When starting any stage after `hover`, add `--require-prerequisites` and pass a
history JSON that marks prior stages as passed. The stage checker must pass
before the next stage is unlocked.

## Qualification Ladder

Train and evaluate in this order. Do not skip directly to full Level3 unless a
packet explains why the lower rungs are already proven.

1. `hover`
   - hold near a fixed target;
   - prioritize survival, low velocity, low action delta, and final position
     error.
2. `point_hold`
   - reach a point and stay near it;
   - require braking instead of flying through the target.
3. `point_reach`
   - travel from A to B at low speed;
   - measure final error, overshoot, time-to-target, and crash rate.
4. `line_tracking`
   - follow a straight short trajectory with desired velocity;
   - measure cross-track error and speed error.
5. `brake_to_point`
   - approach a point and reduce speed before arrival;
   - reject policies that only get close by overshooting.
6. `heading_tracking`
   - align desired heading while moving or hovering;
   - measure heading error without allowing large attitude commands.
7. `multi_point_reference`
   - follow multiple reference points with smooth switching;
   - measure jerk/action-delta and accumulated tracking error.
8. `l_shape_tracking`
   - follow a simple L-shaped route;
   - require stable turning without large overshoot.
9. `curve_tracking`
   - follow a small smooth curve;
   - require low cross-track error and no oscillation.
10. `zigzag_or_lemniscate_tracking`
    - follow sharper but still short held-out curves;
    - require low tracking error without unstable corrective actions.
11. `reference_command_no_gate_reward`
    - follow planner-like generic command sequences;
    - distinguish pass-through, hold/brake, low-speed-through, and speed recovery
      without gate/aperture rewards.
12. `planner_integration_smoke`
    - run unchanged `config/level3.toml` with `GeometricSlowGatePlanner` and
      the PPO tracker.

Optional diagnostic: `gate_aperture_reference` may be used to inspect whether a
planner-generated pre-gate -> aperture -> post-gate reference is trackable, but
it is not a required tracker-training stage. The planner owns aperture crossing
semantics; the bottom PPO owns reference tracking.

After v57a, the next tracker lane should be a named semantic-reference stage,
not a repeat of the generic ladder. Use:

```text
v60_reference_command_tracker_no_gate_reward
```

This stage should train on planner-like short trajectories where the concrete
future points, speed, velocity, and heading encode the maneuver. Command masks
are auxiliary. Minimal reference families:

- cruise pass-through points with target speed about `0.6-1.0m/s`;
- hold/brake points with target speed about `0.0-0.1m/s`;
- low-speed-through segments with target speed about `0.25-0.35m/s`;
- speed-recovery points that restore speed gradually;
- mixed sequences such as
  `pass_through -> hold_or_brake -> low_speed_through -> recover_speed`.

The observation, reward, and evaluation must make the intended flight command
visible or measurable. If current/next/lookahead points, desired
speed/velocity, desired heading, and optional command masks cannot represent
hold intent or low-speed-through intent, v60 must include a small
observation-layout change with builder/checker approval before long training.
As of the clean baseline update, that layout is
`level3_reference_tracker_command_v3`, and it must not contain gate, obstacle,
or phase features.

## Metrics

Every tracker qualification analysis must report the relevant subset of:

- mean and median position error;
- final position error;
- cross-track error for line/L/curve tasks;
- desired velocity error;
- terminal speed near target;
- overshoot distance;
- heading error;
- crash / termination / timeout rate;
- mean action norm;
- action delta / smoothness;
- finite action and finite observation checks;
- W&B run URL;
- checkpoint path;
- exact task command and seed range.

For no-gate command reference training, additionally report:

- per-waypoint-type position and velocity error;
- brake/hold terminal speed and dwell stability;
- low-speed-through speed error through the constrained segment;
- overshoot after brake/hold points;
- velocity reduction from approach speed to commanded low-speed-through speed;
- wrong-command failures, such as rushing through brake points or stopping
  dead at low-speed-through points;
- waypoint-type confusion rates if an explicit classifier/one-hot interface is
  used.

For planner integration smoke, additionally report:

- nonzero first-gate progress count;
- gate-0 pass count;
- early termination count;
- `config/level3.toml` unchanged check.

## Promotion Gates

Each stage has a concrete completion gate in
`experiments/level3_ppo_loop/tracker_qualification_gates.json`. The loop may
continue to the next stage only after `scripts/check_level3_tracker_stage_gate.py`
returns success for the current stage. Missing metrics fail closed.

Do not approve planner-driven long Level3 training until all are true:

- tracker tasks are checkpoint-backed and action-finite;
- hover/point/line tasks show low final error and no systematic crash;
- multi-point/L/curve tasks show bounded overshoot and smooth action changes;
- braking task shows low terminal speed near the target;
- the first 10 free-space tracker stages through `zigzag_or_lemniscate_tracking`
  are checkpoint-backed and passed;
- planner integration smoke on unchanged `config/level3.toml` seeds at least
  `101-120` has majority first-gate progress and at least one gate-0 pass.

If these fail, write a hold packet. Do not give a fake long-training command.

## Workflow

1. Read, in order:
   - `AGENTS.md`;
   - this skill;
   - `.agents/skills/level3-tracker-loop/references/tracker-ppo-training.md`
     when changing tracker observation, reward, curriculum, training schedule,
     or promotion gates;
   - `experiments/level3_ppo_loop/state.json`;
   - the latest v54 analysis and decision packet.
2. Identify the next missing qualification rung. Prefer the lowest unproven
   tracker skill over a full Level3 run.
3. If code or training semantics must change, use builder/checker:
   - builder implements the smallest change;
   - checker is read-only and verifies commands, semantics, and unchanged
     `config/level3.toml`;
   - main agent decides after checker, never builder.
4. Run bounded W&B-tracked training. This is qualification, not long training.
5. Run task-specific evaluation/smoke before any planner smoke.
6. Write an analysis packet under `experiments/level3_ppo_loop/analysis/`.
7. Write a main decision packet under `experiments/level3_ppo_loop/decisions/`
   choosing one of:
   `hold_for_more_analysis`, `continue_same_hypothesis`,
   `change_tracker_curriculum_or_reward`, `promote_to_planner_integration`, or
   `approve_manual_long_training_command`.
8. Write a plain Chinese reader note under `drone_notes/level3_loops/`.
9. Update `state.json`.
10. Commit intended small files and push to `aojili-test/main`.

## Autonomous Required-Stage Goal Protocol

When the user launches a `/goal` for the full tracker ladder, run exactly one
stage at a time:

```text
train current stage
-> evaluate current stage with scripts/evaluate_level3_tracker_stage.py
-> check current stage with scripts/check_level3_tracker_stage_gate.py
-> if pass, update state and unlock next stage
-> if fail, analyze, change the smallest useful thing, and retry the same stage
```

The current required stage follows the `next_stage` chain in
`experiments/level3_ppo_loop/tracker_qualification_gates.json`, ignoring stages
marked `optional_diagnostic`. If the first 10 tracker stages are passed, the next
required stage is `planner_integration_smoke`, not `gate_aperture_reference`.

On a failed stage gate, spawn exactly three analysis subagents before changing
training structure or reward:

- `tracker_eval_metrics`: inspect the stage metrics JSON, gate failures, episode
  rows, crash/termination patterns, overshoot, terminal speed, and action
  smoothness.
- `tracker_wandb_ppo`: inspect W&B curves for the stage run: episode return,
  tracker reward components, policy loss, value loss, entropy, clip fraction,
  and signs of undertraining or PPO instability.
- `tracker_structure_research`: inspect whether the fix should be more
  training time, reward numbers, curriculum difficulty, observation features,
  PPO hyperparameters, or a small code/config correction. Use local evidence
  first and external research only when it materially changes the decision.

The main agent must synthesize those reviews into a decision packet under
`experiments/level3_ppo_loop/decisions/` before retrying. Allowed decisions are:
`continue_same_stage_more_steps`, `change_tracker_reward_numbers`,
`change_tracker_curriculum_or_eval`, `launch_tracker_structural_fix`, or
`hold_for_user_review`.

If the decision changes observation layout, reward semantics, trainer behavior,
evaluator semantics, controller behavior, or loop orchestration, use the
builder/checker gate before training again. The checker must be read-only and
must verify unchanged `config/level3.toml`.

Do not approve planner-driven Level3 long training until the required tracker
ladder through `zigzag_or_lemniscate_tracking` is passed and
`planner_integration_smoke` passes on unchanged `config/level3.toml`.

## Long-Stage Training Policy

Short smoke runs are only plumbing checks. They verify that the trainer,
checkpoint writer, W&B logging, evaluator, and gate checker can run. They are
not enough evidence to decide that PPO did or did not learn a tracker skill.

For each learning stage:

1. Run a short preflight smoke using the stage's
   `training_budget.preflight_smoke_timesteps` from
   `experiments/level3_ppo_loop/tracker_qualification_gates.json`.
2. If smoke fails due to NaNs, non-finite actions/observations, trainer or
   evaluator errors, invalid checkpoint metadata, or `config/level3.toml`
   mutation, treat it as a semantic/plumbing failure and use builder/checker.
3. If smoke is clean, run a bounded stage-maturation chunk with explicit
   `--total-timesteps`, W&B enabled, and `--checkpoint-interval` from the stage
   `training_budget`.
4. Evaluate milestone checkpoints, not only the final checkpoint.
5. Judge stage completion only from checkpoint-backed milestone evaluation plus
   the stage gate checker.

Do not mark a learning stage failed based only on `<=100000` timesteps unless
the failure is a semantic/plumbing failure such as NaNs, non-finite actions,
broken evaluation, invalid checkpoint metadata, or `config/level3.toml`
changes. Tiny runs can reject broken code; they cannot reject PPO learning.

Default stage-maturation budgets are machine-readable in the gate spec:

```text
hover: 1M
point_hold: 2M
point_reach, brake_to_point, heading_tracking: 4M
line_tracking: 5M
multi_point_reference, l_shape_tracking: 8M
curve_tracking: 10M
zigzag_or_lemniscate_tracking: 12M
reference_command_no_gate_reward: 8M default, 20M research extension
planner_integration_smoke: no new training, evaluate only
gate_aperture_reference: optional diagnostic only, no default maturation
```

Tracker learning chunks must use vectorized environments. The single-env
trainer path is now only for tiny debug/smoke checks. The default maturation
rollout geometry follows the successful Level2/Level3 PPO precedent:

```text
1024 envs x 32 steps = 32768 samples/update
```

If W&B/milestone analysis suggests this has too little temporal credit horizon
for a tracker stage, a main-agent decision packet may switch that stage to the
known longer-rollout variant:

```text
256 envs x 128 steps = 32768 samples/update
```

These are bounded chunks, not infinite training approval. If a stage still
fails after its default maturation chunk, run the three failure-review subagents
before changing reward, curriculum, PPO hyperparameters, network size, or the
budget. At least one review must explicitly answer whether the failure is more
consistent with undertraining, bad reward/metrics, bad curriculum difficulty,
PPO instability, or insufficient observation/control authority.

For v61 packaged PPO backends, use the packet
`experiments/level3_ppo_loop/analysis/2026-06-27_v61_packaged_ppo_backend_probe.md`.
SBX PPO was tested and rejected as too slow for the main speed route; do not
restart it as a long-training backend. The speed-oriented package route is
Brax. `scripts/benchmark_v60_brax_rollout.py` now proves that the v60 command
tracker rollout can be represented as a `brax.envs.base.State` JAX scan. Its
post-warm-up `1024 envs x 32 steps` rollout is much faster than the current
PyTorch fast path, but it does not include PPO updates or checkpoint export yet.
The next promotion step is a real Brax PPO adapter/checkpoint path plus bounded
PPO smoke; do not launch long training directly from the rollout benchmark.

When changing the budget table or rejecting a stage as undertrained, create a
research/budget packet under `experiments/level3_ppo_loop/research/` using:

- local W&B and milestone curves;
- local Level2/Level3 step-curve experience;
- papers and GitHub examples for quadrotor tracking or drone racing PPO;
- hardware/runtime constraints.

The main agent, not the research subagent, owns the final budget decision.

## Training Guidance

- Prefer a dedicated tracker qualification script or task mode over direct
  Level3 reward tuning.
- Observation should include local/body-frame reference error and a short future
  reference horizon, plus desired velocity/speed, heading/yaw error, drone
  velocity/attitude/body-rate features, and previous action/history where
  available.
- Keep reward local to tracker behavior: tracking error, velocity error,
  heading error, braking terminal speed, overshoot, action smoothness,
  uprightness/spin, and crash/timeout. Do not use global race progress as the
  first tracker-learning reward.
- Increase reference difficulty in stages: fixed/easy references first, then
  randomized starts/endpoints/speeds/curvature, then disturbances/latency/domain
  randomization after nominal tracking works.
- During analysis, inspect PPO diagnostics such as approximate KL, clip
  fraction, entropy/action std, value loss, explained variance, and reward
  scale relative to value clipping.
- Keep training chunks bounded but explicit. The trainer default
  `--total-timesteps 4096` is only a smoke value; every real learning run must
  set `--total-timesteps` and `--checkpoint-interval`.
- Use W&B for live PPO metrics and tracker diagnostics.
- Keep generated checkpoints, smoke JSONs, W&B directories, logs, caches, and
  trajectory dumps out of git.
- Do not record tracker qualification success as final Level3 success.
- Do not modify `config/level3.toml`.

## Common Next Move

Given the current state, the previous v58 lane is held and the next useful lane
is:

```text
v60_reference_command_tracker_no_gate_reward
```

The v55 qualification ladder is already useful evidence that the tracker can
follow basic free-space references, but v57/v57a showed that Level3 failure now
depends on planner-like command execution:

```text
the tracker must follow a horizon that tells it whether to keep moving, brake /
hold, move slowly through a constrained segment, or recover speed.
```

The first v60 implementation target is a builder/checker-gated redesign of the
held v58 stage. It should add or revise task support, observation features if
needed, reward terms, and evaluation metrics for generic trajectory-command
segments. Acceptance is not Level3 success rate. It is evidence that the
tracker can follow concrete horizon/speed/heading commands for pass-through,
hold/brake, low-speed-through, and speed recovery with bounded tracking error,
low overshoot, and correct speed behavior. Labels or masks are supporting
diagnostics only.

For v60, the reward must be local:

- command-aware position/horizon tracking;
- cross-track error to the `current -> next -> lookahead` mini-trajectory;
- along-track desired-speed tracking and reverse-speed penalty for moving
  commands;
- brake/hold overshoot past the commanded stop point;
- desired speed or velocity tracking;
- desired heading tracking;
- terminal speed and dwell stability when the command is hold/brake;
- low but nonzero speed tracking when the command is low-speed-through;
- speed recovery tracking when the command is recover-speed;
- action smoothness, uprightness/spin, and crash/timeout penalties.

It must not include:

- gate-pass bonus;
- aperture-crossing bonus;
- finish bonus;
- race progress;
- stage progress;
- gate-plane or target-gate transition reward.
- obstacle reward in the clean v60 baseline.

As of the v55 architecture clarification, `gate_aperture_reference` is no longer
part of the required ladder. Do not continue reward-shaped gate-aperture PPO
training by default; use the zigzag-qualified tracker in planner integration
smoke and diagnose failures as either planner-reference design problems or
tracker reference-following gaps.

The first planner smoke implementation is `GeometricSlowGatePlanner`: a slow
deterministic gate-frame planner with phase hysteresis, near-gate slowdown,
pre-gate alignment, pre/aperture/post/recovery references, and a simple visible
obstacle waypoint offset. If planner smoke fails, inspect the generated
references before adding MPPI or retraining the tracker.

As of v57a, the cross-entry reference discontinuity has been reduced from about
`0.74m` to `0.28m`, but gate0 pass/contact did not improve and phase4 speed
remained too high. That result originally triggered v58 semantic tracker
training. The user has now corrected that route: do not train a gate-semantic
tracker. Train a generic no-gate-reward command tracker first.

The next optional extension after v60 is:

```text
v59_reference_tracker_with_local_safety_reflex
```

Use v59 only if no-gate command-tracker training or planner smoke still shows
contact caused by small local obstacle/frame errors after the reference command
itself is continuous and trackable. The first v59 check should audit existing
obstacle-relative observation and obstacle-penalty support before changing the
observation layout. Keep gate/race progress rewards disabled for this lane.

For the next planner-only gate-front tuning lane, use the repo skill:

```text
.agents/skills/level3-geometric-planner-loop/SKILL.md
```

That skill owns `v56_geometric_gate_crossing_tuning_loop`: fixed seeds
`101-120`, 500-step trace smoke, no PPO training, no checkpoint changes, no
`config/level3.toml` edits, and task metrics for align stabilization, cross
slowdown, near-plane backout, and recover-after-real-gate-switch behavior.

## Speed Backend Notes

SBX was tested as a packaged PPO backend and rejected for this project because
it remained too slow for the v60 tracker speed problem. Keep the active
speed-oriented route on the Brax/JAX side.

The current backend evidence is:

- `scripts/benchmark_v60_brax_rollout.py`: pure JAX/Brax-style rollout probe,
  about `1.6M env steps/s` after compile on `1024 envs x 32 steps`;
- `scripts/train_v60_brax_ppo_smoke.py`: minimal JAX actor-critic + JAX rollout
  + GAE + clipped PPO + Optax update + checkpoint + W&B smoke. A
  `262144`-step smoke reached about `1.27M env steps/s` steady-state, roughly
  `31.9x` the PyTorch fast path, while keeping finite metrics and saving a
  loadable checkpoint;
- `scripts/train_v62_brax_reference_command_tracker.py`: formal maintained
  lane with checkpoint milestones, final checkpoint, resume metadata, W&B, and
  deterministic pre/post eval. A bounded `1,048,576`-step run reached about
  `1.3047M env steps/s` steady-state, roughly `32.78x` the PyTorch fast path.
  PPO stayed finite, with final KL about `0.000248`, but deterministic eval
  worsened and `has_eval_learning_signal=false`.

Treat v62 as backend plumbing evidence, not a tracker-stage pass. Do not launch
an 8M+ v62/v60 maturation run from the current configuration. Next, create a
v62b learning-signal fix: reduce exploration pressure, address the mismatch
between unclipped Gaussian log-prob and clipped env actions or implement a
squashed-action PPO path, add reward scaling/return normalization, then rerun
the same bounded 1M pre/post eval gate.

The v62b signal audit is now recorded in
`experiments/level3_ppo_loop/analysis/2026-06-27_v62b_brax_ppo_signal_audit.md`.
Before reward tuning, check action sampling/logprob consistency, advantage
scale, reward scale, and initial std. The default `initial_log_std=-0.5` failed:
std `0.6065`, any-dim action clipping `34.34%`, raw-vs-clipped logprob abs mean
`0.3427`, advantage mean/std `-36.41/33.90`, and reward mean `-3.21`. The v62
final checkpoint still had any-dim clipping `40.12%` and logprob mismatch
`0.3968`. `initial_log_std=-2.0` passed all audit verdicts. Keep the clean
no-gate reward unchanged for the next v62b fix; first lower initial std, lower
or disable entropy pressure, and make the PPO logprob path consistent with the
environment action.

The v62b 10M fix is recorded in
`experiments/level3_ppo_loop/analysis/2026-06-27_v62b_brax_ppo_signal_fix_10m.md`.
The code now defaults to `initial_log_std=-2.0` and `ent_coef=0.0`, stores the
env-executed bounded action in the PPO batch, and computes the stored logprob
from that same action. The 10,027,008-step run kept action clipping and
logprob/env-action consistency error at `0.0`, ran around `1.297M env steps/s`,
and produced positive deterministic eval signal: reward `-4.1090 -> -2.7413`,
position error `0.5153 -> 0.4006`, cross-track error `0.4351 -> 0.2803`, and
done mean `0.00417 -> 0.0`. Velocity error worsened and value/advantage scale
remained high in the final training batch. Next, evaluate saved milestones and
inspect value/return scale before reward tuning.

The v62c formal action-distribution support is recorded in
`experiments/level3_ppo_loop/analysis/2026-06-27_v62c_tanh_squashed_gaussian_support.md`.
The user chose the formal long-training path: use `tanh_squashed_gaussian`
with tanh-Jacobian logprob correction as the preferred v62 action distribution.
Keep `clipped_gaussian` only as an explicit compatibility fallback. The v62c
smoke/audit checks showed action clipping `0.0`, stored-vs-env logprob abs mean
about `3.21e-7`, and unchanged Level3/tracker configs. Do not resume v62b
clipped-Gaussian checkpoints into v62c unless a future decision explicitly
approves a cross-distribution experiment. The next step is a bounded v62c 10M
W&B run, not immediate 60M+ maturation or reward tuning.

The v62c 10M learning-sanity run is recorded in
`experiments/level3_ppo_loop/analysis/2026-06-27_v62c_tanh_squashed_gaussian_10m_analysis.md`.
It produced positive eval signal with the formal tanh action path: reward
`-4.6670 -> -3.0376`, position error `0.4990 -> 0.4440`, cross-track error
`0.4116 -> 0.3254`, and done mean `0.0064 -> 0.0`. The final checkpoint audit
kept action/logprob/std/reward/advantage verdicts ok. Treat this as evidence
that JAX/Brax v62c can learn and should remain the active speed backend.
Do not jump to 60M+ yet: velocity error worsened, action magnitude/delta
increased, and train-batch value loss stayed high. Next perform
`v62c_milestone_value_velocity_review` before changing reward or budget.

The v62c milestone value/velocity review is recorded in
`experiments/level3_ppo_loop/analysis/2026-06-27_v62c_milestone_value_velocity_review.md`.
Under the same 16-rollout tracker eval protocol, `7M` is the best overall
checkpoint and the least-bad trained velocity checkpoint; `2M` is best only for
position/cross-track; final is worse than `7M` on reward, position, cross-track,
velocity, done rate, and balanced score. Velocity obedience remains the hard
blocker: velocity error is already worse than initial at `1M` and never
recovers below initial; within the trained curve, `8M` starts post-peak
velocity worsening after the `7M` best point. Do not launch 60M+ v62c maturation
or resume from final. Next use builder/checker for
`v62d_value_velocity_stabilization_support`: keep the tanh-squashed action
path, clean command-v3 observation, and no-gate/no-aperture/no-race reward
boundary while addressing value/return scale and generic command-velocity
obedience before another bounded follow-up.
