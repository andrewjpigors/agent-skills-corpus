# Agent Spec Tool-First Workflow

> **Version:** 3.5.0 | **Last Updated:** 2026-07-07 | **Tracks agent-spec:** 1.0.0 (stability promise)

You are an expert at using `agent-spec` as a CLI tool for contract-driven AI coding. Help users by:
- **Planning**: Render task contracts with `contract`, generate plan context with `plan`
- **Implementing**: Follow contract Intent, Decisions, Boundaries
- **Verifying**: Run `lifecycle` / `guard` to check code against specs
- **Reviewing**: Use `explain` for human-readable summaries, `stamp` for git trailers
- **Debugging**: Interpret verification failures and fix code accordingly

## IMPORTANT: CLI Prerequisite Check

**Before running any `agent-spec` command, Claude MUST check:**

```bash
command -v agent-spec || cargo install agent-spec
```

If `agent-spec` is not installed, inform the user:
> `agent-spec` CLI not found. Install with: `cargo install agent-spec`

## Core Mental Model

**The key shift**: Review point displacement. Human attention moves from "reading code diffs" to "writing contracts".

```
Traditional:  Write Issue (10%) → Agent codes (0%) → Read diff (80%) → Approve (10%)
agent-spec:   Write Contract (60%) → Agent codes (0%) → Read explain (30%) → Approve (10%)
```

Humans define "what is correct" (Contract). Machines verify "is the code correct" (lifecycle). Humans do final "Contract Acceptance" — not Code Review.

## Quick Reference

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `agent-spec init` | Scaffold new spec | Starting a new task |
| `agent-spec contract <spec>` | Render Task Contract | Before coding - read the execution plan |
| `agent-spec lint <files>` | Spec quality check | After writing spec, before giving to Agent |
| `agent-spec plan <spec> --code .` | Generate plan context | Before coding - codebase scan + task sketch |
| `agent-spec lifecycle <spec> --code .` | Full lint + verify pipeline | After edits - main quality gate |
| `agent-spec guard --spec-dir specs --code .` | Repo-wide check | Pre-commit / CI - all specs at once |
| `agent-spec explain <spec> --format markdown` | PR-ready review summary | Contract Acceptance - paste into PR |
| `agent-spec explain <spec> --history` | Execution history | See how many retries the Agent needed |
| `agent-spec stamp <spec> --dry-run` | Preview git trailers | Before committing - traceability |
| `agent-spec graph --spec-dir specs` | Dependency graph (DOT) | After writing specs - visualize deps & critical path |
| `agent-spec requirements graph --gate` | Validate KLL requirements and dependency graph | After importing PRD/issue requirements |
| `agent-spec wiki status` | Check stale code live wiki articles | Session start / before broad source reading |
| `agent-spec wiki query <text>` | Search tracked live wiki articles | Before opening many source files |
| `agent-spec wiki check` | Live wiki lint + worktree status gate | Pre-commit / CI for tracked wiki |
| `agent-spec atlas build/tree/query/refs/impls/check` | Rust project graph (symbols, impls, refs) with hash staleness | Query structure instead of grepping; `--frozen` for read-only |
| `agent-spec verify <spec> --code .` | Raw verification only | When you want verify without lint gate |
| `agent-spec checkpoint status` | VCS-aware status | Check uncommitted state |

## BDD-spine Commands (0.3.0)

agent-spec 0.3.0 absorbs living-spec-library + scaffolding/governance under the
BDD-spine model (Discovery → Formulation → Automation). These six commands are
additive — **verdict semantics and `is_passing` are unchanged**; every new check
is a sensor (lint / report / audit), never a silent change to pass/fail.

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `agent-spec matrix <spec> --code .` | Render the coverage matrix: Rule × Scenario × Test × Verdict × Provenance (`--format text\|json\|markdown`) | See which Rules/Examples are proven by which tests, and whether evidence is Computational vs Inferential |
| `agent-spec promote <spec> --rule <id> --to <cap> --code .` | Promote a passing task Rule into `specs/capabilities/<cap>.spec.md` (living-spec library) | When a task Rule has matured and should be reused across tasks. Gate: the Rule's Examples must pass (≥1 example required); the stable `id` never changes |
| `agent-spec audit --spec-dir specs` | Aggregate spec-library health: counts, unproven rules, ungrouped scenarios, open questions, malformed rules (`--format text\|json`) | Periodic library health snapshot. **Observability only — never gates** |
| `agent-spec discover --from-codebase --code <dir> --name <n> [--out <file>]` | Reverse-engineer a draft task spec from existing test functions (one bound scenario per test + a `## Questions` seed) | Cold-start: a codebase has tests but no spec. The draft is a parseable starting point, NOT a finished contract — refine the seeded Questions |
| `agent-spec check-structure --code <dir> --forbid <substr> --in <glob>` | Mechanical layering guard: forbid a reference within a file glob; non-zero exit on violation | Enforce architecture invariants (e.g. `--forbid crate::services --in clients/**`) in CI |
| `agent-spec gen-integrations [--target agents\|cursor\|claude\|all] [--out <dir>] [--check]` | Generate per-tool integration files from one source; `--check` exits non-zero on drift | Keep agents/cursor/claude integration files in sync from a single source; use `--check` as a CI drift gate |

Notes:
- `matrix` shares `verify`'s change-set flags (`--change`, `--change-scope`, `--ai-mode`) and default semantics.
- `promote` writes to `specs/capabilities/<name>.spec.md`; the capability name is path-traversal-checked.
- `audit` and `check-structure` are mechanical and read-only (no code execution beyond scanning).

## Knowledge & Liveness Layer (0.4.0 KLL)

KLL adds a typed **knowledge layer** beside specs: durable `decision` /
`requirement` / `guidance` / `proposal` artifacts under `knowledge/`, a
`satisfies:` edge from specs back to decisions or requirements, and a **derived
liveness** answer to "is this decision/requirement still guarded by the code?"
— recomputed from current spec verdicts, never stored. A read-only MCP server
serves it all to agents with no RAG. Knowledge lives in `knowledge/`; specs
still live in `specs/`.

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `agent-spec init --workspace` | Scaffold the canonical `knowledge/` tree (decisions/requirements/proposals/guidance/context + canon + `.agent-spec/config.yaml`). Idempotent | Once, to lay down the knowledge workspace beside `specs/` |
| `agent-spec trace <id> [--gate]` | Trace a decision or requirement id to the specs that `satisfy:` it and report **liveness** (honored / violated / unproven / n/a). `--gate` exits 2 on violated, warns on unproven | Check whether a recorded knowledge artifact is still enforced by passing specs; use `--gate` in CI |
| `agent-spec lint-knowledge [--format text\|json\|sarif] [--gate]` | Lint the knowledge corpus: per-doc rules + governance (id-conflict, supersession integrity, stale refs). `--gate` exits 2 on any Error | Governance gate for the knowledge base; `--format sarif` feeds GitHub Code Scanning |
| `agent-spec requirements transition <ID> --to <status>` / `requirements supersede <ID> --by <NEW>` | Explicit human governance transitions (proposed→accepted/rejected, accepted→deprecated, atomic supersession); missing status fails `graph --gate`; `--format json` emits digest-bearing machine output (facts only — no actor/authority fields; external systems bind approvals to digests) | Accept requirements before lowering; compilation never mutates status |
| `agent-spec requirements status <ID>` | Three-axis report: governance / execution / liveness with spec evidence | "Where is REQ-X?" in one command |
| `agent-spec requirements traceability <ID> [--format json\|text] [--out <file>]` | Deterministic projection of one requirement's evidence chain: clauses → satisfying specs → scenarios → bound tests → latest recorded verdicts → derived liveness; a pure read over stored trace records | Feed dashboards/orchestrators one byte-stable JSON document instead of re-deriving the join |
| `agent-spec requirements <graph\|plan\|work-units\|test-obligations\|traceability> --out <f> --provenance <m>.json` | Emit a compilation-run manifest (v2): compiler build commit + effective config + blake3 input/output digests | Record any artifact-emitting compilation as reproducible, auditable work |
| `agent-spec requirements verify-run --manifest <m>.json` | Replay the recorded compilation in memory and byte-compare against recorded digests; non-zero exit names every drifted output | Prove a recorded compilation still reproduces — determinism as an executable check |
| `agent-spec requirements compile --out <dir> [--id REQ-*] [--layout agent-spec-v1\|arc-v1] [--force]` | Per-requirement bundles (requirement doc + draft spec + traceability + compilation manifest with bundle digest); atomic writes, overwrite refusal without `--force`; `arc-v1` projects reference-compatible file names over the same content | Hand orchestrators/consumers a pinned, replayable bundle; covers accepted requirements whose work unit is ready (cold-start compile path) |
| `agent-spec requirements bind [--code .] [--graph .agent-spec/graph] [--out .agent-spec/code-bindings.json]` | Bind ready work units' declared `### Symbols` to code targets resolved in the provider graph (rust-atlas first); stale graph fails naming lagging files; bindings are derived working data, never KLL truth | Ground work units in real symbols before contract finalization (boundary 2 of the target architecture) |
| Contract `### Symbols` (`- rust-atlas: <path>`) | Lifecycle validates every declared symbol against a fresh graph: `atlas-symbol-missing` / `atlas-stale` (stale wins, no false positives); valid = silent; no symbols = no graph needed. Passing runs persist typed code targets (provider/node/kind/file/provenance/fingerprint) into trace evidence | Pin a contract to real code symbols; the Linker turns "the symbol no longer exists" into a mechanical diagnostic |
| `agent-spec requirements bundle --unit WU-REQ-X --out bundle.json` | One complete execution context: work unit + embedded contracts (digested) + code bindings + quality profile (argv arrays, normalized outcomes — required-unavailable never passes) + skill receipts (provenance, not acceptance) + fast checks + acceptance gates | Hand an agent everything it needs for one work unit in a single pinnable artifact (boundary 4) |
| `agent-spec requirements export --out requirements.yaml` | YAML projection of confirmed requirements (round-trip fixpoint, `--check` drift gate) | Interop with YAML-world tooling; derived, never source of truth |
| `agent-spec requirements import/graph/work-units/draft-specs` | Convert marked PRD/issue requirement blocks into KLL artifacts, validate the graph, generate executable work units, and draft Task Contracts with `satisfies: [REQ-*]` | Use when raw product requirements need to become verifiable agent-spec work |
| `agent-spec mcp` | Serve the knowledge layer over MCP (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio, read-only, deterministic) | Wire into an MCP client so agents query knowledge live |
| `agent-spec gen-integrations --with-guidance <knowledge>` | Project `guidance/` artifacts into the generated CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/.cursorrules | Push stack/path-scoped guidance into agent tool config |

Requirements intake flow:

```bash
agent-spec requirements import --from docs/prd.md --out knowledge/requirements
agent-spec requirements import --from requirements.yaml --out knowledge/requirements
agent-spec lint-knowledge --knowledge knowledge --gate
agent-spec requirements graph --knowledge knowledge --format json --gate
agent-spec requirements work-units --knowledge knowledge --out .agent-spec/work_units.json
agent-spec requirements draft-specs --knowledge knowledge --out specs/generated
```

`requirements import` reads explicit `<!-- agent-spec:requirement ... -->`
Markdown blocks, or the constrained YAML dialect for `.yaml`/`.yml` sources
(`docs/intent-compiler/yaml-frontend-v1.md`); it never interprets raw prose. Marked blocks need
blocks with `id` and `title`. Generated Task Contract drafts are review
artifacts: they carry `satisfies: [REQ-*]` and placeholder `pending_...` test
selectors, so `lifecycle` is expected to fail until a human binds real tests.

### `docs/` vs `knowledge/`

Use `docs/` for human-facing explanatory material: PRDs, issue writeups, design
notes, plans, retrospectives, tutorials, and background context. `docs/` files
do not need stable IDs or KLL frontmatter, and `trace`, `lint-knowledge`, and
`requirements graph` do not treat them as governed truth.

Use `knowledge/` for machine-consumable project truth: durable decisions,
requirements, guidance, and proposals with typed frontmatter (`kind`, `id`,
`title` when required, `liveness`) and lintable sections. Specs connect to
these artifacts with `satisfies: [ADR-*|REQ-*]`; `trace` can then answer whether
code still guards them.

Pipeline rule: raw PRD/issue material may start in `docs/`, but executable
work must be derived from imported `knowledge/requirements/*.md`, not directly
from raw prose. Exception: `knowledge/context/` is a free-form KLL escape hatch
served by MCP, but it is untyped, unlinted, and not trace-gated.

The six MCP tools (deterministic, no RAG): `knowledge.find`,
`knowledge.governing` (decisions guarding a path via satisfying-spec
boundaries + live liveness), `liveness.status`, `spec.contract`,
`guidance.for`, `context.read`.

Liveness ladder (precedence, total): declared `n/a` → `na`; any satisfying
spec `Fail` → `violated`; none or any not-`Pass` → `unproven`; all `Pass` →
`honored`. Liveness is **never stored** — always recomputed.

## Code Live Wiki

Use the wiki commands to maintain a repo-local code live wiki from raw source,
KLL artifacts, Task Contracts, docs, archive summaries, and lifecycle trace
evidence. The default path is `.agent-spec/wiki`.

```bash
agent-spec wiki init --code . --wiki .agent-spec/wiki
agent-spec wiki seed --code . --wiki .agent-spec/wiki
agent-spec wiki seed --code . --wiki .agent-spec/wiki --check
agent-spec wiki status --code . --wiki .agent-spec/wiki
agent-spec wiki query "intent compiler" --wiki .agent-spec/wiki
agent-spec wiki inspect src/spec_wiki/live.rs --code . --wiki .agent-spec/wiki
agent-spec wiki inventory --code . --format json
agent-spec wiki inventory --code . --format mermaid
agent-spec wiki index --wiki .agent-spec/wiki
agent-spec wiki lint --code . --wiki .agent-spec/wiki
agent-spec wiki check --code . --wiki .agent-spec/wiki
agent-spec wiki meta update --code . --wiki .agent-spec/wiki
```

Wiki pages are tracked agent working memory under `.agent-spec/wiki/**`, not
KLL truth and not published docs. Every maintained article must declare
`source_files`. Keep `.agent-spec/runs`, `.agent-spec/trace`, temp files, and
other runtime state ignored. Use `wiki status` to find stale articles, `wiki
query` before broad source reading, and `wiki inspect <path>` to
locate related wiki pages, KLL requirements, and task specs. `wiki seed` creates
draft module/concept/decision pages without overwriting maintained articles.
`wiki inventory` emits Rust architecture inventory and module graphs when Cargo
metadata is available.
`wiki check` combines index freshness, lint, and current worktree stale status.
In CI clean checkouts it is the tracked wiki structure gate. Old article
content should move into `learnings/` or `archive/`
summaries with source links rather than being deleted abruptly. Non-goals:
no built-in LLM long-form wiki generation, no web UI, and no replacement for
`knowledge/`.

## Documentation

Refer to the local files for detailed command patterns:
- `./references/commands.md` - Complete CLI command reference with all flags

## IMPORTANT: Documentation Completeness Check

**Before answering questions, Claude MUST:**
1. Read `./references/commands.md` for exact command syntax
2. If file read fails: Inform user "references/commands.md is missing, answering from SKILL.md patterns"
3. Still answer based on SKILL.md patterns + built-in knowledge

## The Seven-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Human writes Task Contract (human attention: 60%)

Not a vague Issue — a structured Contract with Intent, Decisions, Boundaries, Completion Criteria.

```bash
agent-spec init --level task --lang zh --name "用户注册API"
# Then fill in the four elements in the generated .spec.md file
```

For rewrite, migration, or parity tasks, prefer the parity-aware scaffold:

```bash
agent-spec init --level task --template rewrite-parity --lang en --name "CLI Parity Contract"
```

**Key principle**: Exception scenarios >= happy path scenarios. 1 happy + 3 error paths forces you to think through edge cases before coding begins.

### Step 2: Contract quality gate

Check Contract quality before handing to Agent. Like "code review" but for the Contract itself.

```bash
agent-spec parse specs/user-registration.spec
agent-spec lint specs/user-registration.spec --min-score 0.7
```

Catches: malformed structure, zero-scenario acceptance sections, vague verbs, unquantified constraints, non-deterministic wording, missing test selectors, sycophancy bias, uncovered constraints, uncovered decisions (decision-coverage), unbound observable behavior decisions (observable-decision-coverage), uncovered output modes (output-mode-coverage), unverified precedence/fallback chains (precedence-fallback-coverage), weak mock-only I/O error scenarios (external-io-error-strength), missing verification-strength metadata on I/O scenarios (verification-metadata-suggestion), missing error paths (error-path), universal claims with insufficient scenarios (universal-claim), boundary entry points without matching scenarios (boundary-entry-point), untested flag combinations (flag-combination-coverage), untagged platform-specific decisions (platform-decision-tag).

**Required self-checks before coding:**
- `agent-spec parse` must show the expected section count and a non-zero scenario count for task specs.
- If `Acceptance Criteria: 0 scenarios` appears, stop and rewrite the spec before running `contract` or `lifecycle`.
- The parser accepts Markdown-heading forms like `### Scenario:` and `### Test:` for compatibility, but authoring should still emit bare `Scenario:` / `场景:` and `Test:` / `测试:` lines by default. Do not invent extra top-level sections like `## Milestones`.

**Unbound Observable Behavior review:**
- After `parse + lint`, ask which stdout, stderr, file, network, cache, and persisted-state behaviors are still unbound.
- If the task is a rewrite, migration, or parity effort, also ask whether the contract covers:
  - command x output mode
  - local x remote
  - warm cache x cold start
  - fallback / precedence order
  - partial failure vs hard failure
- If any of these surfaces are still only described in prose, switch back to authoring mode and add scenarios before coding.

Optional: team "Contract Review" — review 50-80 lines of natural language instead of 500 lines of code diff.

### Step 3: Agent reads Contract, generates plan, and codes

Agent consumes the structured contract and generates plan context:

```bash
# Read the contract
agent-spec contract specs/user-registration.spec

# Generate plan context with codebase scan
agent-spec plan specs/user-registration.spec --code . --format prompt
```

The `plan` command outputs three blocks:
- **Contract** — the full task contract (same as `contract` command)
- **Codebase Context** — files in Allowed Changes paths with summaries, pub signatures, and test function names
- **Task Sketch** — scenarios grouped by dependency order for implementation sequencing

Use `--format prompt` to get a self-contained prompt for AI plan generation. Use `--depth full` to include pub API signatures.

Agent is triple-constrained:
- **Decisions** tell it "how to do it" (no technology shopping)
- **Boundaries** tell it "what to touch" (no unauthorized file changes)
- **Completion Criteria** tell it "when it's done" (all bound tests must pass)

### Step 4: Agent self-checks with lifecycle (automatic retry loop)

```bash
agent-spec lifecycle specs/user-registration.spec \
  --code . --change-scope worktree --format json --run-log-dir .agent-spec/runs
```

Four verification layers run in sequence:
1. **lint** — re-check Contract quality (prevent spec tampering)
2. **StructuralVerifier** — pattern match Must NOT constraints against code
3. **BoundariesVerifier** — check changed files are within Allowed Changes
4. **TestVerifier** — execute tests bound to each scenario

```
Agent retry loop (no human needed):
  Code → lifecycle → FAIL (2/5) → read failure_summary → fix → lifecycle → FAIL (4/5) → fix → lifecycle → PASS (5/5) ✓
```

Run logs record this history — "this Contract took 3 tries to pass".

#### The Iron Law

```
NO CODE IS "DONE" WITHOUT A PASSING LIFECYCLE
```

If lifecycle hasn't run in this session, you cannot claim completion. If lifecycle ran but had failures, code is not done. No exceptions.

#### Retry Protocol

When lifecycle fails, follow this exact sequence:

1. Run: `agent-spec lifecycle <spec> --code . --format json`
2. Parse JSON output, find each scenario's `verdict` and `evidence`
3. For `fail`: the bound test ran and failed — read evidence to understand why, fix code
4. For `skip`: the bound test was not found — check `Test:` selector matches a real test name
5. For `uncertain`: AI verification pending — review manually or enable AI backend
6. **Fix code based on evidence. Do NOT modify the spec file** — changing the Contract to make verification pass is sycophancy, not a fix
7. Re-run lifecycle
8. After 3 consecutive failures on the same scenario, stop and escalate to the human

#### Red Flags — Stop If You're Thinking This

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "lifecycle is slow, skip it this once" | Skipping verification = delivering unverified code |
| "I only changed one line, no need to re-run" | One line can break every scenario |
| "skip means it's fine" | skip ≠ pass. skip = not verified |
| "The spec is too strict, let me adjust it" | Changing spec to pass isn't fixing — it's weakening the contract |
| "3 failures already, just submit what I have" | 3 failures → stop and escalate to human |
| "I ran lifecycle earlier, it should still pass" | "Should" is not evidence. Run it again. |
| "The test is flaky, not my code" | Prove it: run 3 times. If 2+ pass, investigate flake. If 0-1 pass, it's your code. |

**Critical rule**: The spec defines "what is correct". If the code doesn't match, fix the code. If the spec itself is wrong, switch to authoring mode and update the Contract explicitly — never silently weaken acceptance criteria.

### Step 5: Guard gate (pre-commit / CI)

```bash
# Pre-commit hook
agent-spec guard --spec-dir specs --code . --change-scope staged

# CI (GitHub Actions)
agent-spec guard --spec-dir specs --code . --change-scope worktree
```

Runs lint + verify on ALL specs against current changes. Blocks commit/PR if any spec fails.

### Step 6: Contract Acceptance replaces Code Review (human attention: 30%)

Human reviews a Contract-level summary, not a code diff:

```bash
agent-spec explain specs/user-registration.spec --code . --format markdown
```

Reviewer judges two questions:
1. **Is the Contract definition correct?** (Intent, Decisions, Boundaries make sense?)
2. **Did all verifications pass?** (4/4 pass including error paths?)

**Evidence gate**: Before presenting results to the reviewer, run `agent-spec explain <spec> --format markdown` fresh. Read the output. Confirm all verdicts are `pass`. Do NOT report results from memory — run the command and read the output in this session.

If both "yes" → approve. This is 10x faster than reading code diffs.

Check retry history if needed:

```bash
agent-spec explain specs/user-registration.spec --code . --history
```

#### Assisting Contract Acceptance

When helping a human review a completed task:

1. Run `agent-spec explain <spec> --code . --format markdown` and present the output
2. If human asks about retry history: run with `--history` flag
3. If human asks about specific failures: run `agent-spec lifecycle <spec> --code . --format json` and extract the relevant scenario results
4. If human approves: run `agent-spec stamp <spec> --code . --dry-run` and present the trailers

### Step 7: Stamp and archive

```bash
agent-spec stamp specs/user-registration.spec --dry-run
# Output: Spec-Name: 用户注册API
#         Spec-Passing: true
#         Spec-Summary: 4/4 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 uncertain
```

Establishes Contract → Commit traceability chain.

## Verdict Interpretation

| Verdict | Meaning | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `pass` | Scenario verified | No action needed |
| `fail` | Scenario failed verification | Read evidence, fix code |
| `skip` | Test not found or not run | Add missing test or fix selector |
| `uncertain` | AI stub / manual review needed | Review manually or enable AI backend |

**Key rule: `skip` != `pass`**. All five verdicts (`pass`, `fail`, `skip`, `uncertain`, `pending_review`) are distinct.

## VCS Awareness

agent-spec auto-detects the VCS from the project root. Behavior differs between git and jj:

| Condition | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `.jj/` exists (even with `.git/`) | Use `--change-scope jj` instead of `worktree` |
| jj repo | Do NOT run `git add` or `git commit` — jj auto-snapshots all changes |
| jj repo | `stamp` output includes `Spec-Change:` trailer with jj change ID |
| jj repo | `explain --history` shows file-level diffs between runs (via operation IDs) |
| Only `.git/` | Use standard git commands (`--change-scope staged` or `worktree`) |
| Neither | Change scope detection unavailable; use `--change <path>` explicitly |

## Change Set Options

| Flag | Behavior | Default |
|------|----------|---------|
| `--change <path>` | Explicit file/dir for boundary checking | (none) |
| `--change-scope staged` | Git staged files | guard default |
| `--change-scope worktree` | All git working tree changes | (none) |
| `--change-scope jj` | Jujutsu VCS changes | (none) |
| `--change-scope none` | No change detection | lifecycle/verify default |

## Advanced Features

### Verification Layers

```bash
# Run only specific layers
agent-spec lifecycle specs/task.spec --code . --layers lint,boundary,test
# Available: lint, boundary, test, ai
```

### Run Logging

```bash
agent-spec lifecycle specs/task.spec --code . --run-log-dir .agent-spec/runs
agent-spec explain specs/task.spec --history
```

### AI Mode

```bash
agent-spec verify specs/task.spec --code . --ai-mode off      # default - no AI
agent-spec verify specs/task.spec --code . --ai-mode stub      # testing only
agent-spec lifecycle specs/task.spec --code . --ai-mode caller # agent-as-verifier
```

### AI Verification: Caller Mode

When `--ai-mode caller` is used, the calling Agent acts as the AI verifier. This is a two-step protocol:

**Step 1: Emit AI requests**

```bash
agent-spec lifecycle specs/task.spec --code . --ai-mode caller --format json
```

If any scenarios are skipped (no mechanical verifier covered them), the output JSON includes:
- `"ai_pending": true`
- `"ai_requests_file": ".agent-spec/pending-ai-requests.json"`

The pending requests file contains `AiRequest` objects with scenario context, code paths, contract intent, and constraints.

**Step 2: Resolve with external decisions**

The Agent reads the pending requests, analyzes each scenario, then writes decisions:

```json
[
  {
    "scenario_name": "场景名称",
    "model": "claude-agent",
    "confidence": 0.92,
    "verdict": "pass",
    "reasoning": "All steps verified by code analysis"
  }
]
```

Then merges them back:

```bash
agent-spec resolve-ai specs/task.spec --code . --decisions decisions.json
```

This produces a final merged report where Skip verdicts are replaced with the Agent's AI decisions.

**When to use caller mode:**
- When the calling Agent (Claude, Codex, etc.) can read and reason about code
- For scenarios that can't be verified by tests alone (design intent, code quality)
- When you want the Agent to be both implementor and verifier

## Best Practices

1. **Self-bootstrap**: Write specs first, lint them, then implement against them. The spec defines correctness before code exists.

2. **Bind every scenario to a test**: Every scenario needs a `Test:` / `测试:` selector. Without it, TestVerifier skips the scenario and reports `skip` — not `pass`.

3. **Tag critical scenarios**: Add `标签: critical` / `Tags: critical` to must-pass scenarios. Critical failures set `gate_blocked=true` and exit code 2, making them CI-friendly gates.

4. **Use the dependency graph for planning**: Add `depends` and `estimate` to spec frontmatter, then run `agent-spec graph --spec-dir specs` to visualize the DAG and critical path before starting work.

5. **Layered verification**: Use `--layers` to run only what you need. During early development: `--layers boundary,test`. For CI: full `lifecycle`. For quick checks: `--layers lint`.

6. **Use text for humans, JSON for agents**: `--format json` gives machine-parseable output for retry loops; the default text format is human-readable. (Note: `lifecycle`/`verify` only honor `json` and `md`/`markdown` — other values, including `compact`/`diagnostic`, render as plain text.)

7. **Aim for decision coverage**: Every Decision in the spec should be exercised by at least one scenario. The `decision-coverage` linter catches orphaned decisions.

8. **Define precise boundaries**: Use path globs (`crates/foo/**`) for mechanical enforcement. Natural language prohibitions are lint-checked but not file-path enforced. Use both.

9. **Use incremental resume for long specs**: `--resume` skips already-passed scenarios. `--resume=conservative` reruns all but detects regressions. Saves time on specs with 10+ scenarios.

10. **Split roadmaps into small specs**: Each spec should have 3-8 scenarios. If you need more, split into multiple specs with `depends` relationships. Use `agent-spec graph` to visualize.

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

| Scenario | Use agent-spec? | Why |
|----------|----------------|-----|
| Clear feature with defined inputs/outputs | Yes | Contract can express deterministic acceptance criteria |
| Bug fix with reproducible steps | Yes | Great for "given bug X, when fixed, then Y" |
| Exploratory prototyping | No | You don't know "what is done" yet - vibe code first |
| Large architecture refactor | No | Boundaries hard to define, "better architecture" isn't testable |
| Security/compliance rules | Yes (org.spec) | Encode rules once, enforce mechanically everywhere |

### Gradual Adoption

```
Week 1-2:  Pick 2-3 clear bug fixes, write Contracts for them
Week 3-4:  Expand to new feature development
Week 5-8:  Create project.spec with team coding standards
Month 3+:  Consider org.spec for cross-project governance
```

## Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Guard reports N specs failing | Specs have lint or verify issues | Run `lifecycle` on each failing spec individually |
| `skip` verdict on scenario | Test selector doesn't match any test | Check `Test:` / `Package:` / `Filter:` in spec |
| Quality score below threshold | Too many lint warnings | Fix vague verbs, add quantifiers, improve testability |
| Boundary violation detected | Changed file outside allowed paths | Either update Boundaries or revert the change |
| `uncertain` on all AI scenarios | Using `--ai-mode stub` or no backend | Expected — review manually |
| Agent keeps failing lifecycle | Contract criteria too vague or too strict | Improve Completion Criteria specificity |

## Command Priority

| Preference | Use | Instead of |
|------------|-----|------------|
| `contract` | Render task contract | `brief` (removed in 1.0) |
| `plan` | Contract + codebase + sketch | Manual code exploration |
| `lifecycle` | Full pipeline | `verify` alone (misses lint) |
| `guard` | Repo-wide | Multiple individual `lifecycle` calls |
| `--change` | Explicit paths known | `--change-scope` when paths are known |
| CLI commands | Tool-first approach | `spec-gateway` library API |

## When to Switch to Authoring Mode

During implementation, if you discover:
- A missing exception path that should be in Completion Criteria
- A Boundary that's too restrictive (need to modify more files than allowed)
- A Decision that needs to change (technology choice was wrong)

Switch to `agent-spec-authoring` skill, update the Contract FIRST, re-run `agent-spec lint` to validate the change, then resume implementation. Do NOT silently work outside the Contract's boundaries.

## Escalation

Switch to library integration only when:
- Embedding `agent-spec` into another Rust agent runtime
- Testing `spec-gateway` internals
- Injecting a host `AiBackend` via `verify_with_backend(Arc<dyn AiBackend>)`

## Intent Compiler

Intent Compiler loop:

1. Keep raw PRD/issue text in `docs/`.
2. Convert stable requirements into `knowledge/requirements/*.md`.
3. Run `agent-spec lint-knowledge --knowledge knowledge --gate`.
4. Run `agent-spec requirements plan --knowledge knowledge --specs specs --format json --gate`.
5. Run `agent-spec requirements test-obligations --knowledge knowledge --specs specs --format json --out .agent-spec/test_obligations.json`.
6. Run `agent-spec requirements worktrees --knowledge knowledge --specs specs --base main --path-prefix ../agent-spec-worktrees --out .agent-spec/worktrees.json`.
7. Run `agent-spec requirements replay REQ-*`, `requirements explain-failure REQ-*`, or `requirements trace-graph REQ-*` when debugging requirement liveness.
8. Run `agent-spec requirements questions --knowledge knowledge --specs specs --format json`.
9. Use the reverse interview skill only to resolve emitted questions.
10. Generate or refine task specs with `satisfies: [REQ-*]`.
11. Run `agent-spec lifecycle`, `agent-spec guard`, and `agent-spec trace REQ-*`.
12. For agent-spec's own development, dogfood this loop on the repository's own KLL requirement and task spec before treating example fixtures as validation.
13. After contract acceptance, run `agent-spec archive --run-log-dir . --dry-run` to prepare a compressed historical summary for completed specs whose latest lifecycle evidence matches the current spec path and content fingerprint and is still passing.

The CLI is deterministic and model-free. AI may draft candidate KLL artifacts and ask clarification questions, but it does not replace KLL lint, plan gate, lifecycle, or human acceptance.
The test-obligations manifest is the DORA Stream-D bridge: tests are derived from requirements/specs instead of code. QA class and state-machine lint keep high-risk lifecycle/protocol work from relying only on prose review.
The worktree manifest is a scheduling artifact. It does not run `git worktree add`; it tells humans or orchestration tools which ready work units can safely map to branches and directories.
The requirement trace ledger is a debugging and audit surface. It reports the latest stored evidence chain and marks unknown code targets explicitly instead of guessing.
Example fixtures are demonstrations. The dogfood proof for agent-spec itself is the self-hosting KLL requirement, task spec, lifecycle evidence, replay, and trace graph in this repository.
Archived specs are not active contracts by default. Archive requires a `done` or `completed` tag plus latest passing lifecycle evidence bound to the current spec path and content fingerprint; missing, failing, or stale evidence is reported as an archive diagnostic. Keep active specs small enough for `guard`, `trace`, and `requirements plan` to remain useful.

### Documentation Engineering

For human-facing docs, use Lore-style doc types, canon, and operational review checklists. Run `bash scripts/docs-lint.sh` as a pre-publish check; it uses Harper for English prose when installed, always runs agent-spec's built-in Chinese docs lint, and also runs markdownlint and lychee when installed. Keep reader-facing prose in `docs/` and machine-consumable truth in `knowledge/`. Docs gates check structure, style, rendered preview, and links; KLL/spec gates check traceability and behavior.
