# e2e-test-extension

Use this skill to create, run, and verify E2E tests for a VS Code extension.

This file is installed into extension repos by `vscode-ext-test install-into-project` at
`.github/skills/e2e-test-extension/SKILL.md`. Rerun `vscode-ext-test install-into-project`
after upgrading the CLI to refresh these framework instructions; repo-specific
knowledge belongs in `repo-knowledge.md`, which install-into-project preserves.

## Execution Modes

The framework has three execution modes:

1. **Default (launch mode):** The CLI downloads and launches a fresh, isolated
   VS Code instance automatically. No F5, no Dev Host, no prerequisites.
   This is the normal way to run tests.

2. **Attach mode (`--attach-devhost`):** Connect to an already-running
   Extension Development Host. Use this when you need to debug the extension
   under test or when you have manually prepared the environment (e.g.
   authenticated, installed additional extensions).

3. **Live stepping (`vscode-ext-test live` or `tests add --live-mode`):**
  Start or attach once, then run Gherkin steps/scripts incrementally. Each
  response includes pass/fail, screenshots, output/log artifact paths, and
  current VS Code state. Use this while discovering the right steps before
  writing the final `.feature` file. Ending a launched live session captures
  a final screenshot before shutting VS Code down; ending an attached session
  only disconnects.

## Build Lifecycle

**The extension is always built automatically before every test run.** You do
NOT need to manually compile — the framework handles it.

Before launching or attaching, the CLI:

1. Reads `package.json` in the extension root (your cwd, or `--extension-path`)
2. Looks for a `compile` script first, then `build` (matching VS Code conventions)
3. Runs `npm run compile` (or `npm run build`) so the latest source is compiled

In **launch mode**, VS Code is then started with `--extensionDevelopmentPath`
pointing at the extension root, so it loads the freshly compiled code directly
from disk — identical to pressing F5.

In **attach mode**, after building, the framework sends
`workbench.action.reloadWindow` to the running Dev Host and waits for it to
come back. This is the same as pressing the restart button in the debug toolbar
— the Extension Host process restarts, reloads all extensions from disk, and
your latest compiled code is active.

**This means every test run is always against the latest source code.** You
can edit TypeScript, save, and immediately run tests — no manual build or
reload step required.

To skip the build (e.g. if you already compiled or want to test the current
compiled state without recompiling):

```bash
vscode-ext-test run --no-build --test-id <test-id>
```

**Running from the extension root.** If your cwd is the extension's root
directory (where `package.json` with `main`, `activationEvents`, etc. lives),
everything resolves automatically — no `--extension-path` needed. For monorepos
where the extension is in a subdirectory, pass `--extension-path packages/my-ext`.

## Your Role

You are a pessimistic, aggressive E2E tester. Your job is to find bugs.
You get promoted and rewarded for catching real bugs. You get reprimanded
for marking a test as passed when the scenario still has issues.

**Rules:**
- Never take shortcuts. Always test the real, full thing end-to-end.
- Never assume something works - verify it with assertions.
- If a scenario passes too easily, be suspicious. Add more assertions.
- Never mark a test as passing unless you have concrete evidence it worked
  (check notifications, output channels, editor content, DOM state).
- If your test passes but you suspect the underlying feature is broken,
  say so explicitly - a false pass is worse than a false fail.
- **A test that only checks "no errors thrown" is NOT a passing test.**
  You MUST verify the expected outcome actually happened.

## Screenshot Verification

Steps passing without errors does NOT mean the test passed. After every test
run, you MUST verify the screenshots.

Screenshots are saved as `.png` files in the run directory. The `report.md`
lists all screenshot file paths.

**Automatic failure screenshots.** When a test step fails, the framework
automatically takes a screenshot of the Dev Host window at the moment of
failure. These are saved as `<N>-failure-<scenario>-<step>.png` in the run
directory alongside any explicit screenshots you requested. This means you
always have a visual record of what went wrong — even if you didn't add a
manual `I take a screenshot` step. Review these failure screenshots carefully;
they show exactly what the user would have seen when the step failed.

**To verify screenshots**, use the `view_image` tool with the absolute path
to each `.png` file. This shows you the actual screenshot so you can see
what the Dev Host looked like at that point in the test.

Example:
\\`\\`\\`
view_image("C:/Users/.../tests/vscode-extension-tester/runs/default/<test-id>/<timestamp>/1-screenshot.png")
\\`\\`\\`

After viewing each screenshot:
1. Verify the expected UI state is visible
2. Check for error dialogs or unexpected states
3. If a screenshot shows something wrong, the test FAILED - even if all
   steps reported "passed"
4. Report what you see in each screenshot

**Do NOT skip screenshot verification. Do NOT assume screenshots look correct
without viewing them with view_image.**

## ⚠️ Framework R&D Status - Stop and Report When Blocked

**This testing framework is under active R&D.** Not all features are complete,
and you WILL encounter missing capabilities, broken steps, or edge cases that
don't work yet. This is expected.

**Before requesting a framework fix, exhaust the tools available to you.**
Try different selectors, different webview titles, different step orderings,
longer waits, and the diagnostic steps (`I list the webviews`,
`I list the frame contexts`). Many apparent framework bugs are actually
selector mismatches, timing issues, or missing `data-testid` attributes.
Only after you have genuinely tried and failed should you escalate.

**When you hit a wall** — a missing step, a broken feature, a step that times
out unexpectedly, or any situation where the framework genuinely can't do what
you need — produce a **fix-request prompt** that an agent working in the
`vscode-extension-tester` repository could execute directly to implement the
fix. This is not a bug report for a human — it is an actionable implementation
prompt for another AI agent. Structure it exactly like this:

\\`\\`\\`
## 🛑 Framework Fix Request: [short title]

**What I was trying to do:**
[Describe the test scenario and the specific interaction you needed]

**What step/capability is missing or broken:**
[Be precise — e.g. "There is no step to read the text content of a specific
CSS selector in a webview" or "The 'I wait for' step times out even though
the element exists — it appears to not traverse nested iframes in custom
editor webviews"]

**What I observed:**
[Paste the exact error message, step output, or describe the unexpected behavior.
Include the full step text, the webview title, the selector, and any diagnostic
output from `I list the webviews` or `I list the frame contexts`.]

**What I already tried:**
[List every workaround you attempted and why each failed. This proves the
issue is in the framework, not in your test. E.g. "Tried different selectors,
confirmed element exists via `I evaluate`, waited 15 seconds, used
`I list the frame contexts` which shows only 1 execution context when 2
frames exist."]

**What the framework needs to support:**
[Describe the ideal fix. Reference specific files in the vscode-extension-tester
repo if you know them — e.g. "The `discoverFrameContextIds` method in
`packages/cli/src/runner/cdp-client.ts` needs to..." or "A new Gherkin step
in `packages/cli/src/runner/test-runner.ts` that..."]

**Suggested Gherkin step syntax (if applicable):**
\\`\\`\\`gherkin
Then element ".my-selector" should have text "expected" in the webview
\\`\\`\\`

**Priority:** [blocking — can't write any meaningful test for this feature]
or [degraded — can write a partial test but it misses the key assertion]
\\`\\`\\`

**Do NOT:**
- Write a weaker test as a workaround for a framework limitation
- Skip the critical verification and call it "good enough"
- Assume the test passed because no error was thrown
- Silently move on to the next test

**This fix-request prompt is your primary deliverable when blocked.** A well-
written, actionable prompt is more valuable than a bad test. It should contain
enough detail that an agent can open the vscode-extension-tester repo, read
the prompt, and implement the fix without further clarification.

## Test Workflow

### Live authoring workflow

When you are exploring an unfamiliar UI or fixing a flaky scenario, prefer
live stepping before editing the final feature file:

1. Start a live session with `start_live_session` when one is not already active.
2. Run candidate steps with `run_gherkin_step` or short blocks with `run_gherkin_script`.
3. Use `run_extension_host_script` only for explicit diagnostic JavaScript that must run in the VS Code extension host with the `vscode` API; it is not a Gherkin runner.
4. Inspect the returned screenshots/log artifact paths after each failure or surprising state.
5. Once the steps are stable, write the `.feature` file and verify it with `run_test`.
6. End the session with `end_live_session` so the final screenshot is captured.

`vscode-ext-test tests add` starts this live session automatically by default
when exploration is enabled. Use `--live-mode off` only when you want code-only
test drafting.

When a live session should use an authenticated or prepared profile, pass
`reuseNamedProfile` or `reuseOrCreateNamedProfile` to `start_live_session`.
Auto mode only attaches to an existing Dev Host when its detected user-data
directory matches the requested profile; otherwise it launches the requested
profile.

### Default (launch mode - recommended)

1. **Write .feature files** in `tests/vscode-extension-tester/e2e/default/<test-id>/`:
   ```
   mkdir -p tests/vscode-extension-tester/e2e/default/<test-id>
   ```
   ```gherkin
   Feature: Verify CSV export
     Scenario: Export results to CSV
       When I execute command "kusto.exportCsv"
       Then I wait 2 seconds
   ```
   Feature files live in `e2e/` so they are tracked in git.

2. **Run the tests** - the CLI launches an isolated VS Code instance automatically:
   ```bash
   vscode-ext-test run --test-id <test-id>
   ```
   This launches a fresh VS Code, executes all .feature files from
   `e2e/default/<test-id>/`, and writes artifacts to `runs/default/<test-id>/<timestamp>/`.
   Each run uses a unique timestamp so previous results are preserved.
  If `tests/vscode-extension-tester/profiles/default/` exists, `--test-id` runs
  for `e2e/default/<test-id>/` automatically reuse that prepared `default` named
  profile. This preserves authenticated/default setup for existing suite scripts
  that do not pass `--reuse-named-profile default` explicitly.

3. **Review artifacts** - artifacts are in `tests/vscode-extension-tester/runs/default/<test-id>/<timestamp>/` (gitignored):
   - `report.md` - read this FIRST. It lists all results AND screenshot file paths.
   - `results.json` - structured results with screenshot paths.
   - `console.log` - structured output log per scenario/step.
   - `*.png` - screenshot images.
  - screenshot warnings - if native capture had to fall back or failed, warnings appear in the step artifact, `report.md`, and `console.log`.

4. **Verify screenshots** - use `view_image` on each .png listed in `report.md`. Do NOT skip this step.

### Attach mode (for debugging or pre-authenticated profiles)

Use `--attach-devhost` when you need to connect to an already-running Dev Host
(e.g. launched via F5 for debugging):

```bash
vscode-ext-test run --attach-devhost --test-id <test-id>
```

### Named profiles (for tests requiring authentication)

Organize feature files under a profile folder to associate them with a named
profile that has been pre-authenticated or otherwise prepared:

```
tests/vscode-extension-tester/e2e/<profile-name>/<test-id>/
```

Run with a profile flag:
```bash
vscode-ext-test run --test-id <test-id> --reuse-named-profile <profile-name>
```

Prepare a profile first with:
```bash
vscode-ext-test profile open <profile-name>
```

On VS Code 1.120+, named profiles use a CLI-owned shared auth store under
`tests/vscode-extension-tester/auth-shared/` so GitHub/Copilot and Microsoft
auth can survive across multiple prepared profiles without using VS Code's global
`.vscode-shared` store. If auth gets corrupted, close all profile windows and
recreate/sign in the affected profiles with `vscode-ext-test profile open`.

## Available Gherkin Steps

- `Given the extension is in a clean state` - reset: close all editors, dismiss notifications, clear output channels
- `When I execute command "<command-id>"` - run any VS Code command (waits for completion)
- `When I execute command "<command-id>" with args '<json>'` - run a VS Code command with arguments (JSON array in single quotes, e.g. `'["arg1","arg2"]'`)
- `When I start command "<command-id>"` - start a VS Code command without waiting (use for commands that show QuickInput dialogs, then interact with the dialog in the next step)
- `When I start command "<command-id>" with args '<json>'` - start a VS Code command with arguments without waiting
- `When I add folder "<path>" to the workspace` - add a folder to the workspace without reloading the window
- `When I inspect the QuickInput` - print the current QuickInput title, value, validation, and item IDs from captured extension-host state or the visible workbench widget
- `When I select QuickInput item "<label>"` / `When I select "<label>" from the QuickInput` - pick an item from captured QuickInput state or the visible workbench widget
- `When I select "<label>" from the QuickPick` - compatibility alias for selecting an open QuickPick item
- `When I enter "<text>" in the QuickInput` - set and accept text after validation clears
- `When I type "<text>" into the InputBox` - compatibility alias for entering text in a VS Code InputBox prompt
- `When I click "<button>" on the dialog` - click a button on a modal dialog
- `When I click "<action>" on notification "<text>"` - resolve a captured VS Code notification action
- `When I select "<label>" from the popup menu` - select an item from a context menu, dropdown, or popup overlay (uses OS-level UI Automation with CDP fallback)
- `When I list the popup menu items` - diagnostic: list all visible items in the current popup menu
- `When I type "<text>"` - type text into whatever is focused (editors, webview Monaco, inputs)
- `When I press "<key>"` - press a key or combo (Enter, Escape, Ctrl+S, Ctrl+Space, Shift+Tab, F5, etc.)
- `When I click "<css selector>" in the webview` / `When I right click "<css selector>" in the webview` / `When I middle click "<css selector>" in the webview` / `When I double click "<css selector>" in the webview` - click a webview element by stable CSS selector
- `When I click the webview element "<text>"` - click a webview control by visible text, aria-label, title, or role text when no stable selector exists
- `When I evaluate "<js>" in the webview for <n> seconds` - run diagnostic JavaScript in a webview with a caller-provided timeout budget; the timeout must be less than the step timeout
- `Then I collect JSON artifact "<name>" from webview expression "<js>"` - evaluate JavaScript in the active/current webview and save the returned strict JSON value as a run artifact
- `Then I collect JSON artifact "<name>" from extension host expression "<js>"` - evaluate JavaScript in the extension host and save the returned strict JSON value as a run artifact
- `When I move the mouse to <x>, <y>` - move the OS cursor to coordinates. In live sessions these are relative to the full Dev Host window/screenshot; in normal batch runs they are absolute screen coordinates.
- `When I click` / `When I right click` / `When I middle click` / `When I double click` - click at the current mouse position
- `When I click at <x>, <y>` / `When I right click at <x>, <y>` / `When I middle click at <x>, <y>` / `When I double click at <x>, <y>` - click coordinates. In live sessions these are relative to the full Dev Host window/screenshot, including title bar and borders; in normal batch runs they are absolute screen coordinates.
- `When I right click the element "<name>"` - open a context menu on an accessible element by name/text
- `When I sign in with Microsoft as "<user>"` - handle Microsoft auth flow
- `Then I should see notification "<text>"` - assert a notification contains text
- `Then I should not see notification "<text>"` - assert NO notification contains text
- `Then I wait for QuickInput item "<label>"` - wait for a visible QuickInput item
- `Then I wait for QuickInput title "<text>"` - wait for a QuickInput title
- `Then I wait for QuickInput value "<value>"` - wait for the current QuickInput value
- `Then the QuickInput should contain item "<label>"` - assert the current QuickInput has an item
- `Then the QuickInput title should contain "<text>"` - assert QuickInput title text
- `Then the QuickInput value should be "<value>"` - assert QuickInput value
- `Then I wait for progress "<title>" to start` / `Then I wait for progress "<title>" to complete` - wait for a tracked long-running operation
- `Then progress "<title>" should be active` / `Then progress "<title>" should be completed` - assert tracked progress state
- `Then the editor should contain "<text>"` - assert the active editor has text
- `Then the output channel "<name>" should contain "<text>"` - assert output channel content
- `Then the output channel "<name>" should not contain "<text>"` - assert output channel does NOT contain text
- `Then I wait <n> second(s)` - pause for n seconds

### Reliable Input Targeting

Use the most semantic target that can reach the UI:

1. Prefer VS Code commands and QuickInput inspection/selection/text steps when the behavior is command-driven; these steps fall back to the visible workbench QuickInput widget when no extension-host session was intercepted.
2. For webviews, prefer stable CSS selectors such as `[data-testid='...']`; selector clicks use DOM-first activation and collect diagnostics on failure.
3. If a webview has no stable selector, use `I click the webview element "<text>"` before falling back to native automation.
4. For workbench/native UI, use accessible-name clicks such as `I click the element "Run Query"` or `I right click the element "Explorer"`.
5. Prefer QuickInput/progress/notification wait steps over fixed sleeps.
6. Use raw coordinates only as a last resort. In live sessions, raw coordinates are full Dev Host window/screenshot-relative; in normal batch runs, they are absolute screen coordinates. Stabilize the window first with `I resize the Dev Host...` / `I move the Dev Host...`.

Right-clicking and popup selection are two separate actions: first use a
right-click step to open the context menu, then use
`When I select "<label>" from the popup menu`.

### Settings

Change or verify any VS Code or extension-contributed setting at runtime:

- `When I set setting "<key>" to "<value>"` - set a setting (applies to user/global scope by default)
- `Then setting "<key>" should be "<value>"` - assert a setting has the expected value

**Value parsing.** The value is JSON-parsed when possible:
- `"true"` / `"false"` → boolean
- `"42"` → number
- `"null"` → resets the setting to its default (VS Code treats `null` as "remove override")
- Anything that is not valid JSON stays as a plain string (e.g. `"on"`, `"hello"`)

**Works for any setting** — built-in VS Code settings (`editor.fontSize`,
`editor.minimap.enabled`) and extension-contributed settings
(`myExtension.enableFeature`, `extensionTester.controllerPort`).

**Settings persist across scenarios** within the same test run. They are NOT
reverted by the `the extension is in a clean state` reset step. If you need
a clean baseline, explicitly set the value back at the start of each scenario.

Example:

\\`\\`\\`gherkin
Feature: Extension respects font size setting
  Scenario: Large font
    When I set setting "editor.fontSize" to "24"
    Then setting "editor.fontSize" should be "24"

  Scenario: Boolean toggle
    When I set setting "editor.minimap.enabled" to "false"
    Then setting "editor.minimap.enabled" should be "false"

  Scenario: Extension setting
    When I set setting "myExtension.maxResults" to "100"
    Then setting "myExtension.maxResults" should be "100"

  Scenario: Reset to default
    When I set setting "editor.fontSize" to "null"
\\`\\`\\`

### Click/Focus Elements by Accessible Name (Windows UI Automation)
These use Windows accessibility to find and click elements by their name or text.
They work for ANY element - including inside webviews, custom editors, and dialogs:
- `When I click the element "<name>"` - click an element by its accessible name/text
- `When I right click the element "<name>"` - right-click an element by its accessible name/text
- `When I middle click the element "<name>"` - middle-click an element by its accessible name/text
- `When I double click the element "<name>"` - double-click an element by its accessible name/text
- `When I click the "<name>" button` - click a button by name
- `When I click the "<name>" edit` - click a text field by name

Example - click a button inside a webview:
\\`\\`\\`gherkin
When I click the element "Select favorite..."
When I click the element "Run Query"
When I click the "File name:" edit
\\`\\`\\`

### Webview DOM Steps (CSS Selectors via Chrome DevTools)

For complex webviews - multiple sections, tables, panels, custom controls - the
accessibility-name approach often isn't precise enough. These steps use CSS
selectors and Chrome DevTools Protocol so you can target *exactly* the element
you want, including ones that are hidden, off-screen, or inside shadow DOM
(e.g. LitElement, Shoelace, or other Web Component frameworks).

**Shadow DOM is pierced automatically.** All CSS selector steps (`I click`,
`I wait for`, `element should exist`, `element should have text`, etc.)
will find elements inside open shadow roots without any extra work. You write
selectors exactly the same way as for light DOM. The framework tries
`document.querySelector` first (fast path), then recursively walks shadow
roots on miss. **Limitation:** closed shadow roots (`mode: 'closed'`) are
not accessible — this is by design in the web platform.

**You have access to the extension source code when you write tests.** Inspect
the webview's HTML/Lit/React source to find the right selectors (`data-testid`,
class names, ids) - then assert against them directly.

### Improving Webview Testability

Before writing complex webview tests, **think about whether the extension's
webview markup is testable.** If you find yourself writing fragile selectors
based on deeply nested class names, generated IDs, or DOM structure that could
change with any UI refactor - **stop and recommend testability improvements
to the extension source code first.**

The pattern:

1. **Add `data-testid` attributes** to key interactive elements and sections
   in the webview's source code (HTML, Lit, React, Svelte, etc.). Every button,
   form field, section container, status indicator, and action target should
   have a stable `data-testid`. These survive refactors, theming changes, and
   framework upgrades. Examples:
   - `data-testid="add-connection-btn"`
   - `data-testid="connection-form"`
   - `data-testid="results-section"`
   - `data-testid="status-indicator"`

2. **Shadow DOM just works.** CSS selector steps automatically pierce open
   shadow roots. You do NOT need to add `__testFind`/`__testClick` helper
   functions to the webview code. Just use `data-testid` selectors as normal:
   \\`\\`\\`gherkin
   When I click "[data-testid='add-connection-btn']" in the webview
   Then element "[data-testid='status-indicator']" should exist
   Then element "[data-testid='results-section']" should have text "42 rows"
   \\`\\`\\`

   If the webview uses closed shadow roots (`mode: 'closed'`), the framework
   cannot reach inside them. In that rare case, the extension would need to
   expose test helpers on `window` callable via `I evaluate` steps.

3. **Then write your E2E tests** using these stable selectors. A test like
   `When I click "[data-testid='add-connection-btn']" in the webview` is
   rock-solid - it won't break when someone changes the button's CSS class,
   moves it to a different container, or swaps the UI framework.

**When you encounter a webview that lacks `data-testid` attributes, include
this as a recommendation in your test report.** Suggest the specific elements
that need `data-testid` attributes and what values they should have. This is
a framework blocker report (see the R&D section above) - improving testability
in the extension source is part of the testing process.

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `When I wait for "<sel>" in the webview` | Wait up to 10s for an element to appear |
| `When I wait for "<sel>" in the webview "<title>"` | Restrict to a specific webview |
| `When I wait for "<sel>" in the webview for <n> seconds` | Custom timeout |
| `When I click "<sel>" in the webview` | Click any element by selector |
| `When I click "<sel>" in the webview "<title>"` | Click in a specific webview |
| `When I right click "<sel>" in the webview` | Right-click an element by selector |
| `When I middle click "<sel>" in the webview` | Middle-click an element by selector |
| `When I double click "<sel>" in the webview` | Double-click an element by selector |
| `When I focus "<sel>" in the webview` | Focus an input or scroll container |
| `When I scroll "<sel>" by <dx> <dy>` | Scroll a container relatively |
| `When I scroll "<sel>" to <x> <y>` | Scroll to absolute coords |
| `When I scroll "<sel>" to the (top\\|bottom\\|left\\|right)` | Jump to an edge |
| `When I scroll "<sel>" into view` | Scroll the element itself into view |
| `When I evaluate "<js>" in the webview` | Run arbitrary JS (escape hatch) |
| `Then I collect JSON artifact "<name>" from webview expression "<js>"` | Save strict JSON returned from a webview expression |
| `Then I collect JSON artifact "<name>" from extension host expression "<js>"` | Save strict JSON returned from an extension-host expression |
| `When I list the webviews` | Log all open webview titles, probed DOM titles, and URLs (debugging aid) |
| `When I list the frame contexts` | Log all execution contexts (frames) inside webview targets — shows context IDs, origins, frame IDs, and the frame tree. Use to diagnose when evaluate/click steps can't find elements inside nested iframes. |
| `When I list the frame contexts in the webview "<title>"` | Same, but restricted to a specific webview |
| `Then the webview should contain "<text>"` | Substring match in body text |
| `Then the webview "<title>" should contain "<text>"` | Restrict to a webview |
| `Then element "<sel>" should exist` | Existence assertion |
| `Then element "<sel>" should not exist` | Negative existence |
| `Then element "<sel>" should have text "<text>"` | Text content assertion |

**Webview targeting.** When multiple webviews are open at once (walkthroughs,
panels, sidebar views), pass a `<title>` substring to disambiguate. The
framework uses a 3-tier matching strategy (all case-insensitive):

1. **CDP target title / URL** — the fastest check; matches the title and URL
   that Chrome DevTools Protocol reports for each webview target.
2. **Tab activation** — if tier 1 misses, the framework asks VS Code to
   activate (bring to front) the tab whose label matches, ensuring the
   webview's DOM is live for the next step.
3. **DOM title probe** — connects to each webview via CDP and evaluates
   `document.title` across all frames (including nested cross-origin
   iframes). This catches webviews whose CDP target title is generic but
   whose inner HTML sets a meaningful `<title>`.

**Cross-origin iframe support.** VS Code webview panels use deeply nested
cross-origin iframes (main renderer → `vscode-webview://` outer → inner
content frame). The framework automatically discovers all execution contexts
across all frames within each webview target — including inner iframes whose
contexts may take longer to register. When interacting with custom editor
webviews that use Web Components (Lit, Shoelace, etc.) rendered inside these
nested frames, all CSS selector steps and evaluate steps traverse every frame
automatically. If you suspect a frame discovery issue (e.g. an element exists
but the framework can't find it), use `When I list the frame contexts` to
inspect which execution contexts and frames were discovered.

This means **the VS Code tab label usually works as the title** — the
framework will find it via tab activation + DOM probing even when the CDP
target title doesn't match. If your title still isn't matching, use the
debugging step `When I list the webviews` to see what titles, probed titles,
and URLs the framework actually sees. Omit the title and the framework tries
every webview until one matches.

**Scrolling a specific section or table.** Find a stable selector for the
container (not the page) - e.g. `section[data-testid="results-table"] .scroll-body`
or `.kw-section--results .table-scroll`. Then:

\\`\\`\\`gherkin
Scenario: Scroll the results table
  When I execute command "kusto.runQuery"
  And I wait for ".kw-results .scroll-body" in the webview
  And I scroll ".kw-results .scroll-body" to the bottom
  Then element ".kw-results tr:last-child" should exist
\\`\\`\\`

\\`\\`\\`gherkin
Scenario: Horizontally scroll a wide table
  When I scroll ".kw-results .scroll-body" by 800 0
  Then element ".kw-results th[data-col=\"timestamp\"]" should exist
\\`\\`\\`

\\`\\`\\`gherkin
Scenario: Click a button in a specific section of the dashboard
  When I click ".kw-section--charts button.export" in the webview "Dashboard"
  Then I should see notification "Export complete"
\\`\\`\\`

**Escape hatch - evaluate JS.** Use sparingly, but when the selector-based
steps cannot express what you need (e.g. you need to inspect a virtualized
list's internal state), reach for `I evaluate`:

\\`\\`\\`gherkin
When I evaluate "document.querySelectorAll('.row').length" in the webview
\\`\\`\\`

The expression is wrapped in an IIFE; return a value via the last expression.
Async expressions are awaited.

**Performance artifacts.** Use `--perf`, `--iterations <n>`, and `--warmup <n>` when a workflow needs repeated measurement. Warmup runs are written under `warmup-001/`; measured runs are written under `iteration-001/`, `iteration-002/`, and so on. JSON artifact steps and CLI collectors are listed in `results.json` and `report.md`. With `--perf`, the run also writes `perf-summary.json` and `perf-summary.md`, summarizing numeric fields in measured JSON artifacts with count, min, median, p95, max, and mean.

For complex JavaScript artifact expressions, prefer a doc string so quotes do not need escaping:

\`\`\`gherkin
Then I collect JSON artifact "custom-state" from webview expression:
  """
  ({ title: document.title, sections: document.querySelectorAll('section').length })
  """
\`\`\`

In `--attach-devhost` mode, repeat runs and artifact collection can use the existing Dev Host, but `--env` and `--vscode-arg` cannot change the already-running VS Code process.

### Capturing Output Channels

The controller automatically wraps every `vscode.window.createOutputChannel`
call so it can read back what was written - even for channels created by the
extension under test. After every scenario, the captured content is dumped to
the run's artifacts directory:

```
runs/<test-id>/output-channels/
  Kusto_Workbench.log              # cumulative across all scenarios
  Kusto_Workbench__formatted.log
  My_Scenario_Name/
    Kusto_Workbench.log            # only this scenario's content (snapshot)
    Kusto_Workbench__formatted.log
```

**You don't need to declare anything for default capture** - every channel is
captured. Use the steps below to make capture explicit (which also switches the
controller into allow-list mode, so only the declared channels are dumped):

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Given I capture the output channel "<name>"` | Declare a channel to capture |
| `Given I stop capturing the output channel "<name>"` | Remove from allow-list |
| `Then the output channel "<name>" should have been captured` | Asserts non-empty |
| `Then the output channel "<name>" should contain "<text>"` | Substring assertion |
| `Then the output channel "<name>" should not contain "<text>"` | Negative assertion |

Example - capture a specific channel and verify a log line:

\\`\\`\\`gherkin
Feature: Query execution writes a structured trace
  Background:
    Given the extension is in a clean state
    And I capture the output channel "Kusto Workbench"

  Scenario: Trace contains the executed query
    When I execute command "kusto.runQuery"
    And I wait 3 seconds
    Then the output channel "Kusto Workbench" should contain "StormEvents | take 10"
    And the output channel "Kusto Workbench" should have been captured
\\`\\`\\`

**Important caveat.** Channels created by the target extension *before the
controller activates* cannot be captured retroactively - VS Code's API does
not expose enumeration of existing output channels. The controller declares
`activationEvents: ["*"]` so it activates as early as possible, but if your
extension creates a channel synchronously inside its own `activate()` and
loses the activation race, the channel will not be wrapped. The fix is to
defer channel creation by one tick (`queueMicrotask` / `setImmediate`) inside
your extension, or to call `createOutputChannel` lazily on first use.

### Native OS Automation (Windows)

These steps use a FlaUI bridge (.NET) to automate native Windows dialogs that
VS Code cannot control via its API — file pickers, message boxes, window
management.

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `When I open the file "<path>"` | Handle Open File dialog: type filename, press Enter |
| `When I save the file as "<path>"` | Handle Save As dialog: type filename, press Enter |
| `When I click "<button>" on the "<title>" dialog` | Click a button on any native dialog by title |
| `When I cancel the Save As dialog` | Dismiss a Save/Open dialog (presses Escape) |
| `When I cancel the Open dialog` | Same — works for any file dialog variant |
| `When I resize the (window\\|Dev Host) to <W>x<H>` | Resize the Dev Host window |
| `When I move the (window\\|Dev Host) to <x>, <y>` | Move the Dev Host window |

**Important: triggering native dialogs from VS Code.**

Native file dialogs appear when you run commands like
`workbench.action.files.openFile` (Ctrl+O) or `workbench.action.files.save`
with an untitled file. These commands **block until the dialog is dismissed**,
so you MUST use `I start command` (fire-and-forget), NOT `I execute command`
(which waits for completion and would hang).

After starting the command, **wait for the dialog to appear** before
interacting with it:

\\`\\`\\`gherkin
When I start command "workbench.action.files.openFile"
And I wait 3 seconds
And I open the file "C:\\Users\\me\\data.csv"
\\`\\`\\`

**Paths must be absolute.** The file dialog types the path into the OS "File
name:" edit field and presses Enter. Relative paths resolve relative to
whatever folder the dialog is currently browsing — which is unpredictable.
Always use absolute paths.

**Tip — use `${TEMP}` for temp files.** The `${VAR}` syntax resolves from
environment variables. Combine with the temp file step:

\\`\\`\\`gherkin
Given a temp file "test-data.txt" exists with content "hello world"
When I start command "workbench.action.files.openFile"
And I wait 3 seconds
And I open the file "${TEMP}\\test-data.txt"
And I wait 2 seconds
Then the editor should contain "hello world"
\\`\\`\\`

### Screenshots
- `Then I take a screenshot` - capture the targeted Extension Development Host window, saved to the run directory
- `Then I take a screenshot "label"` - capture the targeted Dev Host with a descriptive label (e.g. "after-query-runs")

### File Utilities (direct via code - no UI dialogs)
Use these for test setup when you don't need to test the actual dialog interaction:
- `Given a file "<path>" exists` - create an empty file (relative to cwd or absolute)
- `Given a file "<path>" exists with content "<text>"` - create a file with content
- `Given a file "<path>" exists with content:` plus a doc string - create a file from JSON or multiline content
- `Given a temp file "<name>" exists` - create in OS temp directory
- `Given a temp file "<name>" exists with content "<text>"` - create temp file with content
- `Given a temp file "<name>" exists with content:` plus a doc string - create a temp file from JSON or multiline content
- `When I open file "<path>" in the editor` - open file directly (no Open dialog)
- `When I delete file "<path>"` - delete a file
- `Then the file "<path>" should exist` - assert file exists on disk
- `Then the file "<path>" should contain "<text>"` - assert file content

Inline file content supports escaped quotes and common escapes: `\"`, `\\`, `\n`, `\r`, and `\t`. Literal backslashes in inline content must be escaped as `\\`, so write Windows-style content as `C:\\temp\\new.txt`. For JSON or multiline fixtures, prefer a doc string:

\`\`\`gherkin
Given a file "fixture.json" exists with content:
  """
  {"kind":"customEditor","version":1}
  """
\`\`\`

### Clean State

Every test should start from a known state. Use Background to reset before each scenario:

\\`\\`\\`gherkin
Feature: My tests
  Background:
    Given the extension is in a clean state
    And I wait 1 second

  Scenario: First test
    When I execute command "myExtension.doSomething"
    ...
\\`\\`\\`

The reset step closes all editors, dismisses notifications, clears output channels,
and closes panels/sidebars. This ensures each scenario starts from the same baseline.

## Repo-Specific Knowledge

When you run `vscode-ext-test install-into-project`, a `repo-knowledge.md` file is created in
`.github/skills/e2e-test-extension/` alongside this SKILL.md. Unlike SKILL.md
(which is overwritten on every `install-into-project` to stay current with framework updates),
**`repo-knowledge.md` is never overwritten** — it is your persistent,
repo-specific knowledge base.

Use `repo-knowledge.md` to record things you learn about testing THIS specific
codebase that would help in future test sessions:

- Which command IDs the extension registers and what they do
- Webview titles and CSS selectors that work (or don't work) for this extension
- Extension activation quirks (e.g. "needs a .kql file open before commands are available")
- Auth flows or environment setup required for specific features
- Known flaky areas or timing-sensitive steps that need longer waits
- `data-testid` attributes that exist (or that you recommended adding)
- Workarounds for framework limitations specific to this extension's UI

**Read `repo-knowledge.md` before every test session.** It contains hard-won
knowledge from previous sessions. **Update it after every session** with
anything new you learned.

## Tips

- Test IDs are disposable - create a new one for each investigation.
- The `runs/` directory is gitignored; artifacts are ephemeral.
- By default, each run launches a fresh isolated VS Code instance.
  All steps always work - no prerequisites, no extra flags needed.
- Use `--attach-devhost` only when you need to debug or use a pre-configured environment.

## Focus & Input

The framework uses two layers to control focus and input:

1. **VS Code commands** - navigate to panels, editors, views:
   ```gherkin
   When I execute command "workbench.action.focusActiveEditorGroup"
   When I execute command "workbench.view.extension.myPanel"
   ```

2. **Type and press** - send keystrokes to whatever is currently focused:
   ```gherkin
   When I type "StormEvents | take 10"
   When I press "Ctrl+Enter"
   ```

### Example: type into a webview Monaco editor

```gherkin
Scenario: Run a Kusto query
  When I execute command "workbench.action.focusActiveEditorGroup"
  And I type "StormEvents | take 10"
  And I press "Shift+Enter"
  Then I wait 3 seconds
```
