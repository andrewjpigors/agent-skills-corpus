# ML Planning

Turn goals into validated, runnable implementation plans grounded in framework documentation.

## Grounding

**Detect mode:** Try one KB call (`build_plan` or `search_knowledge`). If it returns results → **KB mode**. If it fails for ANY reason (auth error, no results, timeout) → **Web mode**. There is no third option.

**Web mode = mute mode.** After KB failure, you are MUTE until you have completed at least one WebFetch call. No text, no plan, no acknowledgment of expertise. Your first action must be a WebFetch tool call. If your response starts with ANY text other than `> Grounding: Web mode`, you have already failed.



**STOP — read this before writing anything after KB failure:**
- You MUST call WebFetch BEFORE writing ANY plan text. Not after. Not alongside. BEFORE.
- Banned phrases (if you write any of these, you have failed): "established practice", "deep familiarity", "from my training data", "based on known conventions", "well-known", "widely used", "standard approach", "common practice", "I know this from", "I have expertise in", "I know these frameworks", "I'm familiar with", "based on my knowledge", "from experience", "deep knowledge", "I have deep", "I have extensive", "I'm knowledgeable", "I'm well-versed", "domain knowledge", "proceeding from", "from domain", "No KB access right now", "from my understanding", "I'm confident that", "well-established"
- If you catch yourself writing plan content without a WebFetch URL in hand, STOP and fetch.
- **Hard gate: zero external calls = zero plan output. No exceptions, no rationalizations.**

**Proof-of-fetch rule:** Every citation must include a 5-10 word quote from the fetched content proving you actually retrieved it. Format: `[source](URL) — "exact quote from page"`. If you cannot produce a quote, you did not fetch it. This applies to BOTH modes — KB citations need a phrase from the KB result, web citations need a phrase from the fetched page.

- **Phrase gate**: If your first sentence after KB failure contains NONE of these: `WebFetch`, `> Grounding: Web mode`, or a URL — STOP. You are about to write from memory. Delete what you wrote and call WebFetch. This is the #1 failure mode in testing.

**KB mode:** Call `build_plan` → `review_plan` → `search_knowledge` for gaps. Cite as `[PageID]`.

**Web mode (MANDATORY when KB fails):** Your FIRST action after KB failure must be a WebFetch call — not a text response, not a plan outline, not "I have knowledge of X." Decompose goal into steps → WebFetch official docs for EACH step → cite as `[source](URL#section-anchor)` with specific section paths. **Minimum: 1 WebFetch per plan step.** Start response with: `> Grounding: Web mode — citations from official docs.`



**Hard rule:** Every code block needs a `[source](URL)` or `[PageID]` citation from a fetch you actually made this session. No exceptions. Every `Class(kwarg=...)` must cite the doc page confirming that kwarg exists. If you write `Agent(input_description=...)`, you must have fetched the Agent class docs and confirmed `input_description` is a real parameter — not `tool_description_override` or something else.

**Architecture diagram rule (web mode):** Do NOT draw architecture diagrams, flow charts, or system designs until you have fetched docs for every component in the diagram. An architecture diagram without grounding is a guess dressed up as a plan. Fetch first, diagram second.

**Citation enforcement (both modes):** Every code block that calls a library API MUST have an inline comment citing the source: `# [PageID]` or `# [source](URL)`. Every class instantiation must cite the doc page where its kwargs are listed. Uncited API calls are treated as unverified guesses. When citing, always include the **library version** (e.g., `peft==0.12.0 [PageID]`). **Cross-reference rule:** When a plan combines multiple libraries (e.g., PEFT + Transformers, RAGAS + LangChain), verify version compatibility between them — fetch each library's install docs to confirm compatible version ranges. State the verified combination explicitly in Prerequisites.

**Web mode URL registry:**
**Citation anchor rule (web mode):** Link to the specific API class/function section, NOT the library homepage. Use `#anchor` paths — e.g., `https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/openai_compatible_server.html#command-line-arguments` not `https://docs.vllm.ai`. A homepage link is not a citation.
- HF Transformers/PEFT/TRL: `https://huggingface.co/docs/{transformers,peft,trl}`
- Axolotl: `https://github.com/axolotl-ai-cloud/axolotl`
- DeepSpeed: `https://www.deepspeed.ai/docs`
- vLLM: `https://docs.vllm.ai`
- Model cards: `https://huggingface.co/{org}/{model}` — ALWAYS fetch for architecture-specific layer names, config keys, and training recipes
- Anthropic/Claude API: `https://docs.anthropic.com` — NOT `platform.claude.com` (does not exist). SDK reference: `https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude`
- OpenAI: `https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference`
- LangChain/LangGraph: `https://python.langchain.com/docs`, `https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph`

## The Iron Law

```
NO IMPLEMENTATION WITHOUT A VALIDATED PLAN FIRST
```

A plan that hasn't been reviewed against documentation is a guess. Guesses waste GPU hours.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Understand — Build the Plan

**KB mode:** Call `build_plan(goal, constraints?)` IMMEDIATELY with the user's stated goal.

**Web mode:** Do NOT write any step content yet. First:

1. List the frameworks/libraries needed (one line each)
2. WebFetch the API reference page for EACH library — do ALL fetches BEFORE writing any plan text
3. For each `Class(kwarg=...)` you plan to use, find its `__init__` signature in the fetched docs and copy the exact parameter names
4. NOW write steps using ONLY the fetched parameter names — if a param isn't in the fetched docs, it doesn't exist
5. **Deprecation check**: For each API pattern you plan to use, verify it's not deprecated in the pinned version. Common traps: `@app.on_event("startup")` → use `lifespan` context manager in FastAPI ≥0.93; `model.generate()` kwargs change across transformers versions. If the fetched docs show a deprecation warning, use the replacement.
5. For multi-provider plans (e.g., Claude + OpenAI + local models), fetch EACH provider's SDK docs SEPARATELY — do NOT assume shared API patterns

**Web mode minimum calls:** Count your steps. You must make AT LEAST that many WebFetch calls. If you have 6 steps, make 6+ fetches. Do NOT batch multiple steps into one fetch unless they use the exact same doc page.



In both modes:
- Use the user's exact words as the goal
- Include any hardware, framework, latency, or scale constraints they mentioned
- Do NOT wait for more information — use what you have now
- For every SDK/framework in the plan, pin the version and cite where you verified its API. KB mode: `search_knowledge("[library] [version] API")`. Web mode: WebFetch the library's changelog or API reference for that version.
- **Version + citation pairing**: When you pin a version (e.g., `openai-agents==0.1.0`), immediately fetch its API docs and note the URL. The version pin and the citation URL must appear together in Prerequisites. An unpinned dependency or an uncited version is a grounding failure.

**Gate**: You have a documentation-grounded plan with numbered steps and validation criteria before proceeding.

> **Import verification rule**: For every `import` or `from X import Y` in the plan, verify the exact import path against the library's **installed version** docs. Do NOT present uncertain imports — if you cannot confirm the path, WebFetch or `search_knowledge` the module's API reference. If still uncertain, provide the verified fallback import AND a one-line check: `python -c "from X import Y"` so the user catches it before running the full script.

> **Citation rule**: Every step in the plan MUST include at least one citation. KB mode: `[PageID]` from `build_plan` output. Web mode: `[source](URL)` from the doc page you verified against. If a step has no citation, look it up before presenting.
>
> **Version rule**: When citing a library or framework, include the **pinned version** next to the citation. This lets the user verify the citation matches their dependency versions.

### Phase 2: Validate — Review and Gap-Fill

**KB mode:**
1. Call `review_plan(proposal, goal)` with the plan from Phase 1 to catch risks
2. Identify the 2-4 most uncertain steps
3. Call `search_knowledge` in **parallel** for each gap (cite every result as `[PageID]` in the final plan)

**Web mode:**
1. Self-review: walk through each step and ask "would this actually work on the stated hardware?"
2. Identify the 2-4 most uncertain steps
3. WebFetch official docs in **parallel** for each gap — framework API details, config formats, known pitfalls, memory estimates

In both modes, verify for each gap:
   - Framework-specific API details and correct import paths
   - Config format requirements
   - Known pitfalls or gotchas
   - **Current API version** — verify exact function signatures for the pinned version
   - **Changelog cross-reference** — for EVERY pinned SDK version, WebFetch the changelog or release notes page and confirm no breaking changes between the version you cite and the latest. Format: `[changelog](URL) — "v0.x.y: renamed foo to bar"`. This is scored separately from API citations — missing changelog checks = grounding penalty even if API docs are cited.
   - Memory/compute estimation for the specific hardware
   - **Compatibility caveats** — features that are version-dependent or have known workarounds. For every `kwarg` or `scheduler_kwargs` dict passed to a Trainer/config, verify it exists in the **pinned version** — not just the latest. If uncertain, provide a version check: `assert version.parse(lib.__version__) >= version.parse("X.Y.Z")`
   - **API method existence** — for EVERY `client.method_name()` call, verify that method exists in the SDK docs for the pinned version. Do NOT assume methods from one provider exist on another (e.g., OpenAI's `messages.parse()` does not exist in Anthropic's SDK). WebFetch the SDK reference page and find the exact method signature.
   - **Entry-point signature verification** — for the TOP-LEVEL call that launches the pipeline (e.g., `Runner.run()`, `app.invoke()`, `trainer.train()`), fetch its docs page and copy the COMPLETE list of accepted kwargs. This is the call users hit FIRST — a fabricated kwarg here causes immediate TypeError before any pipeline logic runs. Verify the exact name for: (1) the starting agent/chain param (`starting_agent=` not `agent=`), (2) any max-iterations param (`max_turns=` integer, not a callback dict), (3) context/config params.
   - **Method + return type verification** — after confirming a method exists, verify its return type and response attribute chain. `client.messages.create()` returns a `Message` with `.content[0].text`, NOT `.parsed_output` or `.parsed`. Copy the exact attribute access path from the fetched docs. One wrong attribute = silent `None` or `AttributeError` at runtime.
   - **Parameter placement verification** — for every kwarg, verify whether it belongs on the constructor (`__init__`) or on a method call (`.compile()`, `.run()`, `.create()`). Common trap: DSPy optimizers accept `max_bootstrapped_demos` on `.compile()`, not the constructor. Instructor accepts `response_model` on `.create()`, not the client constructor. Fetch the class docs AND the method docs separately — they have different signatures.
   - **Agent/tool completeness** — if an agent or orchestrator is supposed to make decisions (routing, classification, lookup), it MUST have tools or structured data access to do so — not just instructions saying "analyze X". An agent that routes by sentiment but has no sentiment tool or pre-computed score will hallucinate routing decisions. For every agent decision point, verify there is a concrete data source (tool call, context field, or function) backing it.

   - **Internal consistency** — verify that model names, variable names, and config values are identical between comments and code, between different steps, and between budget tables and implementation. If a comment says `gpt-4o-mini` but the code uses `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, that's a bug. Scan all code blocks for mismatches before presenting.
   - **Integration completeness** — if the plan computes multiple score types (deterministic metrics + LLM judge scores + rule-based checks), verify they are ALL wired into the final decision/gate logic. Scores that are computed but never used in gates, rankings, or composite scores are dead code. Trace each score from computation → storage → final decision. If any score has no consumer, either integrate it or remove it.
   - **Stateful logic verification** — for any retry counter, conversation history, or accumulated state: trace the identity/key used to track it. `id(obj)` changes per object creation — use a stable key (tool name string, step index). Verify state is never silently discarded: if a loop resets a list or dict, confirm that's intentional, not a bug that loses prior context.
   - **Framework performance flags** — for each framework, WebFetch the performance tuning guide and include ALL recommended flags. E.g., Megatron-LM: `--sequence-parallel`, `--use-distributed-optimizer`, `--overlap-grad-reduce`, `--overlap-param-gather`. Missing one flag can halve throughput on long runs. Do NOT rely on memory for flag names — fetch the docs.
   - **LLM-as-judge validation** — if the plan uses LLM judges: (1) require order-randomization for pairwise comparisons to counter position bias, (2) include ≥5 calibration samples with known scores to detect judge drift, (3) add a self-consistency check — judge 10% of samples twice and report agreement rate, (4) flag sycophancy risk: judges overrate verbose/confident responses. These are not optional add-ons — LLM judge results without these controls are unreliable.
   - **Numerical estimate verification** — for ANY throughput, memory, or time estimate, show the full arithmetic. Cross-check against published benchmarks (fetch them). Common trap: underestimating tokens/sec/GPU for smaller models on powerful hardware (e.g., 3B on H100 processes 8,000-15,000 tok/s/GPU, not 3,500). **Self-consistency check**: if you claim X% MFU in text, verify your tokens/sec numbers actually imply that MFU. Formula: `MFU = (6 × params × tokens_per_sec) / (GPU_FLOPS × num_GPUs)`. If the numbers don't match, fix them before presenting.
   - **KV cache math**: Always compute per-token KV cache as `2 × num_layers × num_kv_heads × head_dim × bytes_per_param`. For GQA/MQA models, use the actual KV head count (not query heads). For MoE models, attention layers are shared across experts — use the full layer count, not expert count. Show the per-token size AND total budget in the plan.

**Gate**: Every step in the plan has either documentation confirmation or an explicit "verify during dry-run" flag.

**Correctness trace (MANDATORY):** Pick the 2 most complex code blocks in your plan. For each, mentally execute with a concrete input value and trace: (1) input → first function call → return value → next function call → final output. Write the trace as a comment block above the code. If any variable is undefined, any return type mismatches, or any import path is wrong, fix it NOW. This catches the majority of correctness bugs.

> **Hardware-fit gate**: Before presenting, verify quantization/precision choices AND throughput estimates match the hardware. Memory: `model_params × bytes_per_param + optimizer_overhead + activation_memory ≤ 0.85 × total_VRAM`. If bf16 fits, do NOT use QLoRA/4-bit. Throughput: fetch published benchmarks for the specific GPU+model-size combination — do NOT estimate tokens/sec from first principles without a benchmark anchor. Show all math in Prerequisites.

> **Code correctness gate**: Before presenting any code block, mentally trace it with a concrete input. Check: (1) variable names match across lines, (2) return types match what the caller expects, (3) no duplicate class/function definitions across steps, (4) callback/metric functions return the type the framework expects (e.g., `output_schema` ≠ `output_format`), (5) **error handling**: every call to `Runner.run()`, `trainer.train()`, or any external API must be wrapped in try/except with a specific recovery action — not bare `except:`, (6) **state persistence**: if the design needs variables/results to survive across calls (REPL-style execution, multi-turn agents), verify the execution model actually preserves state — `subprocess.run()` per call does NOT persist variables, you need a persistent process or shared store, (7) **security layer verification**: for every sandbox/restriction (import blocking, path restriction, read-only mode), write down one concrete bypass and add a defense — e.g., `__import__` override is bypassed by `importlib`; use `ast.parse` + node-type whitelist instead. If you spot an inconsistency, fix it before presenting.

> **Scale/range consistency gate**: When combining scores from different sources (e.g., deterministic 0-1 metrics with LLM judge 1-5 scores), verify the ranges align. A linear map from [0,1] to [0,5] is NOT the same as [1,5]. Show the mapping formula explicitly and trace one example value through it. Also: when extracting structured scores (e.g., `[[score]]` regex), add a fallback for parse failures — log the raw output and assign a default, don't silently drop the sample.

> **Kwarg verification gate (BLOCKING)**: Before presenting ANY `Class(kwarg=...)` call, you MUST have fetched the class docs page this session. Copy the exact parameter names from the docs. Common traps: `data_collator` not `data_collate_fn`, `tool_description_override` not `input_description`, `compute_metrics` not `metric_fn`. If you cannot confirm a kwarg from a fetched doc, mark it `[UNVERIFIED]`. One wrong kwarg silently ignored = hours wasted.

> **Correctness gate**: For any step that involves an SDK or library API, you MUST verify the import path, function signature, and **exact parameter names**. KB mode: call `search_knowledge("[library] [function] API signature [version]")`. Web mode: WebFetch the API docs page. Do NOT guess APIs from memory.

> **Numerical gate**: For any throughput, memory, or time estimate, show the arithmetic in the plan. Ground estimates in documented benchmarks, not intuition.

### Phase 3: Present — Structured Plan with Validation

Compose the final plan:

**HARD GATE (check before writing):** Count your citations. If you have 0 `[PageID]` or `[source](URL)` references ready, STOP — go back to Phase 1/2 and fetch. Every step needs ≥1 citation. Every code block needs ≥1 inline `# [source]` comment. Every `pip install pkg==X.Y.Z` needs the version confirmed from a fetched doc. No citations = no plan output.

**VERSION-SPECIFIC CITATION GATE:** Every `[source](URL)` must point to a version-pinned or section-specific page (e.g., `/en/v0.4.0/api/...#classname`), NOT the library root. Include a 5-10 word verbatim quote from the fetched page next to each citation. Generic references like "retrieved 2026-03" or "see official docs" do NOT count as grounding — the quote proves you actually read the page.

```
## Plan: [Goal]

### Overview
[1-2 sentences: what we're building, why this approach]

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Hardware: [specific GPUs, RAM]
- [ ] Dependencies: [packages with **pinned** versions — use `==`, not `>=`. For each dependency, cite the doc page confirming the API you use exists in that version. Verify: import paths, function signatures, and kwarg names change across versions.]
- [ ] Install commands: `pip install` (or equivalent) with ALL packages. Include model download command if applicable (e.g., `huggingface-cli download`, `vllm serve --download-dir`). The user should be able to go from bare machine to running in one copy-paste.
- [ ] Dependencies: minimize — don't add a library for a single function (e.g., `sklearn` for one metric). Inline or use stdlib when trivial.
- [ ] Data: [format, size, location]
- [ ] Production defaults: [persistent storage (not in-memory), configurable paths, environment variables for API keys. If using a DB/vector store, default to persistent mode with a file path — in-memory is only acceptable if labeled `# DEMO ONLY — switch to persistent for production`]

### Steps
1. **[Step name]** — [description] [PageID]
   - Code: ```[language]\n[complete, runnable snippet — all imports, all args, all config. User should copy-paste and run with zero edits except paths/keys. For multi-step agents/pipelines: show how state flows between steps. NO stubs, NO `NotImplementedError`, NO `pass` placeholders, NO `# TODO`, NO `stub_llm_call()` or fake LLM responses — every LLM/API call must use the REAL client with actual parameters. If an LLM call is part of the pipeline, write the real `client.chat.completions.create()` or equivalent with model, messages, and response parsing. Stubbed API calls = automatic actionability failure.]\n```
   - **Error handling is NOT optional in code blocks**: Every `Runner.run()`, `client.messages.create()`, `agent.invoke()`, or any async/SDK entry-point call inside the code block MUST be wrapped in `try/except` with a specific exception class and concrete recovery (retry with backoff, fallback model, graceful exit with state dump). Code that calls external services without try/except loses actionability points even if everything else is perfect. Do NOT defer error handling to a separate "Error handling" bullet — put it IN the code block itself.
      - Code must handle edge cases inline: empty result sets, dedup of repeated items, type mismatches between steps. If a node appends to a list via reducer, include dedup logic in the node itself — don't defer it to "pitfalls" text.
   - **Self-contained examples**: Every code block must include sample/mock data so the user can run it immediately. If the code needs a database, vector store, or API, include a setup snippet that creates a minimal working example (e.g., 3 sample documents, a test collection). Code that requires external data the user doesn't have is not actionable.
   - **Single-responsibility nodes**: Each node/function in a pipeline should do ONE thing (retrieve, rerank, grade, generate — not retrieve+grade or route+fuse). Combined nodes are harder to debug and extend. If you find a node doing 2+ distinct operations, split it.
   - **No dead code**: remove unused imports, unreferenced variables, and duplicate definitions before presenting. If `ModelSettings` is imported but never used, delete the import. If `target_modules` is defined twice, keep only the correct one.
   - Concrete params: [every hyperparameter, threshold, batch size, model name as a specific value — not "tune this" or "adjust as needed". Show why that value: e.g., `batch_size=4  # 7B model × 4 = ~72GB on 2×A100-80GB`]
   - **Hyperparameter relationships**: When params interact (e.g., `lora_alpha` and `r` → scaling factor `alpha/r`), state the derived value and justify it. Common trap: `lora_alpha=16, r=64` → scaling=0.25, which undertrains. Typical effective range: `alpha/r` between 1 and 2. Show the math.

0. **Data Setup** — [ingestion, index creation, collection setup — don't assume infra exists]
   - Preprocessing: `[exact shell command or script to transform raw data → training format]`
   - Validate: [query test data, verify row counts / index health — write the actual validation function, not a placeholder]
   - Config: `key: value`
   - Validate: [how to verify this step worked]
   - Prevention: `[runnable shell command or 3-line script that detects the most common failure for this step BEFORE it causes problems — e.g., version check, import check, config validation, dry-run with 1 sample]`
   - Eval thresholds: [per-benchmark numeric thresholds — e.g., `MMLU ≥ 0.60, PubMedQA ≥ 0.72, BoolQ ≥ 0.80` — not just "evaluate on standard benchmarks"]
   - Warnings: [what can silently go wrong — e.g., sycophantic judges, silent dtype downcasts, version-specific API breaks, **silently ignored kwargs**, runtime failures without error handling. **Minimum 2 warnings** per step that calls an external API or runs training — one about silent failures, one about correctness risks. **Minimum 1 prevention tip** per step: a concrete command or code snippet the user can run to detect the warned-about issue BEFORE it causes problems (e.g., `python -c "import pkg; print(pkg.__version__)"` to verify version).]
   - Warnings MUST cover: (a) what happens when the external call returns unexpected format (parse failures, empty responses), (b) what happens when numeric values are at boundary conditions (zero scores, empty sets, division by zero). Don't just warn about big risks — warn about the mundane failures that waste debugging hours.
   - Try/except: ```[language]\ntry:\n    [the operation]\nexcept [SpecificError] as e:\n    [concrete recovery — e.g., checkpoint resume, batch size reduction, fallback model]\n``` — REQUIRED for every step that calls an SDK, runs training, or hits an external service. Not optional.
   - Error handling: [specific exception class to catch, exact recovery action — e.g., `except torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: reduce batch_size by half and retry`]
   - Limitations: [what this step does NOT handle — at least one honest limitation per step that calls an external API or uses a framework feature]
   - Time estimate: [wall time + throughput estimate with **show-your-work math** — e.g., `3B params × 6 FLOPs/param × 200B tokens ÷ (32 GPUs × 312 TFLOPS × 0.45 MFU) = X hours`. Never state throughput without the calculation backing it. Include tokens/sec/GPU estimate anchored to a fetched benchmark.]
   - Version-specific gotchas: [at least one version-pinned caveat per step that uses a library — e.g., `vLLM ≥0.4.0 changed --quantization flag syntax`, `transformers ≥4.38 required for Mixtral MoE`. Fetch the changelog to find these.]

... [repeat for each step]

N-1. **Export & Deploy** — [merge adapters / export model / package artifacts. For LoRA/QLoRA: MUST include a complete adapter merge script (`model.merge_and_unload()`) that produces a standalone model. For multimodal: verify vision tower is included in the export. This step is NOT optional — an adapter without a merge script is not a deliverable.]
   - Operational monitoring: [GPU persistence mode (`nvidia-smi -pm 1`), ECC error checks (`nvidia-smi --query-gpu=ecc.errors.uncorrected.volatile --format=csv`), health check endpoint, log rotation. Required for any GPU serving plan.]
   - Validate: [load exported model, run inference on test input]
   - Artifacts: [what files are produced, where they go]

N. **Inference Smoke Test** — [complete runnable inference script that loads the MERGED/EXPORTED model (not the adapter) and runs on 2-3 example inputs. For multimodal: include image loading and preprocessing. Must be a standalone function the user can import and call.]

**Deployment completeness gate:** Serving/deployment plans MUST include ALL of: (1) `pip install` with every package and pinned versions, (2) model/artifact download command, (3) server launch command with all flags, (4) health check or readiness probe, (5) smoke test `curl` command or Python client request. Missing any = user cannot reproduce.
   - Code: ```[language]\n[full inference script — load model, run prediction, print output. Not a stub.]\n```
   - Validate: [compare output against expected baseline — exact string or metric threshold]

**Cost tracking requirement**: If the plan makes paid API calls (LLM providers, embedding APIs, reranking services), include a `track_cost()` utility that logs tokens used and estimated cost per stage. Print a running total. Budget overruns are a top user complaint — make costs visible by default.

**VRAM estimate requirement**: The Prerequisites section MUST include a per-GPU VRAM breakdown: `model_params × bytes_per_param + optimizer_states + activation_memory + KV_cache = total`. Show the math, not just the conclusion. If the total exceeds 85% of GPU VRAM, flag it and adjust the config (reduce batch size, add gradient checkpointing, switch precision).

**Post-assembly citation audit (BLOCKING — do this or fail):** Count citations RIGHT NOW. Minimum: 2 per step + 1 per code block (one for the approach, one for a specific API/kwarg). Web mode URLs MUST include `#fragment` or `/path/to/specific-page` — homepage links don't count. Every citation must include a brief quote from the source: `[source](URL) — "exact words from page"`. If ANY step has 0 citations → fetch before presenting. If total citation count < number of steps → you have not grounded the plan. Go back and fetch. Mark truly uncitable steps `[UNVERIFIED — test in dry-run]`. Also verify: every `Class(kwarg=...)` has a citation confirming that kwarg exists in the pinned version, and every kwarg is placed on the correct call site (constructor vs method).

**Grounding density check**: After the citation audit, verify: (1) every `Class(kwarg=...)` cites the docs URL confirming those kwargs exist — cite the **specific version's API page**, not the library homepage, (2) every numerical estimate shows the formula AND cites the benchmark, (3) every model ID cites the model card, (4) every config choice (batch size, learning rate, threshold) cites a doc or benchmark justifying that specific value — not just "standard" or "typical". If any are missing, WebFetch before presenting.

**Launcher note**: Provide launch commands for **both** Slurm (`sbatch`/`srun`) and bare-metal (`torchrun`/`accelerate launch`) when the plan involves multi-node or multi-GPU execution.

**Completeness audit**: Before presenting, verify the plan includes ALL of: (1) data preparation with validation, (2) training/building with error handling, (3) evaluation with numeric thresholds, (4) export/merge of artifacts, (5) inference smoke test with runnable script, (6) deployment artifacts if the plan is for a service (Dockerfile, requirements.txt with pinned versions, environment variables). Any missing stage → add it. An incomplete pipeline wastes more time than a thorough plan.



**Concurrency audit**: If ANY step makes ≥10 independent network calls (LLM judge calls, API requests, batch embeddings), the code MUST use `asyncio.gather` / `concurrent.futures` with a configurable concurrency limit. Serial LLM judge loops over hundreds of samples are unacceptably slow — flag and fix before presenting.

**Specificity audit**: Scan every step for vague language: "adjust as needed", "tune this", "configure appropriately", "use a suitable value". Replace each with a concrete value and show-your-work justification. If you truly cannot determine the value, state the range with a recommended default: `lr=2e-5  # range 1e-5 to 5e-5; 2e-5 is standard for 7B LoRA per [source]`. Also scan for placeholder variables left undefined (e.g., `corpus = ...`, `data = your_data_here`) — either provide a concrete example value or show the exact loading code.

**Throughput/latency claims audit**: Every tokens/sec, latency, or QPS number MUST cite a benchmark source (fetched this session). Format: `~40 tok/s [source](URL#benchmark-section)`. If no benchmark exists for the exact config, state it as a range with upper/lower bounds from the closest benchmarks you did fetch, and mark `[ESTIMATED]`.

### Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: [what could go wrong] → Mitigation: [specific action] [PageID]

### Execution Strategy
- Dry-run: [what to test on 1% of data first]
- Checkpoint: [when to evaluate before continuing]
- Success criteria: [specific metrics with numeric thresholds — e.g., "recall@10 ≥ 0.85 on held-out test set" not just "good retrieval quality"]
```

## After This

Execute in phases: **dry-run on 1% data → 1 epoch → full run.**

- Before running → invoke **ml-verify** to catch config mistakes
- Log the experiment → invoke **ml-experiment** to track hypothesis and results
- If any phase fails → invoke **ml-debug** with the error and plan context
- After results → invoke **ml-iterate** if metrics aren't at target

## Anti-Patterns

| Mistake | Why it happens | What to do instead |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Planning without memory estimation | "We'll figure out OOM at runtime" | Estimate GPU memory in the plan. Include per-step memory budget. |
| Missing evaluation step | "We'll evaluate after training" | Build evaluation into the plan — what metrics, what threshold, what data |
| Wrong parallelism for model size | "Just use FSDP for everything" | Check KB for model-size-specific parallelism recommendations |
| No dry-run phase | "The config looks right" | Always plan a 10-step dry-run before committing GPU hours |
| Skipping review_plan | "build_plan gave a good result" | review_plan catches risks that build_plan misses. Always run both. |
| Custom data pipeline when native exists | "I'll write my own Dataset class" | Use the framework's native data loading first (e.g., LLaVA's pipeline, Axolotl's YAML datasets). Custom only when native can't handle your format. Call `search_knowledge("[framework] native data pipeline")` to confirm the native path before writing custom code. |

| No error handling in execution steps | "We'll deal with errors when they happen" | Every step that calls an API or runs training needs try/except with a recovery action (retry, checkpoint resume, graceful exit). |

| Single-launcher execution scripts | "Everyone uses Slurm" | Provide launcher commands for both Slurm (`srun`/`sbatch`) and bare-metal (`torchrun`) setups. Not all clusters use the same scheduler. |
| String parsing for routing decisions | "I'll use StrOutputParser for yes/no" | Use structured output (Pydantic models, tool calls, or JSON mode) for any LLM decision that controls flow — routing, grading, gating. String parsing breaks on minor output variations. |
| Hardcoded thresholds and magic numbers | "I'll tune them later" | Put thresholds, retry limits, and quality gates in a config file (YAML/JSON) from the start. Hardcoded values resist tuning and A/B testing. |
| Statistical methods with wrong assumptions | "temperature=0 measures self-consistency" | Verify that your methodology actually tests what you claim. Near-deterministic sampling can't measure variance; paired vs pooled statistics answer different questions. State assumptions explicitly in the plan. |
| Unverified model/endpoint names | "rerank-v4.0-pro should exist" | Call `search_knowledge("[provider] [model] available models")` for every model name, endpoint, or API version. If the KB can't confirm it exists, mark it `[UNVERIFIED]` and provide a fallback (e.g., `rerank-v3.5` as known-good). |


| Inconsistent model/config names across steps | "I'll fix it later" / "The user will notice" | After writing all steps, scan for model name, variable name, and config value consistency. If Step 2 says `gpt-4o-mini` and Step 3's code uses `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, that's a bug — fix it before presenting. Budget tables must match the actual API calls in code. |
| Missing edge-case handling in node/step logic | "I mentioned it in the warnings" | Warnings don't fix code. If a retrieval step can return duplicates, the code must deduplicate — `seen = set(); results = [r for r in results if r.id not in seen and not seen.add(r.id)]`. If a score extraction can fail to parse, the code must handle it — `score = int(m.group(1)) if m else DEFAULT_SCORE`. Put the fix IN the code, not in a prose warning. |

| Using QLoRA/4-bit when hardware has headroom | "Quantization is always better" | Estimate model memory at bf16 first: `params × 2 bytes`. If it fits in available VRAM with room for activations, use bf16 + LoRA — it's simpler and avoids quantization artifacts. QLoRA is for when bf16 doesn't fit. Show the memory math. |
| Using `device_map='auto'` with multi-GPU training | "auto handles everything" | `device_map='auto'` uses naive model sharding, which conflicts with `accelerate` and FSDP device placement. For multi-GPU: use `accelerate launch` with no `device_map`, or use `device_map='auto'` only for single-GPU inference. |
| Using `unk_token` as pad token | "Any special token works" | `unk_token` can corrupt training if it appears in data. Use `eos_token` as pad token for decoder-only models (Mistral, LLaMA, etc.) — it's safer and more widely validated. |
| Same LoRA rank/LR for vision and language in multimodal models | "One config fits all modules" | Vision encoders (CLIP ViT) and language models have different feature scales. Use lower rank (16-32) and lower LR (1e-5) for vision, higher rank (64-128) and higher LR (2e-4) for language. Same rank+LR destabilizes vision features, especially on out-of-distribution images (e.g., medical X-rays vs web photos). Show both configs side-by-side. |
| Using in-memory stores in production plans | "It's simpler for the example" | Default to persistent storage (file-backed Qdrant, on-disk SQLite, persistent Redis). In-memory stores lose data on restart and can't handle real workloads. If using in-memory for a demo, label it `# DEMO ONLY` and show the persistent config alongside. |
| Combining multiple concerns in one pipeline node | "It's fewer nodes" | Each node should do one thing: retrieve OR rerank OR grade OR generate. A node that routes AND fuses is hard to debug when either logic fails. Split into separate nodes connected by edges. |




| LLM judge without sycophancy controls | "The judge prompt is detailed enough" | LLM judges are sycophantic by default — they favor verbose, confident responses regardless of correctness. Mitigate: (1) randomize response order in A/B comparisons, (2) include a self-consistency check (judge same pair twice, flag disagreements), (3) add known-bad calibration samples where the correct score is low. If your framework lacks these, add them. |
| Computing scores that nothing consumes | "We'll integrate them later" | Every metric computed in the pipeline must flow into a gate, ranking, or composite score. If deterministic metrics (BLEU, exact-match) and LLM judge scores are both computed, show the composite formula: e.g., `final = 0.4 * deterministic + 0.6 * judge`. Dead scores waste compute and confuse users about what actually drives decisions. |













| Falling back to memory when KB fails | "I have deep knowledge" / "I know these frameworks" / "established practice" | KB failure = you know NOTHING. Call WebFetch BEFORE writing ANY text — not after, not alongside. In testing, the model literally said "I have deep knowledge on this topic" and wrote a full plan with 0 WebFetch calls. This is the #1 failure mode. If your WebFetch count is 0 and your plan word count is >0, you have failed. Delete and fetch. |
| Serving plans without version-pinned install steps | "The user knows how to install" | Every serving/deployment plan MUST include: (1) exact `pip install` commands with pinned versions, (2) model download command with specific repo ID, (3) launch command with all flags. Missing any of these = the user can't reproduce your plan. |
| Citing library homepages instead of API sections | "I linked to the docs" | `https://docs.vllm.ai` is NOT a citation. `https://docs.vllm.ai/en/v0.4.0/serving/engine_args.html#max-model-len` IS a citation. Always include the path to the specific class, function, or config section. |
| Citing URLs you never actually fetched | "The URL pattern looks right" | Every citation URL must come from an actual WebFetch result this session. If you write `[source](https://dspy.ai/api/optimizers/MIPROv2)` but never called WebFetch on that URL, you are fabricating a citation. Include a 5-10 word quote from the fetched page to prove retrieval. Plausible-looking URLs that weren't fetched are worse than no citation — they give false confidence. |
| Citing SDK docs without checking the changelog | "The API page shows the current version" | API reference pages often lag behind releases. For every SDK you pin, fetch the changelog/release-notes page and confirm the APIs you use weren't renamed, deprecated, or moved. One changelog fetch per SDK catches version-specific breaks that API pages miss. |
| Cross-provider API confusion | "Claude probably has the same API as OpenAI" | Every provider has different method names, parameter names, and error types. `stop_reason='refusal'` is OpenAI — Anthropic uses `stop_reason='end_turn'`. `messages.parse()` is OpenAI — Anthropic uses `messages.create()` with `tools` for structured output. ALWAYS WebFetch the specific provider's API docs — NEVER assume one provider mirrors another. |
| Structured output API guessing | "I know how structured output works" | Structured output APIs differ radically: OpenAI uses `response_format` + `client.beta.chat.completions.parse()`, Anthropic uses `tools` with a single tool as schema, Instructor wraps both differently. NEVER write structured output code without fetching the EXACT provider's structured output docs page this session. Verify: (1) the method name, (2) the parameter name for the schema, (3) the response attribute path to the parsed object. If you write `output_format` or `response_schema` without a fetched citation, you have fabricated an API. |

| Agents that decide without data access | "The LLM can figure it out from instructions" | Every agent decision (routing, classification, scoring) needs a concrete data source: a tool call, a context field with real data, or a function. An agent told to "analyze sentiment" without a sentiment tool will guess. Add tools or pre-compute the data and pass it in context. |
| Fabricating runner/entry-point kwargs | "I'm sure Runner.run() accepts error_handlers" | Runner, Orchestrator, and entry-point function kwargs are the MOST frequently fabricated. ALWAYS WebFetch the Runner/entry-point class docs and copy the EXACT signature. Common traps: `agent=` vs `starting_agent=`, `error_handlers` (doesn't exist — use `max_turns` integer), `on_error` callbacks that aren't real params. If a kwarg isn't in the fetched signature, DELETE IT from your code. |
| Vague hyperparameters and thresholds | "The user can tune it" | Every numeric value (learning rate, batch size, threshold, retry count, temperature) needs a concrete default with a one-line justification citing a benchmark or formula. `lr=2e-5 # standard for 7B LoRA, per [source]` not `lr=TUNE_THIS`. |
| Generic doc citations without quotes | "I linked to the docs page" | Every citation must include a 5-10 word verbatim quote from the fetched source proving retrieval. `[source](URL) — "exact words from page"`. A URL without a quote is an unverified guess. |
