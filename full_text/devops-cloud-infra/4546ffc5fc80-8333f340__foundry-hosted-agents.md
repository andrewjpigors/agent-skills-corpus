# Microsoft Foundry Hosted Agents — Reference Guide

Production-tested patterns for deploying hosted agents on Microsoft Foundry.
**Container-based deployment (Dockerfile + unified `azure.yaml` + `azd`) is
GA.** Source-code (`--deploy-mode code`) deployment is a separate, still-preview
surface — see [§ Preview appendix: source-code deploy](#preview-appendix-source-code-deploy-still-preview)
for that path in isolation. Covers the `Agent` + `FoundryChatClient` +
`ResponsesHostServer` (MAF) variant exclusively.

> **⚠️ MAF 1.8.0 recommended — caller-side `FoundryAgent(timeout=...)` knob.**
> Upgrade from 1.6.0 → 1.8.0 to pick up the new HTTP timeout kwarg on the
> caller-side `agent_framework.foundry.FoundryAgent` class (overrides the
> OpenAI-SDK 5s connect / 600s total defaults). All MAF 1.6.0 telemetry
> bundling (`microsoft-opentelemetry` + `opentelemetry-instrumentation-openai-v2`)
> is unchanged. The two MAF 1.8.0 `[BREAKING]` markers (github-copilot
> sub-package internal rename + experimental `Skill` ABC refactor) are
> **non-impact** for hosted-agent code — see [§ MAF 1.8.0 update](#maf-180-update-june-2026).
>
> If you are still on 1.3.x, upgrade directly to 1.8.0 — absorb the 1.4.0
> breaking changes below AND the 1.6.0 telemetry improvements AND the
> 1.8.0 timeout knob in one pass.

## When to Use

- Deploying a custom container agent to Foundry (GA path)
- Debugging hosted agent failures (401, 500, import errors)
- Understanding agent identity + when (rarely) explicit RBAC is needed
- Authoring the unified `azure.yaml` (`azure.ai.project` + `azure.ai.agent` services)
- Blue-green / canary / rollback traffic routing across agent versions
- **Migrating from MAF 1.3.x → 1.4.0** ([§ below](#maf-140-breaking-changes-may-2026))
- **Migrating from the legacy two-file `agent.yaml` + `agent.manifest.yaml`
  contract** — both are gone; a single `azure.yaml` is now the source of truth
  ([§ azure.yaml](#azureyaml-unified-hosted-agent-configuration))

> **Choosing a model?** See [`references/model-selection.md`](references/model-selection.md) for the model / region / capacity / data-residency decision before you `azd provision`.

---

## MAF 1.4.0 breaking changes (May 2026)

> **If upgrading from 1.3.x today, skip to 1.6.0 directly.** The version
> pins below show 1.4.0 for historical accuracy; use the 1.6.0 pins from
> [§ MAF 1.6.0 update](#maf-160-update-may-2026) instead — they absorb
> all 1.4.0 breaking changes AND add gen_ai telemetry.

Azure renamed the Foundry data-plane role from **"Azure AI User"** to
**"Foundry User"** and changed the AAD token audience the SDK requests
from `https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default` to
`https://ai.azure.com/.default`. **`agent-framework-core` 1.4.0**
(2026-05-14, alongside `agent-framework-foundry-hosting` 1.0.0a260514)
is the first SDK that requests the new scope; everything pinned to 1.3.x
or earlier requests the old scope and gets **`401 Unauthorized`** from
the post-rename data plane.

### The three changes you have to absorb

| # | Change | Symptom on pinned 1.3.x | Fix |
|---|--------|------------------------|-----|
| 1 | **AAD token scope:** `cognitiveservices.azure.com` → `ai.azure.com` | Every Responses request → `401 Unauthorized` (with valid `Foundry User` RBAC) | Upgrade to `agent-framework-core~=1.4.0` + `agent-framework-foundry~=1.4.0` + `agent-framework-foundry-hosting==1.0.0a260514` |
| 2 | **Role display name** "Azure AI User" → "Foundry User" | `az role assignment create --role "Azure AI User"` fails with `RoleDefinitionNotFound` | Use `--role "Foundry User"` OR pin by GUID `53ca6127-db72-4b80-b1b0-d745d6d5456d` (unchanged across the rename — the safest call-site form is the GUID) |
| 3 | **`AzureOpenAIChatClient` removed** from `agent_framework.azure` | `ImportError: cannot import name 'AzureOpenAIChatClient'` after `pip install -U` | Use `OpenAIChatClient(azure_endpoint=..., model=..., credential=...)` from `agent_framework.openai` — see snippet below |

### `AzureOpenAIChatClient` → `OpenAIChatClient` migration

`FoundryChatClient` is the right choice for hosted Foundry agents and is
unaffected. The removal hits **adjacent code paths** that talked directly
to Azure OpenAI (eval judges, batch scoring, sidecar services, agents
that route through APIM):

```python
# OLD (MAF 1.3.x — REMOVED in 1.4.0)
from agent_framework.azure import AzureOpenAIChatClient
from azure.identity import get_bearer_token_provider, DefaultAzureCredential
client = AzureOpenAIChatClient(
    endpoint=AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT,
    deployment_name=DEPLOYMENT,
    ad_token_provider=get_bearer_token_provider(
        DefaultAzureCredential(),
        "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default",
    ),
)

# NEW (MAF 1.4.0)
from agent_framework.openai import OpenAIChatClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
client = OpenAIChatClient(
    azure_endpoint=AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT,    # NB: kwarg renamed from `endpoint`
    model=DEPLOYMENT,                         # NB: kwarg renamed from `deployment_name`
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),     # SDK derives the right token scope internally
)
```

Drop the explicit `get_bearer_token_provider` / `ad_token_provider` —
`OpenAIChatClient` now derives the scope itself. The unused
`get_bearer_token_provider` import can be removed.

### Image-tag staleness trap (mandatory read for any pilot that pins by digest)

Hosted agent versions reference the orchestrator container by ACR
image **reference**. There are two common shapes:

- `<acr>.azurecr.io/tl-maf-orchestrator:latest` — re-resolves to the
  newest pushed image on every container start. Auto-picks up MAF
  rebuilds the next time the agent provisions.
- `<acr>.azurecr.io/tl-maf-orchestrator@sha256:abc…` — pinned to a
  specific layer digest. Reproducible, but **frozen at the MAF version
  that was in the image when the digest was computed**.

After a MAF 1.4.0 rebuild, agents using `:latest` work; agents using
`@sha256:…` digests from the 1.3.x era keep hitting the old token scope
and fail. **Re-import every hosted agent version** (or pin by digest to
the freshly-built 1.4.0 image) as part of the upgrade. `azd ai agent
deploy` does this automatically if the YAML references `:latest`.

### Rebuild recipe (copy-paste)

```bash
# 1. Upgrade orchestrator pyproject.toml + regenerate uv.lock
sed -i.bak 's/"agent-framework-core[^"]*"/"agent-framework-core~=1.4.0"/' src/orchestrator/pyproject.toml
sed -i.bak 's/"agent-framework-foundry[^"]*"/"agent-framework-foundry~=1.4.0"/' src/orchestrator/pyproject.toml
sed -i.bak 's/"agent-framework-foundry-hosting[^"]*"/"agent-framework-foundry-hosting==1.0.0a260514"/' src/orchestrator/pyproject.toml
(cd src/orchestrator && uv lock)

# 2. ACR remote build — tag with :latest AND a date-pinned tag for forensics
ACR=tl<your-acr-suffix>
az acr build --registry "$ACR" \
  --image "tl-maf-orchestrator:maf14-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M)" \
  --image "tl-maf-orchestrator:latest" \
  --file src/orchestrator/dockerfile src/orchestrator/

# 3. Re-deploy + re-import each agent so it picks up the fresh image
azd deploy agents
(cd infra/scripts && uv run deploy_job.py)
# Then: azd ai agent show — confirm new image digest under each version
```

> **Why date-pinned tags matter.** `:latest` is fine for the agent
> reference but leaves zero forensic trail in ACR's image history.
> The `maf14-YYYYMMDDHHMM` tag lets you correlate "which agent
> version is running which MAF build?" months later when a regression
> bisect needs it.

## MAF 1.6.0 update (May 2026)

`agent-framework-core` 1.6.0 and `agent-framework-foundry-hosting`
1.0.0a260521 ship with **instrumentation enabled by default**. The
hosting package transitively pulls `azure-ai-agentserver-core>=2.0.0b3`
which depends on `microsoft-opentelemetry>=1.0.0` (resolves to 1.1.0),
bundling all OTel instrumentors:

| Bundled instrumentor | What it captures |
|---|---|
| `opentelemetry-instrumentation-openai-v2==2.3b0` | gen_ai spans: model name, token usage, latency for every OpenAI/Responses call |
| `opentelemetry-instrumentation-openai-agents-v2==0.1.0` | Agent-level invocation spans |
| `opentelemetry-instrumentation-httpx` | HTTP dependency spans |
| `azure-core-tracing-opentelemetry` | Azure SDK call tracing |

### What this means for `container.py`

**Remove all manual OTel code.** No `configure_azure_monitor()`, no
`OpenAIInstrumentor().instrument()`, no custom `TracerProvider`. The
platform handles everything. Your container code only needs:

```python
# Ensure env var is set (deploy.py passthrough for O-012 workaround)
cs = os.getenv("APPLICATION_INSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING") or \
     os.getenv("APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING")
if cs:
    os.environ["APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING"] = cs

# Optionally: SDK-level telemetry setup (after FoundryChatClient creation)
try:
    await client.configure_azure_monitor(enable_sensitive_data=True)
except Exception:
    pass  # Agent works without telemetry
```

### gen_ai spans appear under `cloud_RoleName = "agent_framework"`

**Important for KQL queries:** gen_ai dependency spans use
`cloud_RoleName = "agent_framework"`, NOT `agent-{jobId}-maf`.
Queries filtering `cloud_RoleName startswith "agent-"` will miss them.

```kql
// gen_ai spans — model, tokens, latency
dependencies
| where timestamp > ago(1h)
| where cloud_RoleName == "agent_framework"
| project timestamp, name, duration,
    model=tostring(customDimensions['gen_ai.response.model']),
    input_tokens=tostring(customDimensions['gen_ai.usage.input_tokens']),
    output_tokens=tostring(customDimensions['gen_ai.usage.output_tokens']),
    op=tostring(customDimensions['gen_ai.operation.name'])
| order by timestamp desc
```

### Upgrade recipe (→ 1.7.0)

```bash
sed -i.bak 's/"agent-framework-core[^"]*"/"agent-framework-core~=1.7.0"/' pyproject.toml
sed -i.bak 's/"agent-framework-foundry[^"]*"/"agent-framework-foundry~=1.7.0"/' pyproject.toml
sed -i.bak 's/"agent-framework-foundry-hosting[^"]*"/"agent-framework-foundry-hosting==1.0.0a260528"/' pyproject.toml
# Remove explicit OTel deps — now bundled via hosting package:
# azure-monitor-opentelemetry, opentelemetry-sdk, opentelemetry-instrumentation-*
```

### `create_version` deduplication trap

Foundry deduplicates `create_version` when environment variables and
metadata are **identical** — even if the container image tag/digest
differs. This is SEPARATE from the ACR layer cache trap below. After
a base image rebuild, new code never reaches the container because
Foundry returns the existing version.

**Fix:** Add a changing environment variable to force a new version:
```python
import time
env_vars["_BUILD_TS"] = str(int(time.time()))
```

### ACR layer cache trap (per-job images built via `DockerBuildRequest`)

When per-job images are built via the Azure Container Registry
`DockerBuildRequest` API (e.g., from `deploy.py`), ACR Tasks uses
**layer caching by default**. If the per-job Dockerfile's `COPY . ./`
content hasn't changed (only the base image changed), ACR produces
the **identical digest** — and Foundry deduplicates the
`create_version` call, silently returning the existing version.
New base-image code never reaches the container.

**Fix (both are required):**

1. **`no_cache=True`** on `DockerBuildRequest` — forces ACR to
   rebuild all layers from scratch.
2. **A used `ARG`** in the generated Dockerfile — Docker only
   invalidates cache when an ARG changes AND is consumed:
   ```dockerfile
   ARG BASE_IMAGE=hosted-agent-base-maf:v6
   FROM ${BASE_IMAGE}
   ARG BUILD_TS=1716400000
   RUN echo "build=$BUILD_TS" > /app/.build_ts
   # ... rest of Dockerfile
   ```
   Without the `RUN` line, Docker ignores the ARG for caching.

Discovered May 2026: base image rebuild with `SkillsProvider.from_paths()`
fix + observability fix never reached any agent until both guards were
applied.

## MAF 1.8.0 update (June 2026)

`agent-framework-core` and `agent-framework-foundry` 1.8.x land one
hosted-agent-relevant new knob and two `[BREAKING]` markers — both
non-impact for this skill.

- **`FoundryAgent(timeout=...)`** — new HTTP timeout kwarg on the
  caller-side `agent_framework.foundry.FoundryAgent` class. Overrides
  the underlying OpenAI-SDK default (connect: 5s, total: 600s). Useful
  when orchestrator code calling INTO a hosted agent wants a bounded
  ceiling. See [§ below](#foundryagent-timeout-parameter-maf-180).

### MAF 1.8.0 breaking markers — non-impact analysis

MAF 1.8.0 ships two `[BREAKING]` markers; neither affects hosted-agent code:

1. **`agent-framework-github-copilot` sub-package internal rename** —
   this skill does not pin or import `agent-framework-github-copilot`. **N/A.**
2. **Experimental `Skill` abstract-class refactor in `agent-framework-core`** —
   this skill uses the high-level `SkillsProvider.from_paths(...)` facade
   (see § Skill Loading below), not the experimental `Skill` ABC.
   Hosted-agent containers continue to work unchanged. **Non-impact.**

### FoundryAgent timeout parameter (MAF 1.8.0)

MAF 1.8.0 adds `timeout: float | None = None` to
`agent_framework.foundry.FoundryAgent.__init__`. This is an **HTTP-layer
timeout** that overrides the OpenAI SDK's default (connect: 5s, total: 600s)
for ALL requests made by this agent instance. Per the upstream docstring:
*"HTTP timeout in seconds for requests. When not provided, the OpenAI SDK
default is used (connect: 5s, total: 600s)."*

Use it to:

- **Lower the ceiling** for short-running agents that should fail fast
  (e.g. `timeout=30` for tool-routing agents with user-facing chat budgets).
- **Raise the ceiling** for long-running agents where 600s isn't enough
  (e.g. `timeout=1800` for multi-step research loops).

Scope note: this kwarg lives on the CALLER-side `FoundryAgent` class
(orchestrator code calling a hosted agent). The CONTAINER-side runtime
covered by [§ Runtime Pattern](#runtime-pattern-maf-variant) uses
`FoundryChatClient` directly and does NOT accept `timeout=` in 1.8.0 —
apply HTTP-layer transport timeouts on the underlying client instead.

> **MUST:** Copy verbatim from
> [`references/python/foundry_agent_timeout.py`](references/python/foundry_agent_timeout.py).
> Do NOT redefine inline — the validator enforces single-source-of-truth.

> **See also (MAF 1.8.0, experimental):**
> - `AgentFileStore` — new abstract base class for agent file-management
>   backends. Re-exported as `from agent_framework import AgentFileStore`.
>   Concrete implementations + usage patterns live in `foundry-memory` and
>   `foundry-toolbox`. NOT consumed by the hosted-agents runtime patterns
>   documented in this skill.

### Upgrade recipe (→ 1.8.0)

```bash
sed -i.bak 's/"agent-framework-core[^"]*"/"agent-framework-core~=1.8.0"/' pyproject.toml
sed -i.bak 's/"agent-framework-foundry[^"]*"/"agent-framework-foundry~=1.8.0"/' pyproject.toml
sed -i.bak 's/"agent-framework-foundry-hosting[^"]*"/"agent-framework-foundry-hosting==1.0.0a260528"/' pyproject.toml
# Telemetry bundling from MAF 1.6.0 is unchanged in 1.8.0 — no other deps to touch.
```

Note: the hosting package is pinned **exact** (`==1.0.0a260528`), not
compatible-release (`~=`). PEP 440 treats `~=1.0.0aN` as
`>=1.0.0aN, <1.1` — pip will happily drift to a later alpha
(`a260609`, `a260612`, …). Exact pin per AGENTS.md § 9.5 alpha
pre-release discipline.

## Container GA status and adjacent preview surfaces

> **Status.** **Container-based** hosted agent deploy (Dockerfile +
> unified `azure.yaml` + `azd`) is **GA** — that is the stable path
> documented throughout the rest of this skill. Container deploy was
> still labelled preview as recently as the March 2026 announcement
> blog; treat "GA" as current as of this skill's `last_validated` date
> in [`references/upstream-pin.md`](references/upstream-pin.md), not as
> a permanently-fixed fact — re-check the sources below if it's been a
> while.
>
> A few adjacent surfaces remain preview or partial-GA and are called
> out explicitly wherever they appear in this skill, rather than
> assumed GA by association:
>
> - **Source-code deploy** (`--deploy-mode code`, ZIP upload, no
>   Dockerfile) is preview — isolated in its own
>   [§ Preview appendix](#preview-appendix-source-code-deploy-still-preview)
>   at the end of this file. Do not mix its guidance into the container
>   (GA) path documented above it.
> - **A2A protocol** and **Voice Live** are each preview, independently
>   of the container/Responses GA surface — see `foundry-toolbox` and
>   `foundry-voice-live` respectively for those contracts.
> - **Hosted tracing** (distributed traces / gen_ai spans in App
>   Insights) is partial GA / preview depending on the exact signal —
>   see `foundry-observability` for the current split.
> - **Agent guardrails** (content-safety toggle), **Optimizer**,
>   **Routines**, and **Memory** all remain preview surfaces layered on
>   top of the GA hosted-agent runtime — see their owning skills
>   (`foundry-routines`, `foundry-memory`) for details; this skill does
>   not restate their contracts.
>

### Built-in content-safety toggle (preview)

Content safety is a **Foundry portal toggle** under the **Guardrails**
blade of the agent resource — not an SDK call, not an `azure.yaml`
field. Toggle on to enable platform-side prompt/response filtering with
the project's default content-safety policy. Toggle off if you bring
your own filtering layer upstream (e.g., APIM policy fragment, in-agent
middleware). Guardrails remain a **preview** capability layered on the
GA hosted-agent runtime.

The toggle is per-agent, per-environment. Production environments
should turn it ON by default; dev environments may turn it off to
test prompt patterns that would otherwise be blocked.

### Responses, Invocations, Invocations (WebSocket), and Activity

Hosted agent containers can expose one or more protocols side by side.
Per Microsoft Learn: *"The Responses, Invocations, and Invocations
(WebSocket) protocols are available in all regions that support Hosted
agents."* — none of the three is region-restricted.

| Protocol | Python library | Use for |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| `responses` | `azure-ai-agentserver-responses` | Conversational chatbots, streaming, multi-turn with platform-managed history. This skill's primary pattern. |
| `invocations` | `azure-ai-agentserver-invocations` | Webhook receivers, non-conversational processing, custom async workflows. |
| `invocations_ws` | `azure-ai-agentserver-invocations` (same package, WebSocket route) | Bidirectional streaming — real-time voice agents, interactive media. Documented here; **not exercised by this skill's fixture**, which only drives Responses. |
| Activity (auto-bridge) | n/a — platform-managed | Foundry automatically bridges Responses to the Bot Framework Activity protocol for Teams / Microsoft 365 Copilot publishing. No code change on the agent side. Publishing setup itself is out of scope for this skill — see `foundry-teams-bot` / the Teams publishing backlog for that contract. |

Declare the protocols a container serves in the `protocols` list of the
`azure.ai.agent` service in `azure.yaml` (§ below) — a single container
can serve multiple protocols simultaneously by importing the matching
libraries.

### Unified `azure.yaml` (replaces the old two-file contract)

The old **two-file** contract (`agent.yaml` literal values +
`agent.manifest.yaml` mustache scaffold) is gone. As of the current
Foundry `azd` extensions, **all hosted-agent configuration lives in a
single `azure.yaml`** — see
[§ azure.yaml (unified hosted-agent configuration)](#azureyaml-unified-hosted-agent-configuration)
below for the canonical shape. If you're migrating an older project,
delete `agent.yaml` and `agent.manifest.yaml` and move their content
into the `azure.ai.agent` service block.

### Hosting SDK matrix (Python)

| Framework | Hosting package | Server class |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| MAF | `agent-framework-foundry-hosting` | `agent_framework_foundry_hosting.ResponsesHostServer` |
| BYO Responses | `azure-ai-agentserver-responses` | `azure.ai.agentserver.responses.ResponsesHostServer` |
| BYO Invocations (WS) | `azure-ai-agentserver-invocations` | `azure.ai.agentserver.invocations.InvocationsHostServer` |
| LangGraph | `langchain-azure-ai[hosting]` | `langchain_azure_ai.agents.hosting.ResponsesHostServer` |

Pin to the MAF row unless you have a documented reason to use one of
the BYO packages (custom protocol handler, non-MAF framework lock-in,
LangGraph state-graph requirements).

## Runtime Pattern (MAF Variant)

> **Model selection (verified across recent pilots).** Default
> to **`gpt-5.4`** for production agents that run instruction chains
> with 10+ tool steps (case investigation, multi-source RAG synthesis,
> regulatory drafting). Use **`gpt-5.4-mini`** only for trivial
> 1-2-step flows (single-tool lookups, formatters). The mini variant's
> tool-call discipline degrades sharply on long chains: in recent
> strict-smoke reproducibility on a 7-skill flow went from **1/3** with
> gpt-5.4-mini to **3/3** with gpt-5.4 (same MCP server, same prompts).
> The mini variant tends to call commit-style tools before evidence is
> gathered — partially mitigated by the validate-or-reject pattern in
> `foundry-mcp-aca`, but gpt-5.4 still fixes the root cause.
>
> **Cost/latency note.** `gpt-5.4` GlobalStandard at 50 capacity costs
> a few cents per scenario at idle the deployment ticks negligibly,
> so the typical pilot cost is dominated by the scenarios you actually
> run. Don't downgrade to mini just to save on the deployment standby.
>
> **Full model catalog.** For the complete May 2026 Foundry model selector
> (task/modality tables, region availability tiers, embeddings, rerank,
> image/video gen, Document AI, audio), see the
> [`agentic-loop` skill](https://github.com/aiappsgbb/agentic-loop) §
> "Foundry Model Selector". That table is the single source of truth for
> model selection across all awesome-gbb skills — we don't duplicate it here.

> **MUST:** Copy verbatim from [`references/python/main.py`](references/python/main.py). Do NOT redefine inline — the validator enforces single-source-of-truth. That file is the field-validated `FoundryChatClient` + `Agent` + `ResponsesHostServer` shape for a single-purpose hosted agent (one tool, no `SkillsProvider`, MAF 1.6.0).

**Key points (why each line in `main.py` matters):**
- `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` is **injected by the platform** — never declare in `azure.yaml`
- `default_options={"store": False}` — hosting platform manages conversation history
- `ResponsesHostServer` handles liveness/readiness probes natively
- `DefaultAzureCredential` resolves to the agent's dedicated Entra identity
- Custom tools use `@tool(approval_mode="never_require")` with `Annotated` type hints

**Canonical reference files for the rest of this skill** (each one is the source of truth for its § below; SKILL.md prose never re-defines these):

| Reference file | Consumed by § |
|---|---|
| [`references/python/main.py`](references/python/main.py) | § Runtime Pattern (MAF Variant) |
| [`references/python/container.py`](references/python/container.py) | § Skill Loading — `SkillsProvider` (multi-SKILL composition + guarded `_init_telemetry()`) |
| [`references/python/pyproject.toml`](references/python/pyproject.toml) | § Dependencies (pyproject.toml) |
| [`references/docker/Dockerfile`](references/docker/Dockerfile) | § Dependencies (pyproject.toml) → Dockerfile |
| [`references/yaml/azure.yaml`](references/yaml/azure.yaml) | § azure.yaml (unified hosted-agent configuration) — the single source of truth for hosted-agent config, replacing the old `agent.yaml` + `agent.manifest.yaml` two-file contract |
| [`references/python/version_rollout.py`](references/python/version_rollout.py) | § Version rollout patterns (blue-green / canary / rollback) |

> **⚠️ Deprecation: `ChatAgent` is gone in MAF 1.6.0**
>
> Any older examples showing `from agent_framework import ChatAgent` followed by `ChatAgent(chat_client=...)` are **stale — no migration alias is exported**. The class was renamed to `Agent` and the kwarg changed from `chat_client=` to `client=`. If you're copying code from pre-May-2026 prose or SKILLs, replace `ChatAgent(chat_client=client, ...)` with `Agent(client=client, ...)`.

### Skill Loading — `SkillsProvider` (recommended) vs. inline `_load_skills()` (legacy)

> **Authoritative source.** [Microsoft Agent Framework — Agent Skills (Python)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/agents/skills?pivots=programming-language-python).

#### ⚠️ Separation of concerns (read this first)

When `SkillsProvider` is wired, `_load_instructions()` MUST contain **only**
the baseline orchestration prompt (`copilot-instructions.md`) plus
SPEC-derived constants (`config.json`: thresholds, enums, templates).

It MUST NOT also concat `SKILL.md` content. `SkillsProvider` advertises
each skill in ~100 tokens, then the agent calls `load_skill(name)` on
demand. Concatenating both **double-counts** every skill body, blows
out the static prompt, and silently defeats progressive disclosure.

#### Recommended — `SkillsProvider` context provider

> **⚠️ DO and DO NOT — API change in MAF 1.4.0 / 1.6.0:**
>
> - **DO** use `SkillsProvider.from_paths(skills_dir)` (MAF 1.6.0 recommended, works on 1.4.0+)
> - **DO NOT** use the legacy `SkillsProvider(skill_paths=skills_dir)` constructor — it was **removed in MAF 1.4.0** with no alias
>
> If you see `TypeError: SkillsProvider.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'skill_paths'` at container startup, replace `SkillsProvider(skill_paths=...)` with `SkillsProvider.from_paths(...)` immediately.

Defensive-init helper. The agent stays runnable with `context_providers=[]`
even if the skills directory is missing or a `SKILL.md` is malformed —
critical for ops, since a single broken skill file should not crash the
container at startup.

> **MUST:** Copy verbatim from [`references/python/container.py`](references/python/container.py). Do NOT redefine inline — the validator enforces single-source-of-truth. That file ships the canonical `_init_telemetry()` (guarded against O-012 AppIn injection failures) + `_build_skills_provider()` (returns `None` on missing/corrupt skills dir so the agent stays runnable) + the full `FoundryChatClient` / `Agent` / `ResponsesHostServer` wiring for a multi-SKILL hosted agent.
>
> **The pattern in one line:** `context_providers=[skills_provider] if skills_provider else []` on the `Agent(...)` ctor — and `instructions=_load_instructions()` returns base prompt + SPEC config ONLY (never concatenate `SKILL.md` bodies; that double-counts and defeats progressive disclosure).

**Constructor variants.**
- `SkillsProvider.from_paths(skills_dir)` — classmethod, the form used in
  production hosted agents. **Use this.**
- ~~`SkillsProvider(skill_paths=skills_dir)`~~ — **REMOVED in MAF 1.4.0.**
  Causes `TypeError: SkillsProvider.__init__() got an unexpected keyword
  argument 'skill_paths'` → container crashes before readiness → sticky
  `session_not_ready` on every invocation. Always use `from_paths()`.

The provider searches up to two levels deep, so `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
and `skills/<group>/<name>/SKILL.md` layouts are both auto-discovered.

**Per-query cost.** `SkillsProvider` adds **+1 `load_skill` tool call per
skill the agent activates per query** (typically 1-3 per query). This is
**NOT** the 20-34-internal-call overhead seen on `CopilotClient` runs —
that overhead lives in `CopilotClient` itself and is unrelated to
`SkillsProvider`.

**Quantified benefits** (from production MAF deployments):
- **~75% token saving** on the static prompt vs. concatenating all
  `SKILL.md` bodies into instructions.
- **Per-skill App Insights telemetry** — every `load_skill(name)` is a
  traceable tool-call span, so routing analysis (which skills get used?
  which never load? which load on the wrong intent?) is free.

#### Legacy alternative — inline `_load_skills()` concat

The pre-`SkillsProvider` pattern: read every `skills/*/SKILL.md` at
startup and append the bodies to the system prompt. Still supported,
still works, occasionally still the right choice.

```python
def _load_skills() -> str:
    chunks: list[str] = []
    skills_dir = Path(__file__).parent / "skills"
    for skill_file in sorted(skills_dir.glob("*/SKILL.md")):
        chunks.append(
            f"\n\n---\n\n# Skill: {skill_file.parent.name}\n\n"
            + skill_file.read_text(encoding="utf-8")
        )
    return "".join(chunks)


def _load_instructions_legacy() -> str:
    base = (Path(__file__).parent / "copilot-instructions.md").read_text(encoding="utf-8")
    return f"{base}\n\n{_load_skills()}"


agent = Agent(
    client=client,
    instructions=_load_instructions_legacy(),   # everything baked into the prompt
    tools=[my_tool, mcp_tool],
    # context_providers omitted — skills already in instructions
    default_options={"store": False},
)
```

#### When to choose which

| | `SkillsProvider` (recommended) | `_load_skills()` concat (legacy) |
|---|---|---|
| Per-query overhead | +1 `load_skill` per skill loaded (1-3/query typical) | None |
| Static prompt size | ~100 tokens/skill advertised | Full SKILL.md bodies always present |
| Total skill content >5 KB | ✅ recommended | ⚠️ blows up context budget every turn |
| Strict latency budget (sub-2s tools) | ⚠️ adds `load_skill` round-trip | ✅ faster cold path |
| Per-skill usage telemetry | ✅ free (every `load_skill` is a span) | ❌ invisible |
| New PoCs | ✅ default | only if total skill content is small (<5 KB) |
| Mixing both | ❌ never — double-counts every skill body | n/a |

#### Centralizing skills via the Foundry Skills REST API

The patterns above all assume `SKILL.md` files live in the agent's source
tree. If multiple Hosted agents in the same project need to share a
canonical set of `SKILL.md` files (without each repo carrying its own
copy), publish them to the project-level **Foundry Skills** store
(`{project}/skills`) and consume them via either:

- **Build-time bundle** — `azd predeploy` hook downloads all published
  skills into `src/skills/` so the standard `SkillsProvider.from_paths(…)`
  above keeps working unchanged.
- **Runtime fetch** — `SkillsProvider(source=FoundrySkillsSource(…))` with
  a custom `SkillsSource` that pulls from the REST API on session create.

See **`foundry-skill-catalog`** for the REST surface, the silent
JSON-mode-is-write-only trap, and the verified-working `FoundrySkillsSource`
adapter.

### Multi-Agent: Calling Other Foundry Agents as Tools

Use the **client-swap pattern** to connect to existing prompt/hosted agents in the same project:

```python
from agent_framework import Agent
from agent_framework.foundry import FoundryChatClient
from azure.ai.projects.aio import AIProjectClient  # MUST be .aio (async)!
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

project_client = AIProjectClient(
    endpoint=os.environ["FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT"],
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
)

# Create FoundryChatClient, swap its OpenAI client to the agent-bound one
sub_client = FoundryChatClient(project_client=project_client, model="gpt-5.4-mini")
sub_client.client = project_client.get_openai_client(agent_name="my-sub-agent")

sub_agent = Agent(name="my-sub-agent", client=sub_client)

orchestrator = Agent(
    client=FoundryChatClient(
        project_endpoint=os.environ["FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT"],
        model="gpt-5.4-mini",
        credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
    ),
    instructions="You orchestrate sub-agents.",
    tools=[sub_agent.as_tool()],
    default_options={"store": False},
)

ResponsesHostServer(orchestrator).run()
```

**Critical rules:**
- `AIProjectClient` MUST be from `azure.ai.projects.aio` (async) — the sync version returns a sync `OpenAI` client that **silently fails** inside `FoundryChatClient`
- `allow_preview=True` is **not required** for `agent_name`-based `get_openai_client()` — verified against `azure-ai-projects` 2.3.0: the base-URL / query-param resolution the SDK uses for the agent endpoint doesn't gate on `allow_preview` (the constructor docstring is stale on this point; the actual code path isn't). Only opt into `allow_preview=True` if you need a genuinely preview surface (e.g. `project.beta.*` operations).
- `FoundryChatClient` does NOT accept `agent_name`/`agent_version` — use the client-swap pattern

mcp_tool = client.get_mcp_tool(
    name="my-mcp",

    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {long_lived_or_api_key}"},
    approval_mode="never_require",
)

```

### MCP Tools — recommended pattern (`MCPStreamableHTTPTool` + `parse_tool_results`)

Use `MCPStreamableHTTPTool` directly with a custom `parse_tool_results`
callback that extracts the `TextContent.text` payload from the MCP
`CallToolResult` and surfaces it to the model as plain JSON. This
sidesteps `FoundryChatClient.get_mcp_tool()` entirely and avoids the
`[<Content object>]` repr leak.

**Worked example** — validated in recent pilots, running on a
10-tool MCP server with `gpt-5.4-mini`:

```python
import json
from agent_framework import Agent, MCPStreamableHTTPTool, tool
from agent_framework.foundry import FoundryChatClient
from agent_framework_foundry_hosting import ResponsesHostServer
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential


def _mcp_text_extractor(result):
    """Convert an MCP CallToolResult into the plain JSON string the model expects.

    Without this callback, agent_framework's default rendering of MCP results
    leaks the Python repr of `[<Content object>]` into the model's view, which
    gpt-5.4-mini reads as a tool failure. We surface the first TextContent
    payload (which the MCP server returns as `json.dumps(...)`) verbatim.
    """
    if getattr(result, "isError", False):
        return json.dumps({
            "error": "mcp_tool_error",
            "content": [str(c) for c in (result.content or [])],
        })
    for c in result.content or []:
        text = getattr(c, "text", None)
        if isinstance(text, str) and text:
            return text
    sc = getattr(result, "structuredContent", None)
    if sc is not None:
        return json.dumps(sc, default=str)
    return json.dumps({"_empty": True})


client = FoundryChatClient(
    project_endpoint=os.environ["FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT"],
    model=os.environ["AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"],
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
)

mcp_tool = MCPStreamableHTTPTool(
    name="<process>_mcp",
    url=f"https://{os.environ['MCP_SERVER_FQDN']}/mcp",
    approval_mode="never_require",
    parse_tool_results=_mcp_text_extractor,   # ⚠️ THE FIX — opts out of default rendering
    request_timeout=60,
)

agent = Agent(client=client, tools=[my_local_tool, mcp_tool], ...)
```

**Why this works:**
- `MCPStreamableHTTPTool` is the lower-level MAF primitive that
  `client.get_mcp_tool()` wraps — bypassing the wrapper avoids the
  buggy renderer.
- `parse_tool_results` is invoked by MAF on every tool result before
  it's rendered into the model's history; returning a plain string
  makes that string what the model sees verbatim.
- The MCP server should return `json.dumps(...)` from each tool
  handler (FastMCP wraps it as a single `TextContent`); the extractor
  unwraps that back to the JSON string.

**When pure-compute logic doesn't need to be on the MCP server,
inline it as `@tool`.** The MCP-vs-`@tool` rule from recent pilots:
- **MCP server** for any tool with I/O (DB lookups, file reads,
  external API calls).
- **Inline `@tool`** for pure computation (date math, formatting,
  validation) — cheaper round-trip, no HTTP hop.

**Probe to verify the fix is in place** — dump the raw
`custom_tool_call_output` from a real Foundry trace; the `output`
field should be a plain JSON string (e.g. `{"case_id":"...","status":"..."}`),
NOT `[<agent_framework._types.Content object at 0x...>]`. Your
process repo should ship `tests/probe_mcp_output.py` for this.

### MCP with per-call AAD bearer (`header_provider`)

> routes" → Route B for the canonical pattern.

For MCP servers backed by Azure services that authenticate with
Microsoft Entra ID **where bootstrap does NOT require auth** (e.g.
some custom MCP servers that auth-gate per-tool but allow open
discovery), use the `header_provider` callback to mint a fresh
bearer token per tool invocation. Per the SDK's own docstring, the
callback "receives the runtime keyword arguments" — a generic
`dict[str, Any]` populated by MAF at tool-invoke time — and returns
a `dict[str, str]` of HTTP headers attached to every outbound request
during that tool call.

```python
import os
from agent_framework import MCPStreamableHTTPTool
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

# Module-level singleton so the in-memory token cache is reused across
# MCP calls; get_token() returns a cached token if it's valid for >= ~5 min
_credential: DefaultAzureCredential | None = None

def _get_credential() -> DefaultAzureCredential:
    global _credential
    if _credential is None:
        _credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
    return _credential

def _bearer_headers(_kwargs: dict) -> dict[str, str]:
    """MAF header_provider — mints a fresh AAD bearer per MCP call.
    Cached by the credential layer; refreshed automatically on expiry.
    """
    tok = _get_credential().get_token("https://search.azure.com/.default")
    return {"Authorization": f"Bearer {tok.token}"}

kb_mcp = MCPStreamableHTTPTool(
    name="my_kb_mcp",
    url=f"{os.environ['AI_SEARCH_ENDPOINT']}/knowledgebases/<kb-name>/mcp"
        f"?api-version=2025-11-01-preview",
    approval_mode="never_require",
    parse_tool_results=_mcp_text_extractor,   # same extractor as above
    header_provider=_bearer_headers,           # 🔑 per-call refresh
    request_timeout=60,
)
```

#### Companion: `httpx.Auth` for AAD-bootstrap-required MCPs (CANONICAL)

When the MCP endpoint authenticates `initialize` / `tools/list` (any
Azure AI Search KB MCP, any PMI-protected MCP), supply auth at the
`httpx` transport layer instead — `httpx.Auth.auth_flow()` is invoked
on EVERY outbound request including bootstrap, so the agent's MCP
handshake completes successfully:

```python
import os, httpx
from agent_framework import MCPStreamableHTTPTool
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

_credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

class _AADBearerAuth(httpx.Auth):
    """Mints AAD bearer per request — covers MCP bootstrap, not just call_tool."""
    def __init__(self, scope: str) -> None:
        self.scope = scope
    def auth_flow(self, request: httpx.Request):
        token = _credential.get_token(self.scope).token
        request.headers["Authorization"] = f"Bearer {token}"
        yield request

_http = httpx.AsyncClient(
    auth=_AADBearerAuth("https://search.azure.com/.default"),
    timeout=120.0,
)

kb_mcp = MCPStreamableHTTPTool(
    name="my_kb_mcp",
    url=(f"{os.environ['AI_SEARCH_ENDPOINT']}/knowledgebases/<kb-name>/mcp"
         f"?api-version=2025-11-01-preview"),
    http_client=_http,            # 🔑 auth covers BOOTSTRAP, not just call_tool
    parse_tool_results=_mcp_text_extractor,
    load_prompts=False,           # avoid prompts/list 500s on KB MCP
    request_timeout=120,
)
```

### File Generation (@tool pattern)

Agents can generate downloadable files (XLSX, PDF, CSV, HTML) using a custom `@tool`.
Files are written to `$HOME` inside the container; the hosting platform exposes them
via the session files API, and the Teams bot delivers them via FileConsentCard
(see [foundry-teams-bot skill](../foundry-teams-bot/SKILL.md#sending-files-to-teams)).

```python
@tool(approval_mode="never_require")
def save_report(
    filename: Annotated[str, Field(description="Filename (e.g. report.xlsx, summary.pdf)")],
    content: Annotated[str, Field(description="File content: CSV text, JSON for XLSX, HTML for pdf")],
    format: Annotated[str, Field(description="Format: csv, xlsx, html, or pdf")] = "csv",
) -> str:
    """Save a report file that the user can download."""
    from pathlib import Path
    home = Path.home()
    filepath = home / filename

    if format == "xlsx":
        import openpyxl
        import json as _json
        data = _json.loads(content)
        wb = openpyxl.Workbook()
        ws = wb.active
        if data and isinstance(data, list):
            ws.append(list(data[0].keys()))
            for row in data:
                ws.append(list(row.values()))
        wb.save(str(filepath))
    elif format == "pdf":
        from fpdf import FPDF
        import re
        # Strip CSS but keep structural HTML for write_html()
        cleaned = re.sub(r"<style[^>]*>.*?</style>", "", content, flags=re.DOTALL)
        cleaned = re.sub(r'\s+(class|style|id)="[^"]*"', "", cleaned)
        cleaned = cleaned.replace("<table", '<table border="1" width="100%"')
        cleaned = cleaned.replace("<th", '<th bgcolor="#d0d0d0"')
        pdf = FPDF()
        pdf.set_auto_page_break(auto=True, margin=15)
        pdf.add_page()
        pdf.set_font("Helvetica", "", 10)
        pdf.write_html(cleaned)
        pdf.output(str(filepath))
    else:
        filepath.write_text(content, encoding="utf-8")

    return f"Report saved: {filename} ({filepath.stat().st_size:,} bytes). User can download it."
```

**Required dependencies** in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
dependencies = [
    # ... agent-framework packages ...
    "openpyxl>=3.1.0",   # XLSX generation
    "fpdf2>=2.8.0",      # PDF generation (pure Python, no system deps)

## Report Generation

You have a `save_report` tool for generating downloadable files:
- **XLSX**: JSON array of objects → `save_report(filename="report.xlsx", content=json_data, format="xlsx")`
- **PDF**: HTML content → `save_report(filename="report.pdf", content=html, format="pdf")`
- **CSV**: Raw CSV text → `save_report(filename="report.csv", content=csv, format="csv")`
- **HTML**: HTML content → `save_report(filename="report.html", content=html, format="html")`
```

**Key points:**
- `fpdf2` is pure Python — no Playwright, wkhtmltopdf, or headless Chrome needed
- `fpdf2.write_html()` renders HTML tables with borders and header highlighting
- Files written to `Path.home()` are automatically available via the session files API
- The bot captures `agent_session_id` from the `response.completed` event to locate files
- Wrap each format in try/except to return a clean error if generation fails

> **Validated** — XLSX and PDF file delivery tested end-to-end in recent
> file-delivery pilots. FileConsentCard renders clickable OneDrive cards in Teams.

## Dependencies (pyproject.toml)

> **🔴 DO NOT** install the `agent-framework` meta-package with `>=`. Pin individual sub-packages:
> ```
> agent-framework-core~=1.11.0
> agent-framework-foundry~=1.10.1
> agent-framework-foundry-hosting==1.0.0a260709
> ```
> The meta-package pulls transitive deps that may conflict. Pin what you need.

> 🚨 **READ FIRST.** Three pyproject mistakes silently break this stack:
>
> 1. **`agent-framework>=1.11.0` meta-package** — non-deterministic transitive resolution; resolves differently across uv versions. **DO** pin `agent-framework-core` and `agent-framework-foundry` individually.
> 2. **`agent-framework-core[mcp]` extra** — that extra **does NOT exist**. `MCPStreamableHTTPTool` / `MCPSseTool` / `MCPStdioTool` are top-level exports of `agent_framework`; the bare `agent-framework-core~=1.11.0` pin already includes them. Writing `[mcp]` produces a uv warning but does NOT fail resolution, so the pyproject can ship looking "MCP-ready" while operators chase phantom problems.
> 3. **Missing `mcp`** — `agent_framework_foundry_hosting._responses` imports `from mcp import McpError` at module-load time, so the container crashes at startup with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp'` even when no MCP tool is wired. The platform surfaces this as `session_not_ready` after a ~60 s timeout, so diagnosis cost is high. Pin `mcp~=1.28.1` in **every** hosted-agent `pyproject.toml`.

> **MUST:** Copy verbatim from [`references/python/pyproject.toml`](references/python/pyproject.toml). Do NOT redefine inline — the validator enforces single-source-of-truth. That file pins `agent-framework-core~=1.11.0`, `agent-framework-foundry~=1.10.1`, the alpha hosting at exact `==1.0.0a260709`, `mcp~=1.28.1` (mandatory — see READ FIRST callout above), `python-dotenv~=1.2.2`, and `azure-identity~=1.25.3`. The header comment captures the three pitfalls (meta-package, phantom `[mcp]` extra, missing `mcp`) the file prevents.

**Do NOT use `agent-framework>=1.11.0` as a meta-package.** The meta-package's transitive
resolution is non-deterministic across uv versions. Pin `agent-framework-core~=1.11.0` and
`agent-framework-foundry~=1.10.1` (PEP 440 compatible-release caps) instead, and pin the
alpha hosting package by exact version `==1.0.0a260709` — pre-release cap math doesn't
survive across alpha boundaries, so `~=` would silently jump to a later alpha (this is a
recurring policy bug in this skill's own pin-validation script — see
[`references/upstream-pin.md`](references/upstream-pin.md) for the fix). Verified
working on linux/amd64 as the current reference shape.

**Simplified deps.** The hosting package bundles `microsoft-opentelemetry`
which transitively pulls ALL OTel instrumentors (openai-v2, agents-v2, httpx, logging,
fastapi, etc.) and the Azure Monitor exporter. **Remove** any explicit
`azure-monitor-opentelemetry`, `opentelemetry-sdk`, `opentelemetry-instrumentation-*`
lines from your pyproject — they are now transitive and declaring them explicitly causes
version conflicts.

**Mandatory adjacent rules** (lessons from dependency-resolution retrospectives):
- **Drop** any explicit `azure-ai-agentserver-responses` line — `agent-framework-foundry-hosting`
  pins the right transitive itself; declaring it explicitly causes uv to resolve a stack that
  passes install but crashes at first invocation with opaque `server_error/model:""`.
- **Add** explicit `mcp~=1.28.1` — **mandatory**, not conditional. `agent_framework_foundry_hosting._responses`
  imports `from mcp import McpError` unconditionally (module-level), so the container crashes
  at startup with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp'` even when the agent uses no MCP
  tools. The platform surfaces this as `session_not_ready` after a ~60 s timeout (not as an
  import error), so the diagnosis cost is high — pin `mcp` in **every** hosted-agent
  `pyproject.toml`. Verified on `agent-framework-foundry-hosting==1.0.0a260709`.
- **Do NOT write `agent-framework-core[mcp]`.** The `[mcp]` extra does NOT exist in
  `agent-framework-core` (PEP 503 / `setup.cfg` of the published wheel has no
  `[project.optional-dependencies] mcp = […]` entry). `MCPStreamableHTTPTool` /
  `MCPSseTool` / `MCPStdioTool` are **top-level exports** of `agent_framework` — pin
  `agent-framework-core~=1.11.0` (plain, no extras) and import them with
  `from agent_framework import MCPStreamableHTTPTool`. Writing the non-existent extra
  produces a uv warning but does **not** fail resolution, so a pyproject can ship looking
  "MCP-ready" while actually missing nothing (the transports are already there) — but the
  warning suggests something's wrong and operators chase the wrong thing.
- **Include** `[tool.setuptools] packages = []` for clean uv resolution.

**`prerelease = "if-necessary-or-explicit"` is correct** — packages with explicit
prerelease markers (e.g. `==1.0.0a260709`) resolve to prereleases; everything else
stays GA. Do NOT use `"allow"` — it can pull an unpinned beta `azure-identity`.

### Dependency Chain (verified on PyPI)

| Package | Version | Type | Pulls in |
|---------|---------|------|----------|
| `agent-framework-core` | 1.11.0 | ✅ Stable | pydantic, opentelemetry-api (instrumentation enabled by default) |
| `agent-framework-foundry` | 1.10.1 | ✅ Stable | core, openai, azure-ai-projects |
| `agent-framework-foundry-hosting` | 1.0.0a260709 | ⚠️ Alpha (pinned exact) | agentserver-core, agentserver-responses (transitive — pinned by the hosting alpha). **agentserver-core** pulls **microsoft-opentelemetry** (bundles all OTel instrumentors + exporters) |
| `mcp` | ~=1.28.1 | ✅ Stable | **Required by every hosted agent** — `agent_framework_foundry_hosting._responses` imports `from mcp import McpError` unconditionally, even when no MCP tools are used. Not auto-pulled by core |
| `azure-identity` | ~=1.25.3 | ✅ Stable | |

No `override-dependencies` needed — the hosting package pins its own transitive deps.

### Dockerfile

> **MUST:** Copy verbatim from [`references/docker/Dockerfile`](references/docker/Dockerfile). Do NOT redefine inline — the validator enforces single-source-of-truth. That file is the canonical, field-validated container image for a hosted agent (uv-based dependency sync, port 8088, remote-buildable via `azd deploy`).

- Port 8088 is the standard Foundry agent port
- `--platform linux/amd64` only needed for local builds
- `azd deploy` builds remotely in Azure Container Registry by default — no local Docker needed. Use `azd ai agent run` when you intentionally want to build and run the agent locally.

---

## azure.yaml (unified hosted-agent configuration)

The old **two-file** contract (`agent.yaml` + `agent.manifest.yaml`) is
gone. A single `azure.yaml` at the project root is now the source of
truth for both the Foundry project/model deployment and the hosted
agent itself — declared as a graph of `services`, each with a `host`
field and a `uses` list of dependencies.

> **MUST:** Copy verbatim from [`references/yaml/azure.yaml`](references/yaml/azure.yaml). Do NOT redefine inline — the validator enforces single-source-of-truth. That file is the canonical `azure.ai.project` + `azure.ai.agent` service pair for a container-built hosted agent connecting to a **pre-provisioned** Foundry project.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-dev/main/schemas/v1.0/azure.yaml.json

requiredVersions:

    # fresh project + model deployment instead.
    endpoint: ${FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT}

        memory: 2Gi

infra:
  provider: microsoft.foundry
```

### Critical rules

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| `kind: hosted` on the `azure.ai.agent` service | Marks it as a containerized/source-built hosted agent (as opposed to a Foundry Agent Service prompt agent) |
| Protocol version `2.0.0` | Current GA protocol version. `"v1"` and `"1.0.0"` are historical preview values from before the two-file contract was retired — see [§ Migration from Initial Preview](#migration-from-initial-preview-pre-april-2026) |
| `container.resources` nested object | NOT a top-level `resources:` list |
| NO `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` in `environmentVariables` | Reserved — the platform injects it automatically, along with `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ARM_ID`, `FOUNDRY_AGENT_NAME`, `FOUNDRY_AGENT_VERSION`, `FOUNDRY_AGENT_SESSION_ID`, and `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`. Declaring any of them yourself is redundant at best and risks shadowing the platform value |
| `uses: [ai-project]` on the agent service | Forms the dependency graph `azd` resolves at provision/deploy time — the agent can't reference the project's model deployment without it |
| Connect to an existing project via `endpoint:` | Set `services.ai-project.endpoint` from `${FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT}` to reuse a pre-provisioned Foundry project instead of having `azd` provision a new one; omit `deployments:` you don't want `azd` to manage |
| `infra.provider: microsoft.foundry` | Selects the Foundry extension's bicep-less provisioning provider for the unified services graph; it does not rename or replace the `azure.ai.agents` extension |

> **One schema, no scaffold-time mustache.** Unlike the old two-file
> contract, there is no separate `{{VAR}}`-templated companion file.
> `${VAR_NAME}` in `azure.yaml` resolves client-side from your `azd`
> environment (`.azure/<env>/.env`) at `azd provision`/`deploy` time;
> `${{ connections.<name>.<path> }}` resolves server-side, at sandbox
> start, from a Foundry project connection (e.g. secrets) — see the
> [`azure.yaml` reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/agents/concepts/azure-yaml-reference)
> for the full field list, including `azure.ai.connection` and
> `azure.ai.toolbox` services this skill doesn't otherwise cover.

> **Foundry provider is bicep-less.** `infra.provider:
> microsoft.foundry` selects the Foundry extension's provisioning
> provider, which synthesizes infrastructure from the `services` graph
> at `azd provision` time; there is no local `infra/` directory. If you
> explicitly eject infrastructure with `azd ai agent init --infra` or
> `--infra=terraform`, the generated project switches the provider to
> `bicep` or `terraform` and uses those local files instead.

### Guided init vs. direct-copy brownfield deploy

The **recommended guided path** adopts the manifest and wires the existing
project/registry context into the active azd environment:

```bash
PROJECT_ID="/subscriptions/<sub-id>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<account>/projects/<project>"
azd ai agent init -m ./azure.yaml \
  --project-id "$PROJECT_ID" \
  --deploy-mode container
```

If you instead copy the canonical files into an existing repository and run
`azd deploy` directly, `azure.yaml` alone is insufficient. The
`azure.ai.agents` service target requires the full project ARM ID, project
endpoint, subscription, and bare ACR login server in the **active azd
environment**:

```bash
azd env set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID "<sub-id>"
azd env set FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT \
  "https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>"
azd env set AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ID \
  "/subscriptions/<sub-id>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<account>/projects/<project>"
azd env set AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT "<registry>.azurecr.io"
azd env set AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME "<model-deployment>"
azd deploy my-agent --no-prompt
```

`AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT` is a **bare hostname** — no
`https://` scheme and no trailing slash. This direct-copy limitation is
the adoption wiring covered by
[Azure/azure-dev #8981](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/8981):
`azd ai agent init ... --deploy-mode container` wires it automatically;
plain `azd deploy` cannot infer the omitted brownfield values.

### Installing the `azd` Foundry extensions

```bash
azd ext install microsoft.foundry
```

`microsoft.foundry` is a **beta meta-package** — it contributes no
commands of its own. Installing it pulls in every individual Foundry
extension: `azure.ai.agents` (`azd ai agent`, the one this skill uses),
`azure.ai.connections`, `azure.ai.inspector`, `azure.ai.projects`,
`azure.ai.routines`, `azure.ai.skills`, and `azure.ai.toolboxes`. It is
**not** a rename or replacement of `azure.ai.agents` — the agent
extension still owns the `azd ai agent` command group, the
`azure.ai.agent` service `host` value, and the `microsoft.foundry`
**provisioning** identifier azd uses internally when it synthesizes
infrastructure. Installing just `azure.ai.agents` also pulls in
`azure.ai.inspector` (a dependency), so it's a valid narrower
alternative to the meta-package:

```bash
# Just the agent surface (also pulls in azure.ai.inspector)
azd ext install azure.ai.agents

# Upgrade later
azd ext upgrade microsoft.foundry
```

Verify what's installed:

```bash
azd ext list --output json
```

## `azd env` variables for the `azure.ai.agents` extension

`azd ai agent init` is **bicep-less by default** — it doesn't write an
`infra/` directory; `azd` synthesizes infrastructure from the
`services` graph in `azure.yaml` at `azd provision` time. Guided init
writes the brownfield values below. A direct-copy deploy must set them
explicitly before `azd deploy`:

| Env var | Set via | Format | Why it matters |
|---------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | `azd env set` or guided init | subscription GUID | Selects the subscription containing the existing project and registry |
| `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | `azd env set` or guided init | `https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>` | Deploy-time project lookup for direct-copy brownfield deploy; also injected by Foundry into the running container, but MUST NOT be listed under `environmentVariables` |
| `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ID` | `azd env set` or guided init | `/subscriptions/<sub-id>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<account>/projects/<project>` | Full ARM ID required by `ensureFoundryProject`; an endpoint alone is insufficient |
| `AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT` | `azd env set` or guided init | `<registry>.azurecr.io` | Bare ACR login server used for container build/push; no scheme or trailing slash |
| `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` | `azd ai agent init` records it automatically from the deployment you select; change later with `azd env set` | deployment name (e.g. `gpt-5.4-mini`) | Projected through the agent service's `environmentVariables` entry in `azure.yaml`, and read by `container.py` / `main.py` as `os.environ["AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"]` |

`azd provision` writes these into `.azure/<env>/.env`. If you eject
Bicep (`azd ai agent init --infra`), the generated `main.bicep` exposes
the equivalent `output`s and you rarely need to hand-wire them.

> **Deploy-time azd env vs. runtime container env.**
> `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` MUST be set in the active azd environment for
> direct-copy brownfield deploy, but MUST NOT be projected through the
> agent's `environmentVariables` list. Foundry injects it into the running
> container. The same container-only prohibition applies to
> `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ARM_ID`, `FOUNDRY_AGENT_NAME`,
> `FOUNDRY_AGENT_VERSION`, `FOUNDRY_AGENT_SESSION_ID`, and
> `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`.

## Identity & RBAC

### Agent Identities

Each hosted agent gets a **dedicated Microsoft Entra agent identity**
(a service principal) at deploy time — this is what your running
container uses to call models and tools. `azd`, the VS Code Foundry
Toolkit, or the SDK/REST create it automatically; you don't configure
managed identities by hand. View it with `azd ai agent show`.

> **⚠️ ServiceIdentity Cosmos limitation.** The agent identity's
> principal type is not accepted by every data-plane RBAC engine —
> Cosmos DB in particular rejects direct role assignments against it
> with `unsupported type [Unfamiliar]`. The same has been seen against
> Azure AI Search data-plane in some configurations.
> **Workaround:** route Cosmos / Search access through an MCP server
> backed by a **separate User-Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI)**. Grant
> the data-plane role to that UAMI, give the agent only the MCP tool;
> the agent never touches the data plane directly.

> **Per-instance identity for Graph API.** When a hosted agent needs its own
> audit-distinct identity — calling Microsoft Graph (Calendar, Mail, Teams),
> performing on-behalf-of (OBO) flows, or operating cross-tenant — the
> standard project-scoped agent identity is not enough. The official
> `entra-agent-id` skill documents the `fmi_path` token-exchange pattern,
> app-registration setup, and the `ai.azure.com` token-scope requirement.

### Default case: no agent role assignment needed

Per the [Hosted agent permissions reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/agents/concepts/hosted-agent-permissions):
*"The agent identity can access model inferencing through the project
endpoint and session storage by default."* Implicit access covers:

- Model inferencing through the project endpoint (`FoundryChatClient(project_endpoint=..., credential=DefaultAzureCredential())` — the standard pattern in this skill)
- Session storage read and write

**No explicit role assignment or additional configuration is needed
for the standard case documented in [§ Runtime Pattern](#runtime-pattern-maf-variant).**
There is no postdeploy RBAC-grant hook to run, and no canonical
account-scope `Foundry User` grant for the agent identity in this
skill's default path — both were removed as part of the GA migration.
If you were relying on `references/bash/postdeploy-agent.sh` or a
manual `Foundry User` grant to the agent's `instance_identity` /
`blueprint.principal_id` from a pre-GA build of this skill, delete
that step; it's not just unnecessary now, it's dead weight.

**Deploying user** still needs a role to create/update the agent:

| Role | Scope | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| `Foundry Project Manager` | Foundry project | Data-plane permissions to create/update agents, plus the ability to create role assignments for the agent identity if an advanced scenario needs one |

`azd` and the VS Code Foundry Toolkit handle the ACR pull role
(**Container Registry Repository Reader** on the project's managed
identity) automatically as part of `azd deploy`.

### Agent access beyond defaults (advanced scenarios only)

Additional permissions are only needed when an agent uses connected
tools that access **external** resources, references data outside its
own project, or calls **account-level** capabilities directly (bypassing
the project endpoint). Grant the **least-privilege** role for the
specific capability actually called — don't reach for a broad role by
default:

| Scenario | Role | Scope | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| Agent calls the account-level OpenAI endpoint directly (bypassing the project endpoint) | `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` | Foundry account | Covers only OpenAI data actions — narrower than `Foundry User` |
| Agent calls account-level non-OpenAI capabilities directly (Speech, Content Safety, Vision, Document Intelligence, Language, Translator) | `Cognitive Services User` | Foundry account | Covers those capabilities without granting OpenAI/agents access |
| Agent needs both of the above with a single grant | `Foundry User` | Foundry account | Broadest of the three — use only if the agent genuinely needs both OpenAI and non-OpenAI account-level capabilities |
| Custom project-level access beyond the implicit default | Custom role scoped to `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/AIServices/responses/*` + `agents/*/read` + `agents/*/write` | Foundry project | Lower privilege than the built-in `Foundry User` role for the project-level inferencing case; requires `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` at the project scope to create |

> Because a role assignment against the agent identity can't be created
> until after the agent exists, the user/principal that creates the
> agent also needs permission to assign roles. `Foundry Project Manager`
> at the project scope is the recommended assignment for agent creators
> in this scenario — it includes both the data-plane permissions and
> the ability to assign the `Foundry User` role.

## Deployment Flow

```
azd up
  ├── provision → synthesize infra from azure.yaml services (Foundry
  │   project + model deployment, ACR, monitoring) — bicep-less by
  │   default; use ejected Bicep/Terraform if you materialized infra
  ├── postprovision hooks (if any)
  ├── azd ai agent extension →
  │   ├── Build container remotely via ACR (default)
  │   ├── Push image + create hosted agent version
  │   └── Agent gets a dedicated Entra identity with implicit access
  │       to model inferencing + session storage — no RBAC grant step
  └── deploy other services (bot, MCP servers, etc.)
```

### Invocation

```python
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

project = AIProjectClient(
    endpoint="<project_endpoint>",
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
)
oai = project.get_openai_client(agent_name="my-agent")
response = oai.responses.create(input="Hello!", stream=False)
print(response.output_text)
```

`allow_preview=True` is **not required** for this call (see the
Multi-Agent § note above for the SDK-level detail). Or via CLI:
`azd ai agent invoke "Hello!"`. Or via REST:

```
POST {project_endpoint}/agents/{name}/endpoint/protocols/openai/responses?api-version=v1
```

### Compute Lifecycle

- **Automatic** — no manual start/stop
- Provisions on first request
- Deprovisions after 15 minutes of inactivity
- No replica management

> **Container status API.** The `.../versions/{v}/containers/default`
> endpoint (and the `:start` action) is not a supported public status
> surface for hosted agents — the platform auto-provisions containers.
> If your deploy or eval script polls a container-status endpoint to
> check readiness, **skip straight to a warmup chat** instead. Pattern:
> attempt a `responses.create("ping")` warmup with retry/backoff. Poll
> the version's `status` field (`creating` → `active` / `failed`) via
> `project.agents.get_version(...)` or `azd ai agent show` if you need
> a structured readiness signal.

## Region Availability

Not all regions support hosted agents. If you get `"The requested experience is
not available for this subscription"`, try a different region.

> **Snapshot — 2026-07-14.** Per the authoritative
> [Region availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/agents/concepts/hosted-agents#region-availability)
> page, Hosted agents are currently available in **20 regions**: East US 2,
> North Central US, Sweden Central, Canada Central, Canada East,
> Southeast Asia, Poland Central, South Africa North, Korea Central,
> South India, Brazil South, West US, West US 3, Norway East, Japan
> East, France Central, Germany West Central, Switzerland North, Spain
> Central, Australia East. **This list is not evergreen** — Microsoft
> updates it as more regions come online. Re-check the live page before
> you commit a region; East US 2 in particular used to fail (a stale,
> now-outdated claim from an earlier preview build of this skill) and
> is on the current list.

Verify current model + hosted-agent availability together before you
commit a region:

```bash
# Hosted agents + model deployability in an existing account's region
az cognitiveservices account list-models --resource-group <rg> --name <account> -o table

# Model availability in a region (pre-account planning)
az cognitiveservices model list --location <region> -o table
```

> Region choice interacts with model + capacity availability and data residency — see [`references/model-selection.md`](references/model-selection.md) §§ 2–4.

## Gateway throttle finding (historical, pre-GA — unverified post-GA)

> **Status: historical.** The finding below was observed during the
> May 2026 preview era, before container hosted-agent deploy reached
> GA. It has **not** been re-verified against the current GA gateway.
> Treat it as a diagnostic pattern to recognize if you see the same
> symptoms — not as production sizing guidance for a GA deployment. If
> you reproduce it post-GA, that's worth a fresh, dated finding of its
> own; don't assume the ~6-call boundary still applies.

The Foundry hosted-agent gateway had an undocumented preview-time
throttle: **~6 sustained sequential invocations per warm period**
before sticky `internal_server_error` responses with a **5–10 minute
recovery window**. Validated in May 2026 against a real pilot agent
across 3 successive eval runs, pre-GA.

### Detection signature

Look for ALL of these together:

* Cold-start: first 1–2 warmup pings return `server_error` in 5–10s
  before the platform brings a replica up
* Warm phase: exactly **5–6 sequential invocations** answer in 30–60s
  each (real tool work) with normal latency
* Throttle phase: from invocation 7–9 onwards, every call returns
  `internal_server_error` (or `server_error` / `model:""`) in **5–10s
  consistent latency** — too fast for real tool work, too slow for a
  4xx routing failure
* Recovery: **5–10 min idle restores normal operation** (no manual
  restart, no replica scale, no env change required)

### What's NOT the cause

Each lever was independently bumped in a controlled test (single pilot
agent, 30-scenario eval) and the boundary did NOT move:

| Lever | Before | After | Effect on 6-call boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Container CPU | 0.25 | 1.0 | none |
| Container memory | 0.5Gi | 2Gi | none |
| Replicas | 1 (no scale) | min=1 max=3 | none |
| Model TPM | 50K | 300K | +1 answered scenario only |
| Pacing between invocations | 5s | 30s | none |
| Invocation retries | 1 | 3 | retry burst makes it WORSE |

The boundary is **gateway-side, not container-side**. Container restart,
replica swap, and `azd deploy agent` all leave the throttle window
unchanged.

### Mitigation (eval / workshop posture)

* **Run evals in 5-scenario batches** with 5-minute cooldown between
  batches. Pre-warm each batch with a throwaway invocation. See
  `foundry-evals` SKILL § "Warmup retry loop, not single-shot" and
  § "Resume-after-cooldown".
* **Move tool work to INGEST time** where feasible — visual extraction,
  document parsing, embedding generation should run in a one-shot
  ACA Job or postprovision script, not inside the agent's tool budget.
  See `foundry-doc-vision-speech` SKILL § Pattern X for the ingest-time
  vision pattern that explicitly sidesteps this throttle.
* **Sample, don't burst** for continuous-eval — see `foundry-evals`
  SKILL § Continuous Evaluation Loop, Plan A `EvaluationRule` with
  `event_type=SAMPLED` (not `RESPONSE_COMPLETED`).

### Production posture (not just demo)

* **Target architecture for production traffic at scale: APIM gateway
  in front of the hosted agent**, with retry + queue semantics in the
  gateway (not in every client). The hosted-agent runtime itself is the
  bottleneck; horizontally scaling the agent container does NOT bypass
  the throttle.
* **File a Foundry support ticket** with detection-signature evidence
  if the throttle blocks your production sizing — preview limits are
  often raised on request once a pattern is documented end-to-end.

### Diagnosis blocker

Confirming root cause is hard because the throttle window typically
coincides with **zero `AppExceptions` / `AppTraces` reaching App
Insights** — the gateway absorbs the failed requests and never emits
container-side telemetry for them. Ensure your `_init_telemetry()`
guard is in place (see § Troubleshooting → AppInsights row + `gap O-011`
in `foundry-observability`) BEFORE investigating; otherwise you're
flying blind.

## Version rollout patterns (blue-green / canary / rollback)

Foundry hosted agents are versioned and the platform supports **native
weighted traffic routing** between versions — no client-side router,
custom load balancer, or APIM rewrite required. Each `create_version`
call produces an immutable agent version; the agent endpoint's
`version_selector` distributes traffic across them via `FixedRatio`
rules (0-100 % per version, integers summing to 100). This unlocks
three production rollout patterns from a single primitive.

> **Requires:** Python SDK `azure-ai-projects~=2.3.0` (stable, no
> `allow_preview` needed for this surface), Azure CLI >= 2.80, and `azd`
> extension `azure.ai.agents`. Traffic routing is exposed through the
> **stable** `project.agents.update_details(...)` method — the old
> `project.beta.agents.patch_agent_details(...)` call and the
> `Foundry-Features: AgentEndpoints=V1Preview` header it required are
> gone; `azure-ai-projects` 2.3.0 does not expose
> `patch_agent_details` under `.beta.agents` at all (verified:
> `BetaAgentsOperations` only covers `AgentsOptimization` operations).

### When to use which pattern

| Pattern | Use when | Risk profile | Time-to-rollback |
|---------|----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Blue-green** | Image / model / role-binding change; want instant cutover with prior version warm in case of regression | Atomic; if v2 is broken, **every** request fails until rollback | < 30 s (one `update_details` call back to v1) |
| **Canary** | Same change classes; want gradual exposure with bounded blast radius | Bounded — typically 5-10 % see v2 first, ramp on success | < 30 s (one `update_details` call back to v1) at any ramp stage |
| **Rollback** | Production v2 misbehaving after promotion; emergency revert | Re-warm of v1 if cold; `creating` window only if v1 was already deleted | < 30 s (re-call) or 2-5 min (re-create v1 from prior image digest) |

The three patterns share **one primitive**: create v2 -> poll to
`active` -> update routing -> invoke -> (optional) delete prior.
Blue-green is "0 -> 100 % in one call"; canary is "10 -> 50 -> 100 %
across multiple calls"; rollback is "100 -> 0 % to the new version in
one call". Same SDK surface end to end.

### The 4-step rollout primitive

1. **Create v2** with `project.agents.create_version(agent_name=...,
   definition=HostedAgentDefinition(kind="hosted", cpu=..., memory=...,
   environment_variables={"AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME": _env("AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"), "_BUILD_TS": ...},
   container_configuration=ContainerConfiguration(image=...),
   protocol_versions=[ProtocolVersionRecord(protocol=AgentEndpointProtocol.RESPONSES, version="2.0.0")]))`.
   Returns immediately with `status: "creating"`. A new immutable version
   does not inherit omitted definition fields, so carry every required
   runtime variable forward; `_BUILD_TS` is additive, not a replacement.
2. **Poll** the version via `project.agents.get_version(agent_name,
   agent_version)` until `status == "active"` (typically 2-5 min;
   `failed` is terminal — read the `error` field for cause).
3. **Update routing** via `project.agents.update_details(agent_name=...,
   agent_endpoint=AgentEndpointConfig(version_selector=VersionSelector(...),
   protocol_configuration=ProtocolConfiguration(responses=ResponsesProtocolConfiguration())))`
   with `version_selection_rules` summing to 100.
4. **Invoke** the agent endpoint as usual (`responses.create(...)`) —
   the platform routes per the rules. (Optional) **delete the prior
   version** with `project.agents.delete_version(...)` ONLY after
   sustained success; keep it warm if you might need to roll back.

The canonical reference is
[`references/python/version_rollout.py`](references/python/version_rollout.py)
— a single script that demonstrates all three patterns end-to-end
against a real project, using the stable `azure-ai-projects` 2.3.0
surface. Import it from your tooling; do NOT redefine inline (per
AGENTS.md § 7 SSOT rule).

### Blue-green example (atomic 0 -> 100 % cutover)

```python
from azure.ai.projects.models import (
    AgentEndpointConfig,
    ProtocolConfiguration,
    ResponsesProtocolConfiguration,
    FixedRatioVersionSelectionRule,
    VersionSelector,
)

# After create_version + wait-for-active for v2:
project.agents.update_details(
    agent_name=AGENT_NAME,
    agent_endpoint=AgentEndpointConfig(
        version_selector=VersionSelector(
            version_selection_rules=[
                FixedRatioVersionSelectionRule(
                    agent_version="2", traffic_percentage=100
                ),
            ]
        ),
        protocol_configuration=ProtocolConfiguration(
            responses=ResponsesProtocolConfiguration()
        ),
    ),
)
```

The cutover is **atomic at the gateway** — the next request after the
call returns sees v2. Existing inflight requests on v1 finish on v1
(no mid-request swap).

### Canary example (10 % -> 50 % -> 100 % staged promotion)

```python
# Phase 1 - 90/10:
project.agents.update_details(
    agent_name=AGENT_NAME,
    agent_endpoint=AgentEndpointConfig(
        version_selector=VersionSelector(
            version_selection_rules=[
                FixedRatioVersionSelectionRule(agent_version="1", traffic_percentage=90),
                FixedRatioVersionSelectionRule(agent_version="2", traffic_percentage=10),
            ]
        ),
        protocol_configuration=ProtocolConfiguration(
            responses=ResponsesProtocolConfiguration()
        ),
    ),
)
# Observe gen_ai response.id mix in AppIn for hours-to-days.
# Promote phases: 50/50 then 0/100 via the same update_details shape.
```

Traffic split percentages can be **arbitrary integers summing to 100**
— not fixed buckets. Choose ramps (5/95 -> 25/75 -> 50/50 -> 100/0)
sized to your traffic volume and observation window. For low-QPS
agents, 50/50 may be the smallest split that produces statistically
meaningful v2 sample within a single business day.

### Rollback (immediate revert)

If v2 misbehaves after promotion, **route back to v1 at 100 %** —
provided v1 was NOT yet deleted:

```python
project.agents.update_details(
    agent_name=AGENT_NAME,
    agent_endpoint=AgentEndpointConfig(
        version_selector=VersionSelector(
            version_selection_rules=[
                FixedRatioVersionSelectionRule(
                    agent_version="1", traffic_percentage=100
                ),
            ]
        ),
        protocol_configuration=ProtocolConfiguration(
            responses=ResponsesProtocolConfiguration()
        ),
    ),
)
```

This is **< 30 s round-trip** to atomic revert. If you already deleted
v1, recovery requires re-creating it from the prior image digest (2-5
min cold provision + warmup) — which is why the **don't delete v1
until v2 is proven** discipline matters. **Keep prior version for
>= 24 h** after promotion to 100 % is the safe default.

### Preconditions and traps

The rollout patterns are sensitive to two existing traps documented
above — these are NOT new failure modes but they become much more
visible when you're moving versions around:

- **[`create_version` dedup trap](#create_version-deduplication-trap)**
  — if v2 has identical environment variables, image tag, **and**
  metadata to v1, the platform silently returns v1 (no error). Your
  "v2 deploy" is then your v1, and the canary appears stuck at 100 % v1
  even though the `update_details` call succeeded. **Always bump a
  `_BUILD_TS` or `_GIT_SHA` environment variable** on every
  `create_version` call to defeat the dedup, while also carrying required
  runtime variables such as `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` into the new
  complete definition. The canonical reference script does both.
- **[ACR layer-cache trap](#acr-layer-cache-trap-per-job-images-built-via-dockerbuildrequest)**
  — if you tag both versions `:latest` and ACR caches a stale layer, v2
  may pull v1's image bits. **Pin by digest (`@sha256:...`) for canary
  windows** so the gateway routes to byte-identical-on-disk versions.
  Tag by date for human-readable rollback handles
  (`my-agent:rollback-20260612`).

### Inspection

`azd ai agent show` returns both the active set of versions AND the
current agent-endpoint traffic split — use it as the one-command
sanity check after every routing update:

```bash
azd ai agent show
# Versions:
#   1   active    image: my-agent@sha256:abc...
#   2   active    image: my-agent@sha256:def...
# Endpoint protocols: responses (2.0.0)
# Traffic routing:
#   version 1: 90 %
#   version 2: 10 %
```

If the traffic split shown by `azd ai agent show` does not match what
you just set, you are likely hitting the dedup trap (v2 silently
became v1) — re-check `azd ai agent show` for whether v2 was actually
created, and inspect each version's `environment_variables` for a
unique build stamp.

### Production posture

- **The traffic-routing surface (`update_details` +
  `AgentEndpointConfig`) is stable, GA SDK surface** — no preview
  header needed. Still worth a non-prod dry run before your first
  production rollout of a given change class, same as any other
  production routing change.
- **Keep prior version for >= 24 h** after promotion to 100 %. That's
  enough for instant rollback without re-provisioning. Idle versions
  cost nothing — see [§ Compute Lifecycle](#compute-lifecycle) (auto-
  deprovision after 15 min idle; no replica charges in between
  requests).
- **Never canary across the agent version AND the backing chat-model
  deployment simultaneously.** If you're also bumping
  `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` in v2, the traffic split conflates
  two independent variables and the gen_ai telemetry becomes ambiguous.
  Split on agent version first; after promotion, do a separate model
  rollout.
- **Pair the canary phase with continuous evaluation** — see
  `foundry-evals` § Continuous Evaluation Loop. The eval runner's
  per-response sampling naturally surfaces v2 quality regressions
  within the canary window.
- **ACA-side rollout primitives (revisions, ingress weighting) do NOT
  apply here.** Foundry hosted agents run on platform-managed compute,
  not customer-managed ACA. The "split-traffic-between-revisions"
  pattern in `foundry-caphost-lifecycle` is a sibling primitive for a
  different runtime — it has no integration point with the Foundry
  agent-version surface. Do NOT try to wire ACA ingress weights to
  agent versions.

## Troubleshooting

### Diagnosing `server_error` locally

Foundry's `server_error` is a **generic envelope** that hides the actual
failure code. Don't read it as "the agent is broken" — it almost always means
a specific downstream layer failed (chat-model quota, telemetry init,
identity, MCP) and the runtime swallowed the real exception in the response
body. **Always pull `run.last_error` first** before chasing higher-level
theories — it carries the actual code and message in most cases.

**Step 1 — pull `run.last_error` with the SYNC client** (async
`AIProjectClient` silently fails to surface `last_error` on streamed
responses; use the SYNC client for this one-shot diagnostic):

```python
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

pc = AIProjectClient(endpoint="<your-project-endpoint>",
                     credential=DefaultAzureCredential())
client = pc.get_openai_client(agent_name="<agent-name>")
resp = client.responses.create(input="ping")
print(resp.model_dump_json(indent=2))  # inspect `last_error.code` + `.message`
```

Common `last_error.code` values seen behind `server_error`:

| `last_error.code` | Real cause | Where to look next |
|-------------------|------------|--------------------|
| `rate_limit_exceeded` | Backing chat-model deployment hit TPM/RPM quota | "Backing-model 429" row below; run `references/bash/diagnose_server_error.sh` |
| `model_error` / `invalid_request` | Bad request shape (tools schema, max tokens) | Reproduce against the model deployment directly with the helper's Step 3 |
| `internal_error` + empty message | Container crashed at startup, or `_init_telemetry()` raised | "telemetry init" rows below; pull `:logstream` |
| (no `last_error` at all) | Agent identity has no inference role on the deployment | "agent returns `server_error` … zero rows" row below |

**Step 2 — run the bash helper** for the most common root cause (backing-model
quota exhaustion). It consolidates deployment-quota inspection, a direct
chat-completions reproduction that bypasses the agent runtime, and an
optional App Insights KQL probe — see
[`references/bash/diagnose_server_error.sh`](references/bash/diagnose_server_error.sh):

```bash
AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP=<rg> FOUNDRY_ACCOUNT=<acct> \
MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<deployment> \
  ./references/bash/diagnose_server_error.sh
```

The helper prints `=== Verdict ===` ending in `CONFIRMED 429` / `LIKELY 429`
/ `NOT 429` / `inconclusive`. On `CONFIRMED 429`, raise the deployment's
`Capacity` (TPM in thousands) via portal or `az cognitiveservices account
deployment update --capacity <N>` — no agent redeploy needed.

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT is reserved` | Declared in `azure.yaml` `environmentVariables` | Remove it — platform injects automatically |
| `AGENT_* env var is reserved` | All `FOUNDRY_*` and `AGENT_*` prefixed vars are reserved | Use a different prefix (e.g. `TL_SUB_AGENTS`) |
| `session_not_ready` (424) | Container crashed before readiness probe | Check logstream: `curl ...sessions/{sid}:logstream`. Common causes: import error, sync/async mismatch, missing dep |
| Sub-agent tool calls return "Function failed" | `FoundryAgent` uses old `agent_reference` pattern | Use the client-swap pattern: `sub_client.client = project_client.get_openai_client(agent_name=...)` |
| Sub-agent calls silently fail (empty output) | `AIProjectClient` imported from sync (`azure.ai.projects`) | MUST use `azure.ai.projects.aio` — sync `get_openai_client` returns sync OpenAI which fails in async `FoundryChatClient` |
| `PermissionDenied: Principal does not have access` (standard project-scoped model inference) | Should not happen by default — the agent identity has implicit access. If it does, the project's own managed identity may be missing `Foundry User` on the Foundry account (an account/project provisioning issue, not an agent-identity issue) | See [§ Identity & RBAC](#identity--rbac). Do NOT reach for a broad `Foundry User` grant on the agent identity as a first fix — that's not how access is modeled anymore |
| `PermissionDenied` when the agent calls an **external** resource or the **account-level** endpoint directly | Advanced scenario beyond the implicit default | Grant the least-privilege role for the specific capability called — see [§ Agent access beyond defaults](#agent-access-beyond-defaults-advanced-scenarios-only) |
| **`401 Unauthorized` on every Responses call after `azd deploy`; RBAC visibly correct (`Foundry User` on both scopes)** | Orchestrator image still on `agent-framework-core` ≤ 1.3.x — requests the OLD `cognitiveservices.azure.com` token scope, which the post-rename Foundry data plane rejects. Most commonly happens to agent versions pinned by `sha256@…` digest (digest is frozen at the 1.3.x build) while a sibling agent on the same project that uses `:latest` works fine because ACR re-resolved it to a fresh 1.4.0 layer | Upgrade orchestrator `pyproject.toml` to `agent-framework-core~=1.4.0` + `agent-framework-foundry~=1.4.0` + `agent-framework-foundry-hosting==1.0.0a260514`, regenerate `uv.lock`, `az acr build` with BOTH `:latest` AND a date-pinned tag (`maf14-YYYYMMDDHHMM`), `azd deploy agents`, then re-import every agent version. See [§ MAF 1.4.0 breaking changes](#maf-140-breaking-changes-may-2026) for the full recipe |
| **`ImportError: cannot import name 'AzureOpenAIChatClient' from 'agent_framework.azure'`** after `pip install -U agent-framework-*` | `AzureOpenAIChatClient` was removed in `agent-framework-core` 1.4.0 (2026-05-14). Hits sidecars, agents service, eval judges — anywhere that talked directly to Azure OpenAI without going through `FoundryChatClient` | Swap to `from agent_framework.openai import OpenAIChatClient` and use `OpenAIChatClient(azure_endpoint=…, model=…, credential=DefaultAzureCredential())`. Drop the explicit `get_bearer_token_provider` / `ad_token_provider` — the SDK derives the right scope itself. See snippet in [§ MAF 1.4.0 breaking changes](#maf-140-breaking-changes-may-2026) |
| **`ImportError: cannot import name 'ChatAgent' from 'agent_framework'`** | `ChatAgent` was renamed to `Agent` in `agent-framework-core` 1.6.0. No alias is exported. Any prose / older SKILL examples showing `ChatAgent(chat_client=...)` are stale | **DO** `from agent_framework import Agent` and call `Agent(client=chat_client, tools=[...], instructions=...)`. Note: the kwarg also renamed from `chat_client=` to `client=` |
| **`AttributeError: module 'agent_framework' has no attribute 'tools'`** or `ImportError: cannot import name 'MCPStreamableHTTPTool' from 'agent_framework.tools.mcp'` | The `agent_framework.tools.mcp` submodule was promoted to top-level in 1.6.0. `MCPStreamableHTTPTool`, `MCPSseTool`, `MCPStdioTool` are now top-level exports of `agent_framework` | **DO** `from agent_framework import MCPStreamableHTTPTool`. No `[mcp]` extra is needed (and none exists in 1.6.0 — see § Dependencies) |
| **`uv` warning `unknown extra 'mcp' for agent-framework-core`** during install; pyproject ships looking MCP-ready but operators chase phantom issues | `[mcp]` extra does NOT exist in `agent-framework-core` 1.6.0. uv emits a warning but does NOT fail resolution, so the pyproject ships and the package is installed without the extra. MCP transport adapters are top-level exports already — no extra is needed | Remove `[mcp]` from the dep line: `agent-framework-core~=1.6.0` (NOT `agent-framework-core[mcp]~=1.6.0`). See § Dependencies callout at top |
| **Workload UAMI (companion service, e.g. a bot or MCP server, using its own identity) hits `Foundry User`-gated 403 even with `Foundry Account Owner`** | `Foundry Account Owner` covers control-plane operations only; account-level data-plane access (model inference, agents endpoint) requires an explicit grant. This is about a companion service's own identity, not the hosted agent's — the agent identity itself has implicit access by default (see § Identity & RBAC above) | Grant `Foundry User` (or the narrower `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` / `Cognitive Services User`) to the companion service's identity on the Foundry account scope. See [§ Agent access beyond defaults](#agent-access-beyond-defaults-advanced-scenarios-only) for the least-privilege options |
| `Experience not available for this subscription` | Region doesn't support hosted agents | Try a region from the current [§ Region Availability](#region-availability) list |
| Eval items have empty responses | Concurrent eval requests overwhelm cold-start container | Use sequential eval with warm-up request first (see `run_evals()` in evals.py) |
| Agent skips evidence-gathering tools and emits hollow packets | gpt-5.4-mini tool-call discipline degrades on long instruction chains (10+ steps); model calls commit-tool before evidence is ready | Two complementary fixes: (1) switch `MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` to `gpt-5.4` (full); (2) make commit-tools refuse hollow inputs server-side via the validate-or-reject pattern in `foundry-mcp-aca`. Recent strict-smoke runs showed low reproducibility with mini + permissive MCP and high reproducibility with gpt-5.4 + validate-or-reject. |
| `Managed environment provisioning timed out` | CapabilityHost was manually created/deleted | Do NOT create CapabilityHosts — platform manages infrastructure automatically |
| `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING is reserved` (HTTP 400 `invalid_request_error` at `create_version`) | Set in `azure.yaml` `environmentVariables` OR `HostedAgentDefinition.environment_variables` (e.g. as escape-hatch when platform auto-injection silently failed) | Remove it. Cannot be escape-hatched. You MUST guard `configure_azure_monitor()` defensively in `container.py` instead — use `_init_telemetry()` from `foundry-observability` (gap O-011). Observed in hosted-agent validation |
| Agent traces not appearing in AppInsights | Agent identities lack `Monitoring Metrics Publisher` (GUID `3913510d-...`) OR AppInsights connection missing on account. **IMPORTANT:** GUID `f526a384-...` is "Azure Event Hubs Data Owner" — a completely wrong role despite being mislabeled in some references. When `DisableLocalAuth: false`, RBAC is not required — ikey auth works | Assign `Monitoring Metrics Publisher` RBAC to both identity principal IDs. Create `AppInsights` connection on the **account** (not project): category `AppInsights`, target = ARM resource ID, metadata `ApiType: Azure`. |
| **Hosted agent returns `server_error`/`model:""` on every smoke; AppIn 0 rows; `azd ai agent show` reports active** | `container.py` calls raw `configure_azure_monitor()` as the first line of `main()` with no try/except. When the platform fails to auto-inject `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` (e.g. AppIn account-level connection persisted with `credentials: null`), the SDK raises `ValueError`. Container crashes before `ResponsesHostServer` binds. Foundry runtime sees no agent. **The agent itself is fine — telemetry init is what killed it.** | Wrap telemetry init in `_init_telemetry()` (no-ops on missing env / SDK ImportError / any SDK exception). Never call `configure_azure_monitor()` raw at module/main scope. See `foundry-observability` gap row O-011 |
| **AppInsights connection PUT 400 ValidationError "AuthType for AppInsights Connection can only be ApiKey"** | Account-RP scope `2025-10-01-preview` in some regions rejects `authType: AAD` despite skill guidance (correlation IDs available) | Use `authType: ApiKey` with `credentials.key` in body. **BUT:** the key is silently dropped server-side — GET returns `credentials: null` and platform never injects the env var. There is no working workaround at the platform layer. File a support ticket; ship with guarded `_init_telemetry()` so the agent functions without telemetry; consider region pivot |
| **AppInsights connection account-level "1-per-category" limit** | Account-level `AppInsights` connections enforce a single-instance-per-category constraint — cannot create parallel connections in the same account. Re-creation requires DELETE first | DELETE the existing connection BEFORE re-PUT. Use `az rest --method DELETE` with full URI **as a variable** (do NOT inline `?api-version=...` — see next row) |
| **`az rest --method DELETE` strips `?api-version=...` query string when URI is inlined on PowerShell** | PowerShell argument parsing eats the `?api-version=` before `az` sees it. The DELETE then fails with "MissingApiVersionParameter" or behaves inconsistently against the bare resource without the version | Workaround: assign the URI to a variable first, then pass via `--uri $delUri`: `$delUri = "https://management.azure.com/.../connections/<name>?api-version=2025-10-01-preview"; az rest --method DELETE --uri $delUri` |
| ACA job uses old code after deploy | Postdeploy hook fails (`AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT not set`) | Run `cd infra/scripts && uv run deploy_job.py` manually after each `azd deploy` |
| **`mcp-config.json` `${ENV_VAR}/mcp` expands to `/mcp` when env var unset** | Regex expansion `${MCP_SERVER_URL}` → `""` produces URL `"/mcp"` — truthy but not a valid HTTP URL. `get_mcp_tool(url="/mcp")` either crashes or sends requests to localhost. | **In `_create_mcp_tools()`, guard with `if not url or not url.startswith("http")` instead of just `if not url`. Agent gracefully skips and runs instruction-only when no MCP server is deployed.** |
| Container starts but `agent_reference` errors in logs | `FoundryAgent` used for sub-agents | Replace with client-swap pattern |
| Protocol version error | Using `"v1"` or the historical `"1.0.0"` | Use the current GA semver `"2.0.0"` |
| **Sticky `424 session_not_ready` for 8+ minutes; ZERO AppIn / LAW signal** | New Python module added to agent code but NOT included in Dockerfile `COPY` line. Module import fails on container start → `ResponsesHostServer` never binds → `/readiness` never returns 200 → Foundry retries readiness in long backoff → every Responses request returns sticky `424`. App Insights shows nothing because `_init_telemetry()` never runs (the module that calls it didn't even import). Near-impossible to diagnose from logs because there are no logs | Explicitly enumerate every Python module in the Dockerfile `COPY` line; do NOT rely on `COPY ./* .` or `COPY . .` globs (silently skip dotfiles + reorder hazards + cache-bust footguns). Pattern: `COPY container.py corpus.py my_kb_tool.py copilot-instructions.md ./`. After ANY new `.py` added to the agent module, re-check Dockerfile + rebuild |
| **Sticky `424 session_not_ready` after MAF 1.4.0 upgrade; logstream shows `TypeError: SkillsProvider.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'skill_paths'`** | `SkillsProvider(skill_paths=...)` keyword constructor was **removed** in `agent-framework-core` 1.4.0. Container crashes at agent init before `ResponsesHostServer` binds. All agents using `skill_paths=` fail; agents without skills (or using `from_paths()`) work fine on the same base image | Replace `SkillsProvider(skill_paths=skills_dir)` with `SkillsProvider.from_paths(skills_dir)`. Rebuild base image + all per-job overlay images. Verify via logstream: look for `SkillsProvider configured` log line instead of `TypeError` |
| **Skill silently missing from agent — `load_skill` never offered for one skill; container starts fine, other skills work** | `SkillsProvider` (MAF 1.6.0) validates each `SKILL.md` YAML frontmatter `description:` field against a **1024-character limit**. If a skill's description exceeds 1024 chars, MAF logs `ERROR agent_framework._skills Skill '<name>' has an invalid description: Must be 1024 characters or fewer` and **silently drops the skill** from the advertised set. No crash, no `session_not_ready` — the agent runs with N-1 skills. Extremely hard to diagnose without container logs because the agent appears healthy | Trim the YAML `description:` field to ≤ 1024 chars. Condense `USE FOR` / `DO NOT USE FOR` phrases; move verbose guidance into the skill body below the frontmatter. Verify with: `python3 -c "import yaml; d=yaml.safe_load(open('SKILL.md').read().split('---')[1]); print(len(d.get('description','')))"` — must print ≤ 1024. Discovered May 2026 — a skill with 1054-char description was silently dropped, only 3/4 skills loaded |
| **`azure.yaml` `container.resources` block silently not applied by an older `azd ai agent deploy`** | Historical (pre-GA) reports of the deploy CLI accepting the block at the YAML schema layer but not passing it through to the platform — deployed agents came up at default `cpu`/`memory` regardless of what the YAML declared. Re-verify against your current `azd` extension version before assuming this still applies post-GA | Confirm actual deployed resources with `azd ai agent show --output json` (`definition.cpu` / `definition.memory`). If they don't match `azure.yaml`, retry after upgrading the `azure.ai.agents` extension; file a CLI bug if reproducible on a current extension version |
| **Scary RED `404 NotFound` block at the tail of `azd deploy <any-service>` (`agents/<key>/versions/<n>` not found); the actual deploy succeeded** | The `azure.ai.agents` azd extension's postdeploy hook fires after **every** `azd deploy` invocation (including unrelated services like `bot`, `workspace`, `mcp`) and looks up `agents/<service-key>/versions/<n>` — using the SERVICE KEY from `azure.yaml` verbatim, not the actual agent name. If your azure.yaml has e.g. `services.agent.host: azure.ai.agent` but the real agent is named `orchestrator`, the postdeploy hook 404s on `agents/agent/versions/<n>` every single time. Benign-but-loud false alarm; pollutes CI logs and CX in pilots | **Preferred**: rename the service key in `azure.yaml` to match the agent name (`services.orchestrator.host: azure.ai.agent`). **If you can't rename** (downstream scripts reference the key): error is cosmetic — verify with `azd ai agent show <agent-name>`. Track as `azure.ai.agents` extension bug; consider proposing an extension-level config like `agentName:` override |
| **Agent returns `server_error`; `run.last_error.code` is `rate_limit_exceeded`** | The **backing chat-model deployment** (the one named in `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`) hit its TPM/RPM quota. The agent runtime catches the 429 and re-emits the generic `server_error` in the chat envelope, so the throttle is invisible from the agent's response body. Hits demos and bursty eval loops most often. This is the deployment's own quota — NOT the historical gateway-level throttle described in [§ Gateway throttle finding](#gateway-throttle-finding-historical-pre-ga--unverified-post-ga), which is a different layer. | Run `references/bash/diagnose_server_error.sh` (lists deployment `Capacity`, reproduces a direct chat call to confirm the 429 is at the model layer, optionally KQLs App Insights for `429`). On `CONFIRMED 429`, raise `Capacity` (TPM, in thousands) via `az cognitiveservices account deployment update --deployment-name <name> --capacity <N>` or the portal. No agent redeploy needed. See `### Diagnosing server_error locally` above for the SYNC `last_error` probe. |
| **Agent returns `server_error` on every call; a manual advanced-access role assignment appears not to have taken effect; `az role assignment list --assignee <principal_id> --all` returns ZERO rows** | Deploy script calls ARM `PUT roleAssignments/` for the agent identity (an advanced-scenario grant per [§ Agent access beyond defaults](#agent-access-beyond-defaults-advanced-scenarios-only)), but the deployer's own identity only has `Contributor` — which **excludes** `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write`. The ARM PUT returns 403, deploy script logs a warning and continues | Grant `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` (e.g. via `Role Based Access Control Administrator` or `User Access Administrator`) to the deployer's identity, scoped to the Foundry project (not the whole subscription) — least-privilege scope. Verify: `az role assignment list --assignee <deployer_identity> --scope <project_id> --query "[].roleDefinitionName"` |
| **Deploy script polls `.../versions/{v}/containers/default` and gets 404 for minutes; agent is actually working** | Refreshed-preview hosted agents auto-provision containers — the legacy `/containers/default` status endpoint and `:start` action are not exposed. Polling this endpoint wastes 3+ min and blocks downstream steps (RBAC assignment, eval warmup) | Skip the container status/start API entirely. Go straight to a warmup chat (`responses.create("ping")`) with retry/backoff. If the warmup succeeds, the agent is ready — no container API needed. See § Compute Lifecycle note on refreshed preview |

### Cross-skill ownership

> This SKILL describes runtime patterns for hosted agents on Foundry (container build, SDK wiring, debugging). Some concerns belong to sibling SKILLs:

### Container Logs (Logstream API)

```bash
# Get session ID from session_not_ready error, then:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  "$PROJECT_ENDPOINT/agents/orchestrator/versions/$VER/sessions/$SID:logstream?api-version=2025-11-15-preview"
```

Returns SSE events with `{"stream":"stderr","message":"..."}` — shows startup logs, tracebacks.
Also: `azd ai agent monitor` (session auto-resolves from the last invoke; `--session-id` optional)

### Useful Commands

```bash
azd ai agent show                    # Agent status, identities, version, endpoints (--output json|table)
azd ai agent monitor                 # Stream logs; session auto-resolves from last invoke (--follow to tail, --session-id optional)
azd ai agent invoke "Hello!"         # Quick test; consecutive invokes REUSE the session (--new-session to reset)
azd ai agent sessions                # Manage sessions (list / show / stop / delete)
azd deploy <service> --no-prompt     # Redeploy a service without reprovisioning
```

> **CLI shape gotchas (verified live against `azure.ai.agents@1.0.0-beta.4`, July 2026):**
>
> - **Multiple hosted-agent services: pass the service name positionally.**
>   `azd ai agent show / invoke / monitor [name]` — name and version
>   auto-resolve from `azure.yaml` + the current azd environment when there's
>   a single service. With more than one `host: azure.ai.agent` entry, give
>   the service name (from `azure.yaml`) as the first positional argument, or
>   scope with the global `-C/--cwd`. (`azd ai agent sessions` uses
>   `--agent-name` instead of a positional for the same purpose.)
> - **`azd ai agent monitor` does NOT require `--session-id`.** The session
>   auto-resolves from the last invocation; `--session-id` is optional (use it
>   to target a specific session). Add `--follow/-f` to tail in real-time,
>   `--type system` for system events, `--tail N` (1-300) for recent lines.
> - **`azd ai agent invoke` reuses the session by default.** Sessions are
>   persisted per-agent — consecutive invokes reuse the same session
>   automatically; pass `--new-session` to force a reset. One positional arg
>   is the message (name auto-detected from `azure.yaml`); two args are
>   `[name] [message]`. `--input-file/-f` sends a file as the request body,
>   `--local` targets a locally-running agent (`azd ai agent run`), and
>   `--output raw` dumps the verbatim server response (status line + headers +
>   body) for debugging.
> - **Run agent commands from the azd project root** (where `azure.yaml` is),
>   or scope with the global `-C/--cwd`; otherwise the extension can't resolve
>   the project and errors out.

#### `azd ai agent show` output shape

The JSON shape a deploy script (e.g. one that persists the agent id
into `azd env` for downstream services) needs to parse:

```json
{
  "object": "agent.version",
  "id": "<service-name>:<version>",
  "name": "<service-name>",
  "version": "1",
  "agent_guid": "<guid>",
  "agent_endpoints": {
    "responses": "https://<acct>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<proj>/agents/<service-name>/endpoint/protocols/openai/responses?api-version=v1"
  },
  "definition": {
    "container_protocol_versions": [ { "protocol": "responses", "version": "2.0.0" } ],
    "cpu": "1", "memory": "2Gi",
    "image": "<acr>.azurecr.io/<service>/<service>-<env>:azd-deploy-<unix-ts>",
    "kind": "hosted",
    "environment_variables": { … }
  },
  "playground_url": "https://ai.azure.com/nextgen/r/…/build/agents/<service-name>/build?version=1",
  "status": "active" | "creating" | "failed"
}
```

Typical deploy-hook snippet (persist agent id for downstream services to read):

```bash
# Use .name (not .id) — .id returns "<service-name>:<version>", but downstream
# services need the bare agent name to construct /agents/<name>/endpoint/... URLs.
AGENT_NAME=$(azd ai agent show -o json | jq -r '.name')
azd env set WEATHER_AGENT_ID "$AGENT_NAME"
```

> No role grant is needed for the agent to reach the project's own
> model deployment (see [§ Identity & RBAC](#identity--rbac)). Only add
> an explicit role assignment against the agent's identity if it needs
> [access beyond the implicit default](#agent-access-beyond-defaults-advanced-scenarios-only)
> — e.g. calling the account-level OpenAI endpoint directly instead of
> through the project endpoint.

## Migration from Initial Preview (pre-April 2026)

| Initial Preview | Refreshed Preview |
|----------------|-------------------|
| `from_agent_framework(agent).run()` | `ResponsesHostServer(agent).run()` |
| `ChatAgent` | `Agent` (from `agent_framework`) |
| `AzureOpenAIChatClient` | `FoundryChatClient` (from `agent_framework.foundry`) |
| `AzureAIClient(agent_name=...)` | Client-swap: `FoundryChatClient.client = project_client.get_openai_client(agent_name=...)` |
| `@ai_function` | `@tool(approval_mode="never_require")` |
| `azure-ai-agentserver-agentframework` | `agent-framework-foundry-hosting` |
| Protocol version `"v1"` | `"1.0.0"` (semver) |
| `extra_body={"agent_reference": ...}` | `get_openai_client(agent_name=...)` |
| Shared project MI | Dedicated agent Entra identity |
| Manual `start`/`stop` | Automatic compute lifecycle |
| `ENABLE_CAPABILITY_HOST=true` | `ENABLE_CAPABILITY_HOST=false` — NO CapabilityHost creation |
| `project_client.agents.list()` at startup | `TL_SUB_AGENTS` env var (avoids blocking readiness) |
| `azure.ai.projects` (sync) in container | `azure.ai.projects.aio` (ASYNC) — sync silently fails |

> **⚠️ Historical (MAF 1.1.1):** `FoundryAgent` in MAF 1.1.1 silently
> hardcoded `extra_body={"agent_reference": ...}` internally — the old
> initial-preview pattern that fails against the refreshed preview.
> **As of MAF 1.8.0**, `FoundryAgent` has been rehabilitated: `__init__`
> takes `project_endpoint` + `agent_name` + `agent_version` properly,
> supports both PromptAgents and HostedAgents, and `extra_body` is only
> available as a user opt-in via `default_options`. The 1.1.1-era
> prohibition no longer applies; use `FoundryAgent` freely under
> MAF ≥ 1.8.0. The client-swap pattern above remains the recommended
> path for sub-agent delegation in this skill's container runtime;
> `FoundryAgent` is most useful for caller-side orchestration code (see
> [§ FoundryAgent timeout parameter (MAF 1.8.0)](#foundryagent-timeout-parameter-maf-180)).
> Exact version of rehabilitation between 1.1.1 and 1.8.0 not determined.

**Deadline:** Initial preview backend retires **May 22, 2026**.

### GA migration reference (two-file era → unified `azure.yaml`)

A separate, more recent migration than the table above: moving from
the **refreshed-preview two-file contract** to the **current GA**
unified-`azure.yaml` contract this skill now documents throughout.

| Refreshed preview (two-file era) | Current GA |
|---|---|
| `agent.yaml` (literal ContainerAgent schema) + `agent.manifest.yaml` (mustache scaffold) | Single `azure.yaml` — `azure.ai.project` + `azure.ai.agent` services |
| Protocol version `"1.0.0"` | Protocol version `"2.0.0"` |
| `project.beta.agents.patch_agent_details(agent_endpoint=AgentEndpoint(...))` for traffic routing | `project.agents.update_details(agent_endpoint=AgentEndpointConfig(...))` — stable, no preview header |
| `Foundry-Features: AgentEndpoints=V1Preview` REST header for routing calls | Not required — the routing surface is stable GA |
| `allow_preview=True` required for `get_openai_client(agent_name=...)` | Not required — verified against `azure-ai-projects` 2.3.0 |
| Postdeploy hook auto-assigns `Foundry User` to the agent identity | No role assignment needed by default — implicit access to model inferencing + session storage |
| `northcentralus`/`eastus`/`swedencentral`/`westus` known-working region list (April 2026) | 20-region list including East US 2 — see [§ Region Availability](#region-availability) |

If you're migrating an older project that still has `agent.yaml` +
`agent.manifest.yaml` and a `postdeploy-agent.sh`-style RBAC script,
delete both files and the script, move their content into the unified
`azure.yaml` service block, and remove the manual RBAC grant unless you
have a genuine [advanced-access](#agent-access-beyond-defaults-advanced-scenarios-only) requirement.

## Preview appendix: source-code deploy (still preview)

> **Status.** Everything in this appendix is **preview** — isolated
> here on purpose so it never bleeds into the GA container-deploy
> guidance above. *"Functionality, region availability, and APIs might
> change before general availability."* Source: [Deploy a hosted agent
> from source code (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/deploy-hosted-agent-code).
> Prefer the **container** (GA) path documented in the rest of this
> skill for production. Use this appendix only when you deliberately
> want a Docker-less inner loop.

Source-code deploy uploads a `.zip` of your Python or .NET code; the
platform builds it remotely instead of you building/pushing a
container image.

### `--deploy-mode code`

```bash
azd ai agent init --deploy-mode code --runtime python_3_13 \
  --entry-point main.py --dep-resolution remote_build
```

After initialization, `azd` writes the source-code settings to a
`codeConfiguration` block on the `azure.ai.agent` service in
`azure.yaml`:

```yaml
my-agent:
  host: azure.ai.agent
  kind: hosted
  codeConfiguration:
    runtime: python_3_13
    entryPoint: main.py
```

### Supported runtimes

The `codeConfiguration.runtime` field accepts **only** these values —
pick the one matching the binaries in your zip (Linux x86_64 wheels
for Python, or the `TargetFramework` of your `dotnet publish` output
for .NET):

| Language | Supported `runtime` values |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Python | `python_3_13`, `python_3_14` |
| .NET | `dotnet_10` |

**Python 3.11 and 3.12 are NOT supported for the source-code path.**
If your code targets 3.11/3.12, bump to 3.13+ before adopting
`--deploy-mode code`. This constraint is specific to the
platform-managed source-code runtime — container-mode deploys with a
custom Dockerfile can keep whatever Python the base image ships.

### Dependency resolution: `--dep-resolution`

| Value | Behavior | When to use |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `remote_build` (default) | Platform resolves + installs from your `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` server-side. | Faster iteration; smaller repo. |
| `bundled` | You vendor wheels locally (`pip download --target packages/ --platform manylinux2014_x86_64 --only-binary=:all:`) and the platform installs from the bundle. | Air-gapped policies; reproducible builds; deps not on PyPI. |

The resolver auto-detects `pyproject.toml` first, then falls back to
`requirements.txt`. Mixing both is unsupported.

### Preview REST header

Source-code deploy uses the preview `project.beta.agents` surface for
mutating calls. On raw REST (Create/Update/Delete), send:

```
Foundry-Features: CodeAgents=V1Preview,HostedAgents=V1Preview
```

`azd ai agent` adds this for you; raw REST / custom tooling must set it
explicitly. GET requests work without it today, but include it to be
safe — the header gates preview behaviour and may be enforced more
strictly before GA. On the Python SDK side, create the client with
`allow_preview=True` — this preview surface (unlike the GA
`get_openai_client(agent_name=...)` invoke path documented in the rest
of this skill) genuinely requires it, and `create_version_from_code` /
`download_code` live on `project.beta.agents`, not the stable
`project.agents`.

### Retirement policy

Foundry aligns hosted-agent language support with each language's
community end-of-life date. After a language's end-of-life date, you
can still create/update/run agents on the retired runtime value, but
they're not eligible for support, new features, or security patches
until you set a current `codeConfiguration.runtime` value and redeploy.

### Why this stays out of the GA guidance above

Mixing preview source-code-deploy guidance into the GA container-deploy
sections would make it easy to accidentally follow a preview code path
(with its own preview header, preview SDK surface, and narrower
runtime support) while believing you're on the stable GA path. Keep
them separate; if you need this path, treat every claim here as
preview and re-verify against the source doc before shipping.
