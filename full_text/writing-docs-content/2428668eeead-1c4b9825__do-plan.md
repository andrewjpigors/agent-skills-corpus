# Create a Plan — Context-Lean Edition

**Note: Use the current year** when dating plans and searching for recent documentation.

Transform feature descriptions into well-structured plan files. Research agents persist outputs to disk to avoid context exhaustion.

**All research outputs are retained for traceability and learning.** Research is namespaced by plan stem. Prior research is NEVER deleted.

## Feature Description

<feature_description> #$ARGUMENTS </feature_description>

**If the feature description above is empty**, use **AskUserQuestion**: "What would you like to plan? Please describe the feature, bug fix, or improvement you have in mind."

Do not proceed until you have a clear feature description from the user.

### 0a. Existing Plan Check

Before brainstorm lookup or idea refinement, check if a plan already exists for this feature:

```bash
ls -la docs/plans/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

Scan filenames and (if ambiguous) YAML frontmatter titles for semantic overlap with the feature description. Ignore files in `docs/plans/archive/`.

**If a matching plan exists:**

Use **AskUserQuestion**:

"Found an existing plan that matches this feature: `[filename]` ([status from frontmatter, e.g. 'active', 'completed']). What would you like to do?"

1. **Archive and re-plan** — Move the existing plan to `docs/plans/archive/` and create a fresh plan
2. **Run `/do:deepen-plan` instead** — Enhance the existing plan with parallel research agents
3. **Continue anyway** — Create a new plan alongside the existing one (e.g., different approach)

- If **Archive and re-plan**: Archive the plan and clear stale research artifacts:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p docs/plans/archive && mv <existing-plan> docs/plans/archive/
  # Clear stale research — tied to the archived plan, would confuse new research
  rm -rf $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/
  ```
  Announce: "Archived [filename] and cleared stale research. Proceeding with fresh plan." Continue to Step 0.
- If **Deepen-plan**: Stop planning. Tell the user: "Run `/do:deepen-plan` to enhance the existing plan." Do not proceed further.
- If **Continue anyway**: Proceed to Step 0 as normal. The new plan will have today's date, avoiding filename collision.

**If no matching plan exists:** Proceed to Step 0.

### 0. Idea Refinement

**Check for brainstorm output first:**

```bash
ls -la docs/brainstorms/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

**Relevance criteria:** A brainstorm is relevant if the topic (from filename or YAML frontmatter) semantically matches the feature description and was created within the last 14 days.

**If multiple brainstorms could match:**
Use **AskUserQuestion** to ask which brainstorm to use, or whether to proceed without one.

**If a relevant brainstorm exists:**
1. Read the brainstorm document **thoroughly** — every section matters
2. Announce: "Found brainstorm from [date]: [topic]. Using as foundation for planning."
3. Extract and carry forward **ALL** of the following into the plan:
   - Key decisions and their rationale
   - Chosen approach and why alternatives were rejected
   - Constraints and requirements discovered during brainstorming
   - Open/deferred questions (flag these for resolution during planning)
   - Success criteria and scope boundaries
   - Any specific technical choices or patterns discussed
4. **Skip the idea refinement questions below** — the brainstorm already answered WHAT to build
5. Use brainstorm content as the **primary input** to research and planning phases
6. **The brainstorm is the origin document.** Throughout the plan, reference specific decisions with `(see brainstorm: docs/brainstorms/<filename>)`. Do not paraphrase decisions in a way that loses their original context — link back to the source.

**If no brainstorm found, run idea refinement:**

Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to ask questions one at a time:
- Purpose, constraints, success criteria
- **Record the user's reasoning, not just their answer.** When the user explains *why* they want something or *why* they chose one approach over another, capture that rationale in the plan. The "why" prevents future sessions from relitigating settled decisions.
- Continue until clear OR user says "proceed"

**Gather research signals:** Note user familiarity, topic risk, uncertainty level.

## Main Tasks

### Stats Setup

Before any dispatches, initialize stats capture infrastructure:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/init-values.sh plan <plan-stem>
```

Read the output. Track the values PLUGIN_ROOT, MAIN_ROOT, WORKFLOWS_ROOT, RUN_ID, DATE, STATS_FILE, CACHED_MODEL (and NOTE if emitted) for use in subsequent steps. If init-values.sh fails or any value is empty, warn the user and stop.

**All `.workflows/` paths in this skill use `$WORKFLOWS_ROOT` (the main repo root's `.workflows/` directory), NOT relative `.workflows/`.** This ensures artifacts survive worktree lifecycle transitions and are shared across sessions.

Read `stats_capture` from `compound-workflows.local.md`. If `stats_capture` is `false`, skip all stats capture for this run. If missing or any other value, proceed with capture.

Use the CACHED_MODEL value from init-values.sh output as the default model for inherit-model agents. Use the STATS_FILE value from init-values.sh output. Initialize a dispatch counter at 0.

### Stats Capture

If stats_capture ≠ false in compound-workflows.local.md: after each Task/Agent completion, extract `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, and `duration_ms` values from the `<usage>` notification and format as a named-field string `"total_tokens: N, tool_uses: N, duration_ms: N"`. Pass this as the 9th argument to capture-stats.sh. If `<usage>` is absent, pass `"null"` as the 9th argument. Run: `bash $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/capture-stats.sh "$STATS_FILE" plan <agent> <step> <model> <stem> null $RUN_ID "<usage-string-or-null>"`. See `$PLUGIN_ROOT/resources/stats-capture-schema.md` for field derivation rules. Increment the dispatch counter for each capture call.

**Model resolution per dispatch:** Use `sonnet` for agents with `model: sonnet` in their YAML frontmatter or an explicit `model: sonnet` dispatch parameter. Use `CACHED_MODEL` for `inherit`-model agents. For red-team-relay dispatches with `model: sonnet`, record `sonnet`.

**Step field:** Use the agent role name as the step value. For verify-only re-dispatches (Phase 6.7), use `"<agent>-verify"` suffixes. For re-check dispatches (Phase 6.9), use `"<agent>-recheck"` suffixes. For red team MINOR triage, use `"red-team-minor-triage"`.

After all dispatches complete, validate entry count matches completed dispatch count:

```bash
bash $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/validate-stats.sh "$STATS_FILE" <DISPATCH_COUNT>
```

If validate-stats.sh reports a mismatch, warn with the names of missing agents. Do not fail the command.

### 1. Local Research (Parallel, Disk-Persisted)

Derive a plan stem from the feature description (e.g., `api-rate-limiting` or `user-dashboard-reporting`).

Create a working directory namespaced to this plan:

```bash
mkdir -p $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/agents
```

Launch research agents with **disk-write pattern**:

```
Task repo-research-analyst (run_in_background: true): "
You are a repository research analyst specializing in codebase pattern discovery.

Research existing patterns related to: <feature_description>
Focus on: similar features, established patterns, CLAUDE.md guidance.
Read the codebase, not just file names.

=== OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS (MANDATORY) ===
Write your COMPLETE findings to: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/agents/repo-research.md
After writing the file, return ONLY a 2-3 sentence summary.
"

Task learnings-researcher (run_in_background: true): "
You are an institutional knowledge researcher. Search docs/solutions/ for relevant past solutions.

Search docs/solutions/ for relevant past solutions for: <feature_description>
Check tags, categories, and modules for overlap.

=== OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS (MANDATORY) ===
Write your COMPLETE findings to: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/agents/learnings.md
After writing the file, return ONLY a 2-3 sentence summary.
"
```

**DO NOT call TaskOutput to retrieve full results.** Monitor completion by checking file existence:

```bash
ls $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/agents/
```

When each background Task completion notification arrives, capture stats: extract `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, and `duration_ms` values from the `<usage>` notification and run `bash capture-stats.sh ... "<usage-string>"` with agent=`repo-research-analyst` step=`"repo-research-analyst"` model=`sonnet`, and agent=`learnings-researcher` step=`"learnings-researcher"` model=`sonnet`. If `<usage>` is absent, pass `"null"` as the 9th argument. Increment dispatch counter for each.

### 1.5. Research Decision

Based on signals from Step 0 and local research files:

- **High-risk topics** (security, payments, external APIs) → always do external research
- **Strong local context** → skip external research
- **Uncertainty** → research

### 1.5b. External Research (Conditional, Disk-Persisted)

If external research is needed:

```
Task best-practices-researcher (run_in_background: true): "
You are a best practices researcher specializing in external documentation and community standards.

Research best practices for: <feature_description>

=== OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS (MANDATORY) ===
Write your COMPLETE findings to: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/agents/best-practices.md
After writing the file, return ONLY a 2-3 sentence summary.
"

Task framework-docs-researcher (run_in_background: true): "
You are a framework documentation researcher specializing in official docs and version-specific constraints.

Research framework documentation for: <feature_description>

=== OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS (MANDATORY) ===
Write your COMPLETE findings to: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/agents/framework-docs.md
After writing the file, return ONLY a 2-3 sentence summary.
"
```

When each background Task completion notification arrives (if these agents were dispatched), capture stats: extract `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, and `duration_ms` values from the `<usage>` notification and run `bash capture-stats.sh ... "<usage-string>"` with agent=`best-practices-researcher` step=`"best-practices-researcher"` model=`sonnet`, and agent=`framework-docs-researcher` step=`"framework-docs-researcher"` model=`sonnet`. If `<usage>` is absent, pass `"null"` as the 9th argument. Increment dispatch counter for each.

### 1.6. Consolidate Research

**Read the research output files from disk** (not from conversation context):

```bash
ls $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/agents/
# Then use Read tool on each file
```

Consolidate:
- Relevant file paths from repo research
- Institutional learnings from docs/solutions/
- External documentation URLs and best practices
- CLAUDE.md conventions

#### Research Gate: Resolve Unknowns

If research surfaced contradictions, unknowns, or open questions:

For each, present to the user via **AskUserQuestion**:

"Research found: [contradiction or unknown]. How should we handle this?"
- **Resolve now** — make a decision and document it, including the user's reasoning
- **Defer with rationale** — carry into the plan's Open Questions section with the user's stated reason for deferral
- **Not relevant** — discard

**Do not proceed to planning with unresolved research contradictions.** Every finding must be explicitly addressed. When recording resolutions, capture *why* the user chose that path — not just the choice itself.

### 2. Issue Planning & Structure

**Title & Categorization:**
- Draft clear title using conventional format (e.g., `feat: Add user authentication`)
- Convert to filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-<type>-<descriptive-name>-plan.md`

**Content Planning:**
- Choose detail level: MINIMAL / MORE / A LOT (see templates below)
- List all sections needed

### 3. SpecFlow Analysis (Disk-Persisted)

```
Task spec-flow-analyzer (run_in_background: true): "
You are a specification flow analyst specializing in completeness, edge cases, and user flow gaps.

Analyze this feature specification for completeness, edge cases, and user flow gaps:

Feature: <feature_description>

Read the research findings from: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/agents/
Use them to inform your analysis.

=== OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS (MANDATORY) ===
Write your COMPLETE analysis to: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/agents/specflow.md
After writing the file, return ONLY a 2-3 sentence summary.
"
```

When the background Task completion notification arrives, capture stats: extract `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, and `duration_ms` values from the `<usage>` notification and run `bash capture-stats.sh ... "<usage-string>"` with agent=`spec-flow-analyzer` step=`"spec-flow-analyzer"` model=cached (inherit agent). If `<usage>` is absent, pass `"null"` as the 9th argument. Increment dispatch counter.

Read the specflow output file. Incorporate gaps and edge cases into the plan.

### 4. Choose Detail Level

#### MINIMAL (Quick Issue)
Problem statement, acceptance criteria, essential context.

#### MORE (Standard Issue)
Everything from MINIMAL plus: background, technical considerations, success metrics, dependencies.

#### A LOT (Comprehensive Issue)
Everything from MORE plus: implementation phases, alternatives considered, risk analysis, resource requirements.

### 5. Write the Plan

Write to: `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<type>-<descriptive-name>-plan.md`

Include YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: [Plan Title]
type: [feat|fix|refactor]
status: active
date: YYYY-MM-DD
origin: docs/brainstorms/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-brainstorm.md  # if originated from brainstorm, otherwise omit
---
```

Include a **Sources** section at the end of the plan:
- **Origin brainstorm:** `docs/brainstorms/<filename>` — if the plan originated from a brainstorm, link it and summarize 2-3 key decisions carried forward
- Research files, related docs, external references

Use task lists (`- [ ]`) for trackable items that can be checked off during `/do:work`.

### 6. Retain Research

**Do NOT delete research outputs.** The research directory at `$WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/` is retained for traceability and learning. Future sessions, deepen-plan runs, and work execution can reference the original research that informed the plan.

### 6.5. Pre-Handoff Gates

#### Brainstorm Cross-Check (if plan originated from a brainstorm)

Re-read the brainstorm document and verify:
- [ ] Every key decision from the brainstorm is reflected in the plan
- [ ] The chosen approach matches what was decided in the brainstorm
- [ ] Constraints and requirements are captured in acceptance criteria
- [ ] Open/deferred questions from the brainstorm are either resolved or flagged
- [ ] The `origin:` frontmatter field points to the brainstorm file
- [ ] The Sources section includes the brainstorm with carried-forward decisions

If anything was dropped, add it to the plan before proceeding.

#### Plan Open Questions Gate

If the plan has an Open Questions section, resolve each item via **AskUserQuestion**:
- **Resolve now** — answer it with the user's reasoning and remove from Open Questions
- **Defer with rationale** — keep in Open Questions with the user's explicit rationale; flag at handoff
- **Remove** — no longer relevant

**The goal is zero untriaged items at handoff.** Every question must be explicitly resolved, deferred by the user, or removed. Nothing should remain open by accident — if it's in the plan, the user has seen it and made a call. Deferred items are fine when the user consciously chooses to defer, but flag them clearly so `/do:work` knows what's unresolved.

### 6.7. Plan Readiness Check

Run plan readiness checks and aggregate findings to verify the plan is work-ready. The command dispatches all checks directly (flat dispatch — no nested agent dispatch).

**Dispatch:**

1. Read config from compound-workflows.md under the `## Plan Readiness` heading. Read flat keys (`plan_readiness_skip_checks`, `plan_readiness_provenance_expiry_days`, `plan_readiness_verification_source_policy`) and construct the parameter objects to pass to agents. Apply skip_checks filtering.
2. Use `$PLUGIN_ROOT` resolved in the Stats Setup section above.
3. Create output directory: `mkdir -p $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/readiness/checks/`
4. Run 3 mechanical check scripts in parallel (bash), using the resolved `$PLUGIN_ROOT`:
   - `$PLUGIN_ROOT/agents/workflow/plan-checks/stale-values.sh <plan-path> <output-dir>/checks/stale-values.md`
   - `$PLUGIN_ROOT/agents/workflow/plan-checks/broken-references.sh <plan-path> <output-dir>/checks/broken-references.md`
   - `$PLUGIN_ROOT/agents/workflow/plan-checks/audit-trail-bloat.sh <plan-path> <output-dir>/checks/audit-trail-bloat.md`
5. If all 5 semantic passes are in skip_checks, skip the semantic agent dispatch entirely. Otherwise, dispatch 1 semantic checks agent (background Task):
   - Agent: `$PLUGIN_ROOT/agents/workflow/plan-checks/semantic-checks.md`
   - Pass: plan file path, output path (`<output-dir>/checks/semantic-checks.md`), mode (`full`), skip_checks, provenance settings
   - When the background Task completion notification arrives, capture stats: extract `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, and `duration_ms` values from the `<usage>` notification and run `bash capture-stats.sh ... "<usage-string>"` with agent=`semantic-checks` step=`"semantic-checks"` model=cached (inherit agent). If `<usage>` is absent, pass `"null"` as the 9th argument. Increment dispatch counter.
5. Wait for all checks to complete (3-minute timeout for scripts, 5-10 minutes for semantic agent due to WebSearch latency). After timeout, remove any orphaned .tmp files: `rm -f <output-dir>/checks/*.tmp`. If rate limits are hit, retry with exponential backoff.
6. Dispatch plan-readiness-reviewer (foreground Task):
   - Pass: plan file path, plan stem, output directory, check output file paths, mode, config
   - After the foreground Task response, capture stats: extract `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, and `duration_ms` values from the `<usage>` notification and run `bash capture-stats.sh ... "<usage-string>"` with agent=`plan-readiness-reviewer` step=`"plan-readiness-reviewer"` model=cached (inherit agent). If `<usage>` is absent, pass `"null"` as the 9th argument. Increment dispatch counter.
7. Show the reviewer's summary to the user: "Plan readiness check: [summary]"

Keep Phase 6.7 focused on dispatch + response handling. The detailed analysis logic lives in the check scripts and agent files.

**If issues found:**

1. Dispatch plan-consolidator (foreground). Pass: plan file path, reviewer report path, consolidation report output path.
   After the foreground Task response, capture stats: extract `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, and `duration_ms` values from the `<usage>` notification and run `bash capture-stats.sh ... "<usage-string>"` with agent=`plan-consolidator` step=`"plan-consolidator"` model=cached (inherit agent). If `<usage>` is absent, pass `"null"` as the 9th argument. Increment dispatch counter.
2. Consolidator applies auto-fixes, then presents guardrailed items to user.
3. After consolidation, re-run checks in `verify-only` mode: re-run all 3 mechanical scripts (type: mechanical), re-dispatch semantic agent with `mode: verify-only` (runs contradictions + underspecification only; skips unresolved-disputes, accretion, external-verification). Dispatch reviewer again.
   - When the semantic-checks verify background Task completion notification arrives, capture stats: extract `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, and `duration_ms` values from the `<usage>` notification and run `bash capture-stats.sh ... "<usage-string>"` with agent=`semantic-checks` step=`"semantic-checks-verify"` model=cached. If `<usage>` is absent, pass `"null"` as the 9th argument. Increment dispatch counter.
   - After the plan-readiness-reviewer verify foreground Task response, capture stats: extract `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, and `duration_ms` values from the `<usage>` notification and run `bash capture-stats.sh ... "<usage-string>"` with agent=`plan-readiness-reviewer` step=`"plan-readiness-reviewer-verify"` model=cached. If `<usage>` is absent, pass `"null"` as the 9th argument. Increment dispatch counter.
4. If verify finds new issues: present remaining findings to user directly.
   User options: resolve now, defer to Open Questions, or dismiss.
5. **Track deferred finding severities** for Phase 7 recommendation: when the user defers a finding, note its severity level (CRITICAL, SERIOUS, MINOR). Carry these deferred severity counts forward to Phase 7 alongside the final reviewer summary.
6. Show user: "Readiness check complete. N auto-fixes applied, M items resolved, K deferred."

**If zero issues found:**

Skip consolidator and re-verify. Show: "Plan readiness check: no issues found."

**If reviewer fails:**

Warn: "Readiness check failed — consider running /do:deepen-plan before starting work."
Proceed to Phase 7.

### 6.8. Red Team Challenge (Optional)

After the readiness check, challenge the plan with three different model providers in parallel. The research and review agents are all Claude-based and share similar training biases — different models catch blind spots they'd collectively miss. Using three providers maximizes coverage.

**AskUserQuestion:** "Run a red team challenge on this plan? Three different AI models will challenge the reasoning. (~5-6 min when clean, ~8-12 min if findings need triage)"
- **Yes** — proceed with red team
- **Skip** — go directly to Phase 7

**If the user declines**, skip to Phase 7.

**If Phase 6.7 readiness check failed:** Still offer the gate, but add context: "Note: readiness check was incomplete. Red team reviews plan reasoning, not structural quality."

#### 6.8.1: SHA-256 Hash Capture

Before launching red team, capture the plan file hash for later comparison:

```bash
shasum -a 256 <plan-path>
```

Read the first field of the output as the plan hash. Track this value as PLAN_HASH_BEFORE.

#### 6.8.2: Runtime CLI Detection + 3-Provider Dispatch

Launch all three providers in parallel. Each reviews independently — no provider reads another's critique. This maximizes diversity of perspective (reading prior critiques anchors models and reduces independent insight). Deduplication happens at triage.

**Runtime detection:** For Gemini and OpenAI providers, detect which dispatch method is available. Check once per session; if multiple options exist for a provider, ask the user which they prefer (e.g., `clink gemini` for direct file access, or `pal chat` with a specific model like `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`).

```bash
which gemini 2>/dev/null && echo "GEMINI_CLI=available" || echo "GEMINI_CLI=not_available"
which codex 2>/dev/null && echo "CODEX_CLI=available" || echo "CODEX_CLI=not_available"
# PAL: check if mcp__pal__chat is available as a tool  # context-lean-exempt
```

**Provider 1 — Gemini:**

**Provider 3 — Claude Opus (via Agent subagent, NOT PAL):**

Do NOT use PAL for Claude — use an Agent subagent instead (direct file access, no token relay overhead):

Agent(subagent_type: "general-purpose", run_in_background: true, prompt: "
You are a red team reviewer for a software implementation plan. Your job is to find flaws, not validate. Approach this adversarially — assume the plan has weaknesses and find them.

Read the plan at: <plan_path>
Optionally read research files at: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/agents/ — for additional context on contradictions between research findings and the plan.

Then identify:
1. **Unexamined assumptions** — What does the plan take for granted?
2. **Architecture risks** — Where could the technical approach fail at scale or under pressure?
3. **Missing steps** — What implementation work is implied but not planned?
4. **Dependency risks** — What external factors could derail the plan?
5. **Overengineering** — Where is the plan more complex than necessary? Is it doing more than what was asked? Did research agents or prior analysis introduce unnecessary complexity?
6. **Contradictions** — Do research findings conflict with each other or the plan? Does the plan contradict itself?
7. **Problem selection** — Is this the right problem to solve? Were alternatives to the entire approach considered?

Be specific. Reference plan sections by name. Rate each finding:
- CRITICAL — Plan will fail or produce wrong outcome if not addressed
- SERIOUS — Significant risk that should be addressed before implementation
- MINOR — Worth noting for awareness

")
```

**Execution:** Launch all three as background Agents in a single message. Wait for all to complete before proceeding to Step 6.8.3.

**DO NOT call TaskOutput to retrieve red team results.** Monitor completion by polling for output files:

```bash
ls $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/red-team--*.md 2>/dev/null
```

When all expected red team files exist (up to 3), proceed to Step 6.8.3. If a task-notification arrives, note it but check for the output file rather than processing the notification content.

When each background Agent completion notification arrives, capture stats: extract `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, and `duration_ms` values from the `<usage>` notification and run `bash capture-stats.sh ... "<usage-string>"` for each completed provider. If `<usage>` is absent, pass `"null"` as the 9th argument:
- Gemini: agent=`red-team-relay` step=`"red-team-relay-gemini"` model=`sonnet`
- OpenAI: agent=`red-team-relay` step=`"red-team-relay-openai"` model=`sonnet`
- Claude Opus: agent=`general-purpose` step=`"red-team-opus"` model=cached (inherit agent)
Increment dispatch counter for each.

**Provider failure fallback chain:**
1. All 3 providers available — normal 3-provider red team
2. Gemini/OpenAI fail — Opus-only red team (proceed with whatever completed)
3. Opus also fails — treat as "red team was skipped" — decision tree applies normal rules

**If PAL MCP is not available:** Run only the Claude Opus Agent subagent (Provider 3 above). The red team will have a single perspective instead of three, but this is an acceptable fallback.

**Timeout:** Set a 5-minute timeout per provider agent. If a provider hasn't produced output after 5 minutes, proceed with whatever providers completed. Log any timeouts in the recommendation log. If all providers time out, treat as "red team failed" and proceed to Phase 7 with red team status "failed." For timed-out providers, call `capture-stats.sh --timeout` with the appropriate agent/step values. Increment dispatch counter for each.

#### 6.8.3: CRITICAL and SERIOUS Triage

Read all red team files from disk. Deduplicate findings across providers — if multiple models flag the same issue, note it once with the strongest severity rating.

For each CRITICAL or SERIOUS item, present to the user via **AskUserQuestion**:

"[Challenge summary — note which provider(s) flagged it]. How should we handle this?"
- **Valid — update the plan** (edit the plan to address it)
- **Disagree — note why** (add a footnote with the counterargument including the user's reasoning)
- **Defer — flag for implementation** (add to Open Questions section with the concern)

Apply the user's decision to the plan file. **Include the user's stated reasoning** — not just "disagreed" but *why* (e.g., "Disagreed: user noted the plan already handles this via the retry middleware in Phase 3"). The rationale is more valuable than the verdict — it prevents future sessions from relitigating settled decisions.

**Provenance pointers:** `[red-team--<provider>, see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/red-team--<provider>.md]`. For findings flagged by multiple providers, list all provider names with one path (e.g., `[red-team--gemini, red-team--opus, see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/red-team--gemini.md]`).

**Track deferred severity counts separately** as "red team deferred" (distinct from "readiness deferred"). "Deferred" = unresolved for decision tree purposes. "Valid" and "Disagree" are both resolved (user took action). "Defer" leaves the finding as an open risk.

#### 6.8.4: MINOR Three-Category Triage

After all CRITICAL and SERIOUS items are resolved, check for MINOR findings across all red team critiques.

If no MINOR findings exist, skip to Step 6.8.6.

**Step 3a: Dispatch MINOR categorization subagent.**

```
Agent(subagent_type: "general-purpose", prompt: "
You are a MINOR finding triage agent reviewing red team findings for a plan. Your job is to categorize each MINOR finding and propose fixes where possible.

## Source Files

Read all red team files from: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/
- red-team--gemini.md
- red-team--openai.md
- red-team--opus.md

(Read whichever red team files exist — some providers may have failed.)

Read the plan at: <plan_path>

## Categorization

Deduplicate MINOR findings across providers — if multiple models flag the same issue, note it once with provider attribution. For each unique MINOR finding, categorize it into one of three categories:

### Category 1: Fixable Now
The finding suggests a concrete edit that meets all three criteria:
1. **Unambiguous** — only one reasonable fix exists
2. **Low effort** — a one-line or few-line edit, not a structural change
3. **Low risk** — safe to change without ripple effects; no user decisions or reasoning involved

For each fixable item, provide BOTH:
- `old_string`: the text currently in the plan to replace
- `new_string`: the corrected text

### Category 2: Needs Manual Review
Valid finding but fails at least one fixability criterion. Note which criterion fails and which provider(s) flagged it.

### Category 3: No Action Needed
Observation with no concrete edit implied. Note why (e.g., 'already addressed in Phase 3', 'cosmetic preference not a deficiency', 'out of scope for this plan').

## Conflict Detection
If two fixable items propose conflicting edits to the same section, re-categorize both as 'needs manual review' with the conflict noted.

## Output Format

Write your categorization to: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/minor-triage-redteam.md

Use this structure (numbers are sequential across all categories):

# MINOR Triage Categorization (Red Team)

## Summary
- Total: N MINOR findings (deduplicated from P providers)
- Fixable now: M items
- Needs manual review: K items
- No action needed: J items

## Fixable Now

### 1. [Finding summary]
- Source: [provider(s)]
- Proposed fix: [concrete edit — what to change, where in the document]
- Location: [section/heading in plan]
- old_string: |
  [exact text in plan to replace]
- new_string: |
  [corrected text]

## Needs Manual Review

### M+1. [Finding summary]
- Source: [provider(s)]
- Why manual: [which fixability criterion fails]

## No Action Needed

### M+K+1. [Finding summary]
- Source: [provider(s)]
- Reason: [why no action is needed]

=== OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS (MANDATORY) ===
Write your COMPLETE categorization to: $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/minor-triage-redteam.md
After writing the file, return ONLY a 2-3 sentence summary.
DO NOT return your full analysis in your response. The file IS the output.
")
```

After the foreground Agent response, capture stats: extract `total_tokens`, `tool_uses`, and `duration_ms` values from the `<usage>` notification and run `bash capture-stats.sh ... "<usage-string>"` with agent=`general-purpose` step=`"red-team-minor-triage"` model=cached (inherit agent). If `<usage>` is absent, pass `"null"` as the 9th argument. Increment dispatch counter.

**Step 3b: Present three-category triage to user.** Read the categorization file from `$WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/minor-triage-redteam.md`. Present to the user (omit any empty category section):

**AskUserQuestion:**

"N MINOR findings from red team review:

**Fixable now** (M items):
1. [summary] → [proposed edit]
2. [summary] → [proposed edit]

**Needs manual review** (K items):
3. [summary]

**No action needed** (J items):
4. [summary] — [reason]

What would you like to do?"

Options:
1. **Apply all fixes + acknowledge no-action items** (Recommended)
2. **Apply specific fixes** (e.g., "1, 2") + acknowledge rest
3. **Review all individually**
4. **Acknowledge all** (no fixes)

**Edge cases:**
- **Zero fixable items:** Omit "Fixable now" section. Remove "Apply all fixes" option. Recommend "Review all individually" if manual-review items exist, or "Acknowledge all" if only no-action items.
- **All fixable items:** Omit empty sections.
- **User rejects all proposed fixes:** Record as `**Acknowledged (batch):**` with "(M fixable declined)" annotation.

**Partial acceptance parsing:** Interpret the user's natural language response (e.g., "1, 3", "all except 2", "first two"). If ambiguous, ask for clarification rather than guessing.

**Step 3c: Apply fixes and verify.** For each accepted fix:

1. Apply using the Edit tool with the `old_string`/`new_string` from the categorization output (one edit per fix, sequential).
2. After all edits applied, re-read the modified sections of the plan.
3. Verify each applied edit matches the proposal by content (not line number — earlier edits may shift lines).
4. If drift detected (edit doesn't match proposal), flag to user before proceeding.

**Step 3d: Present "needs manual review" items individually.** For each item categorized as "needs manual review," present via **AskUserQuestion** with the same options as CRITICAL/SERIOUS findings (Step 6.8.3):

"[Finding summary — note which provider(s) flagged it]. How should we handle this?"
- **Valid — update the plan** (edit the plan to address it)
- **Disagree — note why** (add a footnote with the counterargument)
- **Defer — flag for implementation** (add to Open Questions section with the concern)

Apply the user's decision to the plan file. Include the user's stated reasoning.

**MINOR triage provenance formats:**
- **Applied fixes:** `**Fixed (batch):** M MINOR red team fixes applied. [see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/minor-triage-redteam.md]`
- **No-action items:** `**Acknowledged (batch):** J MINOR red team findings, no action needed. [see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/minor-triage-redteam.md]`
- **User declines all fixes:** `**Acknowledged (batch):** N MINOR red team findings accepted (M fixable declined). [see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/minor-triage-redteam.md]`
- **Partial acceptance:** `**Fixed (batch):** M of N fixable MINOR red team items applied (items 1, 3). [see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/minor-triage-redteam.md]`
- **Manual review items:** individual resolution lines using the Step 6.8.3 provenance pointer format: `[red-team--<provider>, see $WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/red-team--<provider>.md]`

#### 6.8.5: Timeout Handling

Set a 5-minute timeout per provider agent. If a provider hasn't produced output after 5 minutes, proceed with whatever providers completed. Log any timeouts in the recommendation log. If all providers time out, treat as "red team failed" and proceed to Phase 7 with red team status "failed."

#### 6.8.6: SHA-256 Hash Comparison

After all triage is complete, compare the plan file hash to detect edits:

```bash
shasum -a 256 <plan-path>
```

Read the first field of the output as the plan hash. Track this value as PLAN_HASH_AFTER. Compare PLAN_HASH_BEFORE and PLAN_HASH_AFTER: if they differ, the plan changed (proceed to Phase 6.9); if equal, the plan is unchanged (skip to Phase 7).

The hash comparison is intentionally coarse — any edit triggers re-check, including MINOR fixes. The cost of a false positive (unnecessary re-check after a typo fix) is ~5-10 min; the cost of a false negative (missing structural edit) could result in implementing a broken plan.

If `PLAN_CHANGED=true`, proceed to Phase 6.9. If `PLAN_CHANGED=false`, skip to Phase 7.

### 6.9. Conditional Readiness Re-Check

**Gate:** Check `PLAN_CHANGED` from Phase 6.8.6 hash comparison.

- If `PLAN_CHANGED=false`: Show "Plan unchanged during red team triage — skipping re-check." Skip to Phase 7.
- If `PLAN_CHANGED=true`: Show "Plan was modified during red team triage. Running full readiness re-check."

**Dispatch:** Re-run Phase 6.7's complete readiness dispatch with these differences:

1. **Output directory:** `$WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/readiness/re-check/checks/` (NOT Phase 6.7's `$WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/readiness/checks/`). Both passes are preserved for traceability.
2. **Mode:** Full readiness (same as Phase 6.7 — all 3 mechanical scripts + full 5-pass semantic agent + reviewer + consolidator if issues found). NOT verify-only.

**Stats capture for re-check dispatches:** Use `"-recheck"` step suffixes to distinguish from Phase 6.7:
- Semantic-checks agent (background Task): agent=`semantic-checks` step=`"semantic-checks-recheck"` model=cached. Increment dispatch counter.
- plan-readiness-reviewer (foreground Task): agent=`plan-readiness-reviewer` step=`"plan-readiness-reviewer-recheck"` model=cached. Increment dispatch counter.
- plan-consolidator (foreground Task, if issues found): agent=`plan-consolidator` step=`"plan-consolidator-recheck"` model=cached. Increment dispatch counter.

**Triage:** Same process as Phase 6.7 — present consolidated findings, resolve/defer/dismiss each.

**Deferred severity tracking:** Re-check findings are readiness-type issues (structural/consistency) even though they were caused by red team edits. Track re-check deferred severities under the **readiness** counter, not the red team counter.

**Loop cap:** No further re-check after this cycle. If re-check finds issues:
1. Consolidator runs (if issues found)
2. User triages findings (resolve/defer/dismiss)
3. Proceed to Phase 7 — do NOT re-hash or re-check again

This prevents infinite loops: red team → triage edits → re-check → triage edits → re-check → ... The single re-check pass catches structural regressions from red team fixes. Any remaining issues surface in Phase 7's recommendation as deferred readiness findings.

### 6.95. Stats Validation

If stats capture is enabled, validate entry count against dispatch counter:

```bash
bash $PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/validate-stats.sh "$STATS_FILE" <DISPATCH_COUNT>
```

If validate-stats.sh reports a mismatch, warn with the names of missing agents (not just the count delta). Do not fail the command. Account for conditional dispatches — only count agents that were actually dispatched (external research 0-2, consolidator 0-1, verify 0-2, red team 0-4, re-check 0-3).

### 7. Post-Generation Options

**If any items were deferred:**
Flag them explicitly: "Note: N deferred items remain in the plan. `/do:work` will surface these before execution — the orchestrator may need to pause and ask you to resolve them."

**Work readiness note:** Before presenting options, assess whether the plan's steps are well-sized for `/do:work` (subagent dispatch). Flag if:
- Any step has 20+ checkboxes or heavy inline specs — suggest splitting during work setup
- Steps share large reference data — note that the orchestrator should point subagents to the file path, not inline the data
- Steps can run in parallel (touch separate files with no dependencies) — note the opportunity

#### Recommendation Computation

Compute the recommended next step by evaluating the following decision tree **in order** (first match wins). Use data from Phase 6.7: the reviewer's severity summary (in context from foreground dispatch), deferred finding severities (tracked per step 5 above), and post-verify severity counts (if verify ran).

**Additional data to gather at Phase 7 time:**

1. **Brainstorm existence:** Read the plan file's YAML frontmatter. If `origin:` exists and points to a `docs/brainstorms/*.md` file, a brainstorm exists. Otherwise, no brainstorm preceded this plan.
2. **Step count:** Count the top-level numbered sections in the plan's implementation section (the items that become `/do:work` execution units — the same ones assessed in the work readiness note above).
3. **Red team status:** Did red team run? (yes/no from Yes/Skip gate)
4. **Red team deferred CRITICAL count** (from Phase 6.8)
5. **Red team deferred SERIOUS count** (from Phase 6.8)
6. **Plan modified by red team:** yes/no (from SHA-256 comparison)
7. **Re-check ran:** yes/no (from Phase 6.9 conditional)
8. **Re-check deferred severities** (from Phase 6.9, if it ran)

**Decision tree (evaluate in order, first match wins):**

1. **Reviewer failed or was skipped** → Recommend: deepen-plan
   - Message: "Readiness check incomplete — deepen-plan recommended to verify plan quality."

2. **Any CRITICAL finding remains (readiness or red team, active or deferred)** → Recommend: deepen-plan
   - Message: "N CRITICAL findings remain (check-categories). Deepen-plan recommended."
   - Example: "2 CRITICAL red team findings remain (overengineering, problem selection). Deepen-plan recommended."

3. **Any SERIOUS finding remains (readiness or red team, active or deferred)** → Recommend: deepen-plan
   - Message: "N SERIOUS findings remain (check-categories). Deepen-plan recommended."
   - Example: "1 SERIOUS readiness finding remains (stale-values). Deepen-plan recommended."

4. **Red team ran and clean (no unresolved CRITICAL/SERIOUS from any source) → Recommend: work**
   - Message: "Plan passed readiness checks and survived red team challenge — ready for work."

   **Rule 4 vs Rule 5 interaction:** If Phase 6.7 consolidator materially modified the plan (resolving CRITICAL/SERIOUS) but Phase 6.8 red team then validated the modified plan (clean), rule 4 fires first and recommends work. The red team IS the adversarial validation that rule 5 was routing to deepen-plan for. Rule 5 only fires when consolidator materially modified the plan AND the user skipped red team — leaving the modifications unvalidated.

5. **Consolidator resolved CRITICAL or SERIOUS findings (plan materially modified) and verify passed clean + red team not run** → Recommend: deepen-plan
   - Detect by comparing: initial reviewer had CRITICAL or SERIOUS counts > 0, post-verify counts are 0 for those severities.
   - Message: "Red team not run — plan was modified during readiness checks. Deepen-plan recommended to review changes."

6. **No brainstorm origin AND plan has 4+ top-level implementation steps AND red team not run** → Recommend: deepen-plan
   - Message: "Red team not run — no brainstorm preceded this plan. Deepen-plan recommended to catch unvalidated assumptions."

7. **Clean or MINOR-only findings, brainstorm exists or plan is small (< 4 steps)** → Recommend: work
   - Message: "Plan readiness checks passed — ready for work. Deepen-plan available for adversarial review if desired (~2-5 min, agent swarm + red team)."

#### Handoff

Use **AskUserQuestion tool**:

**Question:** "Plan ready at `[plan_path]`. [Recommendation message from decision tree above.] [Any work-readiness flags, e.g., 'Note: Steps 7-8 are large — the `/do:work` orchestrator should split them into smaller issues.'] What would you like to do next?"

**Options** (annotate exactly one with `**[Recommended]**` based on the decision tree result):
1. **Run `/do:deepen-plan`** — Enhance with parallel research agents **[Recommended]** ← if decision tree recommends deepen-plan
2. **Review and refine** — Improve through structured self-review
3. **Start `/do:work`** — Begin implementing this plan **[Recommended]** ← if decision tree recommends work [If CRITICAL readiness findings were deferred, always append: "— Warning: unresolved CRITICAL findings"]
4. **Create Issue** — Create issue in project tracker (GitHub/Linear)

The `**[Recommended]**` annotation appears on exactly one option per run (never zero, never two). The option order is fixed — only the annotation moves.

#### Feedback Loop

After the user responds to the AskUserQuestion above, append an entry to `$WORKFLOWS_ROOT/plan-research/<plan-stem>/recommendation-log.md` to track recommendation accuracy for future calibration:

```markdown
## <date>
- Readiness severity counts: N CRITICAL, N SERIOUS, N MINOR (final state)
- Readiness deferred: N CRITICAL, N SERIOUS (if any)
- Red team ran: yes/no
- Red team severity counts: N CRITICAL, N SERIOUS, N MINOR (if ran)
- Red team deferred: N CRITICAL, N SERIOUS (if any)
- Plan modified by red team: yes/no
- Re-check ran: yes/no
- Consolidator materially modified plan: yes/no
- Brainstorm origin: yes/no
- Step count: N
- Recommendation: <option> [Recommended]
- User choice: <option selected>
```

The "Consolidator materially modified plan" field is "yes" if the consolidator resolved any CRITICAL or SERIOUS findings (material modification per decision tree rule 5), "no" otherwise.

## Key Principles

- **Zero untriaged items at handoff** — every open question, contradiction, or finding must be explicitly resolved, deferred by the user, or removed. Nothing slips through unseen. Deferred items are acceptable when the user consciously chooses to defer — but they must be flagged clearly so `/do:work` knows what's unresolved.
- **The brainstorm is the origin document** — if a brainstorm exists, the plan must trace back to it via `origin:` frontmatter and carry forward all decisions
- **Research informs, gates enforce** — research agents surface findings, but gates ensure nothing slips through unaddressed
- **Record the why, not just the what** — when the user makes a decision, explains a preference, or rejects an alternative, capture their reasoning in the plan. User rationale evaporates with conversation context; the plan is the only durable record.

NEVER CODE! Just research and write the plan.
