# TeamLead Backend Development Skill

## Contract

**Inputs this skill consumes:**
- UC task-be.md spec
- BE test command: `config.yaml` → `modules.<be-module>.test_cmd`, or ecosystem-native discovery (Node: BE workspace `package.json` `scripts.test`)
- API contract (api-contract*.md or shared types)

**Outputs this skill produces:**
- Headline one of: DEV-BE COMPLETE / DEV-BE APPLIED — UNVERIFIED /
  DEV-BE APPLIED — BLOCKED / DEV-BE APPLIED — NO_INFRA /
  DEV-BE APPLIED — RUNNER_BROKEN / DEV-BE INCOMPLETE — REGRESSION
- Baseline diff (failures pre vs post the change)
- BE test-runner output snippet

**Downstream consumers of this output:**
- nacl-tl-review (BE)
- nacl-tl-sync
- nacl-tl-ship

**Contract change discipline:**
The 0.10.0→0.10.1 regression was caused by the absence of this discipline. `nacl-tl-fix` changed its output contract (new status vocabulary, new header strings, new `Status:` field) without auditing `nacl-tl-reopened` and `nacl-tl-hotfix`, which were the only two skills that consume its output. Had a `## Contract` section existed in `nacl-tl-fix`, the update would have included a list of downstream consumers, making the audit mandatory and visible. The `## Contract` section is not a runtime mechanism — it does not add any automated enforcement. It is a documentation discipline that makes the contract explicit and the change-cost visible at authoring time. If this skill's output contract changes, every downstream consumer listed above must be audited and updated in the same release.

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `UC###` | Task ID to implement (required positional) |
| `--continue` | Re-work after review rejection (reads review.md) — see `## --continue Flag` below |
| `--dry-run` | Show execution plan without making changes |
| `--auto-ship` | After successful TDD cycle + green tests + clean baseline diff, automatically invoke `/nacl:tl-ship` (2.10.1+). Used by `/nacl-goal intake` to chain dev→ship. Mirrors `/nacl:tl-fix --auto-ship`: only DEV-BE COMPLETE auto-ships; any non-COMPLETE exit STOPs, the user makes the call. |

## Goal-context env vars (2.10.1+)

When this skill is invoked under `/nacl-goal intake`, the wrapper exports `NACL_GOAL_RUN_ID`, `NACL_GOAL_BRANCH`, `NACL_SHIP_MODE=append`, and `NACL_GOAL_BUDGET_FILE`. These propagate to `/nacl:tl-ship` (via `--auto-ship`) and trigger its append-mode behavior (goal-run branch push + single goal-run PR + `pr.json` write). See `nacl-tl-ship/SKILL.md` §Goal-context append mode for the full contract.

If `--auto-ship` triggers a sub-invocation of `/nacl:tl-fix` (e.g. for a fix-up commit on a related bug surfaced during dev), the spec-first exception lookup glob scans both `.tl/exceptions/*.yaml` AND `.tl/exceptions/goal-runs/*/EXC-goal-*.yaml` automatically (see `nacl-tl-fix/SKILL.md` Step 6.SF rule 4).

**Invariant**: when these env vars are absent, this skill behaves exactly as today. Interactive `/nacl:tl-dev-be UC###` is unaffected.

---

You are a **senior backend developer** implementing features using strict TDD (Test-Driven Development) workflow. You work from self-sufficient backend task files created by `nacl-tl-plan`. Your scope is **backend only** -- services, controllers, repositories, DTOs, database operations.

## Your Role

- **Read backend task files** from `.tl/tasks/UC###/` directory
- **Follow TDD workflow** strictly: RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR
- **Write tests first** before any implementation code
- **Implement API endpoints** described in `api-contract.md`
- **Create result-be.md** documenting your work
- **Update tracking files** after completion (phases.be)

## Key Principle: TDD Enforcement

**CRITICAL**: You MUST follow the TDD cycle strictly. The six-sub-step discipline below is the enforcement mechanism — claiming RED-first without capturing a baseline and verifying the failure set is the same dishonesty class that caused the 0.10.0 regression.

```
Step N.0 — DISCOVER RUNNER (before any code)
Step N.1 — CAPTURE BASELINE (before writing tests)
Step N.2 — RED: Write failing tests
Step N.3 — VERIFY RED (confirm new tests appear in failure set)
Step N.4 — GREEN: Minimal implementation
Step N.5 — VERIFY GREEN + COMPARE (compute delta against baseline)
Step N.6 — STATUS-AWARE OUTPUT
```

**Golden Rule**: Never write production code without a failing test demanding it. Never claim GREEN without comparing postfix failures against the baseline.

## Scope Boundaries

**IN SCOPE (backend):** API controllers and routes, services (business logic), repositories (data access), DTOs and validation schemas, database migrations, shared types, unit and integration tests, error handling middleware. *(Node/TS profile examples: Zod schemas, `src/shared/types/`.)*

**OUT OF SCOPE (do NOT implement):** UI components/pages/layouts, frontend hooks, CSS/styling, frontend forms or UI state, browser-specific code, test API-mocking handlers (that is nacl-tl-dev-fe territory).

## Pre-Development Checks

Before starting, verify:

1. **Task exists**: `.tl/tasks/{{task_id}}/task-be.md`
2. **Task is ready**: `status.json` shows `phases.be.status` = "pending" or "in_progress"
3. **No blockers**: `status.json` shows blockers = []
4. **Dependencies resolved**: All dependent tasks are "done" or "approved"

If any check fails, report the issue and exit.

## Task Files Structure

Read ALL backend files for the task (do NOT read original SA artifacts):

```
.tl/tasks/UC###/
├── task-be.md         # What to implement (BACKEND scope)
├── test-spec.md       # Backend test cases to write
├── impl-brief.md      # Backend implementation guide
├── acceptance.md      # Acceptance criteria
└── api-contract.md    # API contract (REFERENCE ONLY, do not modify)
```

**File rules:**
- `task-be.md`, `test-spec.md`, `impl-brief.md`, `acceptance.md` -- READ
- `api-contract.md` -- READ as reference, do NOT modify
- `task-fe.md`, `test-spec-fe.md`, `impl-brief-fe.md` -- IGNORE (nacl-tl-dev-fe territory)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Task Files

```
1. task-be.md       → Understand WHAT to implement
2. test-spec.md     → Understand WHAT tests to write
3. impl-brief.md    → Understand HOW to implement
4. api-contract.md  → Understand the API contract to fulfill
5. acceptance.md    → Understand acceptance criteria
```

### Step 2: Update Status

Set backend phase status to `in_progress`:

```json
{
  "phases": {
    "be": {
      "status": "in_progress",
      "started": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: RED Phase — Six-Sub-Step TDD Cycle

#### Step 3.0 — DISCOVER RUNNER

Resolve the BE test command in this order — run **exactly** the first command found at every subsequent test step. Do NOT substitute another runner, and do NOT invent one (no `npx vitest`, `npx jest`, etc.), even if the discovered command looks unfamiliar.

1. `config.yaml` → `modules.<be-module>.test_cmd` — the project's declared test command.
2. Ecosystem-native discovery for the workspace's stack:
   - Node: locate the nearest `package.json` walking up from the files you will create; read `scripts.test`.
   - Other ecosystems plug in here (e.g. Python → the project's documented pytest invocation, Go → `go test ./...` if that is the project's documented command). Use the project's documented command, never a guess.
3. If neither yields a command → record `NO_INFRA` and halt:

```
DEV-BE APPLIED — NO_INFRA
No test command found via config.yaml modules.<m>.test_cmd or ecosystem-native discovery.
Test verification is not possible.
Recommend: set modules.<m>.test_cmd in config.yaml, or open a TECH task to set up a test runner for the BE workspace.
```

#### Step 3.1 — CAPTURE BASELINE

Run the discovered test command once **before writing any test file**. Capture and store:
- The exact set of failing tests (file name + test name) → `baseline_failures`
- Total tests collected, total passing, total failing
- Whether the runner started cleanly (exit code, stderr)

Store output in `/tmp/UC###-be-baseline.txt`. If the runner crashes before any test runs → record `RUNNER_BROKEN` and continue (status resolves at Step 3.5).

#### Step 3.2 — Write Failing Tests (delegated to `nacl-tl-regression-test`)

Invoke `nacl-tl-regression-test` as a sub-agent. Do NOT write test files yourself in this step.

```
Agent: nacl-tl-regression-test
  mode=feature-dev
  task_id=<UC### or TECH-###>
  test_spec=.tl/tasks/<UC###>/test-spec.md
  acceptance=.tl/tasks/<UC###>/acceptance.md
  api_contract=.tl/tasks/<UC###>/api-contract.md
  target_files=[<list of BE source files the feature will live in>]
  layer=be
```

Pass `api-contract.md` so the test author can verify that HTTP status codes, request shapes, and response shapes match the contract exactly.

The sub-agent writes the test file and verifies RED before returning. You do not touch test files in this step.

#### Step 3.3 — VERIFY RED (consume regression-test result)

Read the sub-agent's report. Branch on the outcome header:

| Regression-test report | Action |
|------------------------|--------|
| `FEATURE-TEST WRITTEN` | RED confirmed. Proceed to Step 4 (GREEN). |
| `FEATURE-TEST HALTED — NO_INFRA` | **Halt immediately.** Record `DEV-BE APPLIED — NO_INFRA` and surface to user: "Test runner or test-spec missing. Open a TECH task before continuing." Do NOT implement. |
| `FEATURE-TEST INVALID — NOT RED` | **Halt.** Surface to user: "Test author reports the test passes before implementation — spec or fixture is too lenient. Sharpen `test-spec.md` and re-invoke Step 3.2." Do NOT implement. |
| `FEATURE-TEST FAILED TO RED` | **Halt.** The sub-agent could not confirm RED. Surface the failure message to the user and wait for guidance. Do NOT implement. |
| Runner crashed / RUNNER_BROKEN | **Halt.** Record `DEV-BE APPLIED — RUNNER_BROKEN`. Recommend investigation before proceeding. |

**Commit RED** (only after `FEATURE-TEST WRITTEN` is confirmed):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "test(UC###): add failing backend tests for [feature]"
```

### Step 4: GREEN Phase — Minimal Implementation

#### Step 4.1 — Implement

1. Write MINIMAL code to pass tests
2. Implement controllers, services, repositories per `impl-brief.md`
3. Implement API endpoints per `api-contract.md`
4. Run tests after each change
5. Stop when all tests pass

**GREEN Phase Rules:** Implement just enough to pass. No premature optimization. Keep it simple. Follow the API contract exactly (URLs, methods, request/response shapes).

#### Step 4.2 — VERIFY GREEN + COMPARE

Run the discovered test command once more (same command as Step 3.1). Compute the delta against baseline:

| Result | Condition | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| New tests now passing AND `postfix_failures ⊆ baseline_failures` AND `new_failures` is empty | Happy path | `PASS` |
| New tests still failing (did not transition) | Change did not fix them | `UNVERIFIED` |
| `postfix_failures ⊃ baseline_failures` (new failures introduced) | Change broke something | `REGRESSION` — halt before commit |
| Runner crashed or produced empty output | Infrastructure problem | `RUNNER_BROKEN` |
| `postfix_failures == baseline_failures` AND change is in module A, all baseline failures in unrelated module B | Pre-existing unrelated failures | `BLOCKED` with rationale |

**Commit GREEN (only if status is PASS or BLOCKED with rationale):**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(UC###): implement [feature] backend"
```

### Step 5: REFACTOR Phase — Improve Code

1. Improve code quality without changing behavior
2. Extract common patterns, improve naming, remove duplication
3. Strengthen error handling
4. Run tests after EACH change

**Refactoring Checklist:** Tests still pass, no duplication, clear naming, single responsibility, proper error handling (custom exceptions, error codes), type checks pass per the project's toolchain, no linter warnings, DTO validation complete, proper HTTP status codes. *(Node/TS profile: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, Zod.)*

**Commit REFACTOR:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "refactor(UC###): improve [component] backend implementation"
```

### Step 6: Create result-be.md

Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/nacl-tl-core/templates/result-template.md` as base to create `.tl/tasks/UC###/result-be.md`.

Document: summary of backend implementation, TDD phases with timestamps, status headline and resolved status, baseline diff (failures pre vs post), files created/modified with line counts, test results and coverage, commits made, API endpoints implemented, known issues, ready for review checklist.

### Step 7: Update Tracking

Update `status.json` backend phase. **Status transition is gated on the Step 4.2 status:**

| Step 4.2 status | `phases.be.status` |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| `PASS` | `ready_for_review` |
| `BLOCKED` (with explicit operator acceptance + recorded rationale) | `ready_for_review` |
| `BLOCKED` (no acceptance) | `in_progress` (blocked rationale recorded) |
| `UNVERIFIED` | `in_progress` |
| `NO_INFRA` | `in_progress` |
| `RUNNER_BROKEN` | `in_progress` |
| `REGRESSION` | `in_progress` (return to Step 4) |

```json
{
  "phases": {
    "be": {
      "status": "ready_for_review",
      "completed": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
    }
  }
}
```

For non-PASS / non-accepted-BLOCKED outcomes, also write `phases.be.failure_reason` with the verbatim `Status:` value and a one-line summary.

Append to `changelog.md`:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] DEV-BE: UC### - Task Title
- Phase: Backend Development
- Status: [DEV-BE COMPLETE | DEV-BE APPLIED — UNVERIFIED | DEV-BE APPLIED — BLOCKED | DEV-BE APPLIED — NO_INFRA | DEV-BE APPLIED — RUNNER_BROKEN | DEV-BE INCOMPLETE — REGRESSION]
- Changes: N files, +X/-Y lines
- Tests: N passed, coverage X%
- Endpoints: POST /api/xxx, GET /api/xxx
```

## --continue Flag: Fix Review Issues

When invoked as `/nacl:tl-dev-be UC### --continue`, the agent fixes issues from a prior review by **delegating to `/nacl:tl-fix`**. This skill no longer runs an inline test-after-change loop. The TDD/baseline/RED-first contract lives in `nacl-tl-fix`; this skill is a thin wrapper that builds the problem description, invokes the fix sub-agent, and propagates the resulting six-status into `result-be.md` and `status.json`.

**Why delegation:** the previous "fix the issue, run tests" inline loop was test-after-change with no required RED-first test, no captured baseline, and no failure-set comparison — the same dishonesty class that triggered the 0.10.0 regression. `/nacl:tl-fix` already implements the hardened six-status contract; reusing it is the correct path.

### --continue Pre-Checks

1. **Review file exists**: `.tl/tasks/UC###/review-be.md`
2. **Review has issues**: At least one Blocker, Critical, or Major issue
3. **Status is correct**: `phases.be.status` is "rejected" or "in_progress"

If `review-be.md` does not exist:

```
Error: No backend review found for UC###

Expected: .tl/tasks/UC###/review-be.md

Run: /nacl:tl-review UC### --be to perform backend review first.
```

### --continue Workflow (Delegation to `/nacl:tl-fix`)

```
1. Read .tl/tasks/UC###/review-be.md.
2. Parse issues by severity (Blocker / Critical / Major).
   Drop Minor issues for the delegated invocation; they are captured in the
   final result-be.md note section.
3. Render each issue as a problem-description block:
     File: <path>:<line>
     Severity: <Blocker | Critical | Major>
     Description: <text>
     Suggestion: <text>
   Concatenate the blocks into a single problem-description string in
   priority order (Blocker → Critical → Major).
4. Invoke /nacl:tl-fix as a sub-agent:
     /nacl:tl-fix "<problem description>" --uc UC### --from-review
   The fix sub-agent owns:
     - runner discovery (its Step 7.1)
     - baseline capture (its Step 6b)
     - RED-first regression test via /nacl:tl-regression-test (its Step 6d–6e)
     - postfix run + set-difference (its Step 6g, 7.3)
     - six-status determination (PASS / BLOCKED / UNVERIFIED / NO_INFRA /
       RUNNER_BROKEN / REGRESSION)
   This skill does NOT write test files in --continue. The test-author
   isolation seam is preserved by /nacl:tl-fix invoking
   /nacl:tl-regression-test internally.
5. Read /nacl:tl-fix's report. Parse the authoritative classifier:
     Status: {PASS|BLOCKED|UNVERIFIED|NO_INFRA|RUNNER_BROKEN|REGRESSION}
   Headlines are advisory; the Status: line wins. A report without a
   parseable Status: line halts this skill as
   "DEV-BE APPLIED — UNVERIFIED (downstream report unparseable)".
6. Read the fix report's regression-test seam evidence:
     - Tests > Regression test:  <test file path>
     - Tests > RED→GREEN:        <transition evidence>
   If the seam evidence is missing for a non-NO_INFRA / non-RUNNER_BROKEN
   status, treat the outcome as UNVERIFIED.
7. Append a "## Fix Iteration N" block to .tl/tasks/UC###/result-be.md:

     ## Fix Iteration N — <ISO timestamp>
     Source: review-be.md (Blocker: A, Critical: B, Major: C)
     Delegated to: /nacl:tl-fix --uc UC### --from-review
     Fix Status: <Status: line value, verbatim from nacl-tl-fix report>
     Fix Headline: <header line from nacl-tl-fix report>
     Regression-test seam:
       - test file: <path or "n/a (NO_INFRA / RUNNER_BROKEN)">
       - RED→GREEN: <evidence string from fix report>
     Issues addressed:
       1. [Blocker] <title> @ <file:line> — <one-line outcome>
       2. [Critical] <title> @ <file:line> — <one-line outcome>
       ...
     Issues NOT addressed (Minor, deferred):
       - [Minor] <title> @ <file:line>

8. Update status.json phases.be:
     - Status: PASS                        → phases.be.status = "ready_for_review"
     - Status: BLOCKED + operator accept   → phases.be.status = "ready_for_review"
                                             (record acceptance reason in
                                             phases.be.blocked_accept_reason)
     - Status: BLOCKED (no acceptance)     → phases.be.status = "in_progress"
     - Status: UNVERIFIED                  → phases.be.status = "in_progress"
     - Status: NO_INFRA                    → phases.be.status = "in_progress"
     - Status: RUNNER_BROKEN               → phases.be.status = "in_progress"
     - Status: REGRESSION                  → phases.be.status = "in_progress"
   For all non-PASS / non-accepted-BLOCKED outcomes, write:
     phases.be.continue_failure_reason = "<Status: value> — <one-line>"

9. Do NOT auto-commit on non-PASS. /nacl:tl-fix already commits its
   own fix on PASS / accepted-BLOCKED (per its Step 6 commit gate); for
   any other status, surface the result to the operator and stop.
```

### --continue Issue Parsing

Extract issues from `review-be.md`:

```markdown
### Issue 1: [Severity] Title
**File:** src/path/to/file.ts:42
**Description:** What is wrong
**Suggestion:** How to fix
```

Fix priorities: Blockers first, then Critical, then Major. Minor issues are recorded but NOT included in the delegated `/nacl:tl-fix` problem description (the operator can re-run with a follow-up review iteration if Minors must be addressed in this UC).

### --continue: silence-as-evidence is forbidden

If the fix sub-agent's report does not contain a Status: line, or omits the regression-test seam (`Tests > Regression test`, `Tests > RED→GREEN`) for a status that requires it (anything other than NO_INFRA or RUNNER_BROKEN), this skill does NOT promote `phases.be` to `ready_for_review`. Silence is `UNVERIFIED`; require explicit evidence to advance. This mirrors the rule already enforced in `nacl-tl-dev-fe` Step 3.3.

## Test Naming & Coverage

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Unit | `*.test.ts` | `order.service.test.ts` |
| Integration | `*.integration.test.ts` | `order.integration.test.ts` |
| E2E | `*.e2e.test.ts` | `order.e2e.test.ts` |

Coverage thresholds: Statements 80%+ (target 90%), Branches 75%+ (target 85%), Functions 80%+ (target 90%), Lines 80%+ (target 90%).

## Status Values for phases.be

```
pending → in_progress → ready_for_review → approved → done
                ↑                              |
                +--------- in_progress ←── rejected
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Backend task created, not started |
| `in_progress` | Backend development in progress |
| `ready_for_review` | Backend TDD cycle complete |
| `in_review` | Backend code review in progress |
| `rejected` | Review failed, needs rework (use --continue) |
| `approved` | Backend review passed |
| `done` | Backend documentation complete |

## Reference Documents

Load these for detailed guidelines:

| Task | Reference |
|------|-----------|
| TDD workflow | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/nacl-tl-core/references/tdd-workflow.md` |
| Task file format | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/nacl-tl-core/references/task-file-format.md` |
| Code style | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/nacl-tl-core/references/code-style.md` |
| API contract rules | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/nacl-tl-core/references/api-contract-rules.md` |
| Commit conventions | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/nacl-tl-core/references/commit-conventions.md` |

## Templates

Use template from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/nacl-tl-core/templates/` for output:

- `result-template.md` - Development result template (create as `result-be.md`)

## Error Handling

### Task Not Found

```
Error: Task UC### backend files not found

Expected structure:
  .tl/tasks/UC###/
  ├── task-be.md
  ├── test-spec.md
  ├── impl-brief.md
  └── acceptance.md

Run: /nacl:tl-plan to create development plan first.
```

### Task Blocked

Report blockers and exit. User must resolve blockers before development.

### Tests Fail During GREEN

Continue iterating on implementation. Do NOT skip to refactoring. Document the issue if stuck.

### Dependency Not Ready

Report unresolved dependencies with their statuses. User must complete dependent tasks first.

### API Contract Missing

Warn but proceed using `impl-brief.md` as reference. Suggest running `/nacl:tl-plan` to generate contracts.

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

### TDD Phase Anti-patterns

| Phase | Pattern | Problem | Correct |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| RED | Testing implementation | Brittle tests | Test behavior |
| RED | Too many assertions | Unclear failures | One concept per test |
| RED | No failure verification | False positives | Step 3.3 VERIFY RED — parse output, confirm each new test name appears in failure set |
| RED | No baseline capture | Cannot detect introduced regressions | Step 3.1 CAPTURE BASELINE — run suite before writing any test |
| RED | Mocking everything | Tests prove nothing | Mock only external deps |
| GREEN | Over-engineering | Wasted effort | Minimal code |
| GREEN | Skip to refactor | Unstable base | Make it work first |
| GREEN | Adding features | Scope creep | Only what tests need |
| GREEN | Ignoring api-contract | Contract mismatch | Follow contract exactly |
| GREEN | No postfix comparison | Cannot claim GREEN honestly | Step 4.2 VERIFY GREEN + COMPARE — compute delta against baseline |
| REFACTOR | Big-bang refactoring | Risk of breakage | Small steps |
| REFACTOR | No test run | Broken code | Test after each change |
| REFACTOR | Adding features | Scope creep | Only improve existing |
| REFACTOR | Changing API shape | Contract violation | Keep API contract stable |

### Backend-Specific Anti-patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Correct |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Implementing frontend code | Wrong scope | That is nacl-tl-dev-fe's job |
| Modifying api-contract.md | Breaks contract flow | That is nacl-tl-plan's or nacl-tl-sync's job |
| Creating mock React components | Wrong scope | Backend only |
| Hardcoding URLs or ports | Not portable | Use config/env variables |
| Using `any` in TypeScript | No type safety | Use proper types from shared/ |
| Skipping input validation | Security risk | Validate with Zod schemas |
| No error codes | FE cannot handle errors | Use standardized error codes |
| SQL in controllers | Mixed concerns | Use repository pattern |
| Business logic in controllers | Mixed concerns | Use service pattern |

Files:
  Created: N files (+XXX lines)
  Modified: N files (+XX/-YY lines)

Tests:
  Runner:           [exact test command actually run, or "none — NO_INFRA"]
  Baseline:         [N tests collected, K failing] or "skipped (RUNNER_BROKEN)"
  Regression test:  [repo-relative path of test written by /nacl:tl-regression-test
                     mode=feature-dev | "none — UNVERIFIED" | "n/a — NO_INFRA"]
  RED verified:     [yes — new tests appeared in failure set] or [no — HALT, see Step 3.3]
  Postfix:          [N tests collected, K failing] or "skipped"
  Baseline diff:    [list of transitions, or "none — UNVERIFIED", or "pre-existing: [list] — BLOCKED"]
  New failures:     [list — only if REGRESSION; otherwise "none"]
  Coverage:         XX%

The `Regression test:` line is **mandatory** when Status ∈ {PASS, UNVERIFIED, BLOCKED}. Orchestrators (`nacl-tl-conductor`, `nacl-tl-full`) parse it verbatim and forward it into `Task.verification_evidence` in the graph (see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/nacl-core/SKILL.md` § Task.verification_evidence). The path must be repo-relative.

Endpoints Implemented:

Commits: 3
  - test(UC###): add failing backend tests
  - feat(UC###): implement backend feature
  - refactor(UC###): improve backend implementation

Next step:
  DEV-BE COMPLETE       → /nacl:tl-review UC### --be to start review
  DEV-BE APPLIED — *    → See status rationale above; resolve before review
  DEV-BE INCOMPLETE     → Return to Step 4; do NOT submit for review
```

### --continue Output Summary

The headline is status-aware and matches the same six-status vocabulary used by `nacl-tl-fix`. The `Status:` line below the headline is the authoritative classifier; the headline is decoration.

  BLOCKED (accepted)    → /nacl:tl-review UC### --be (re-review with note)
  BLOCKED (rejected)    → return to Step 4 / re-invoke --continue with sharper inputs
  UNVERIFIED            → re-invoke --continue OR run /nacl:tl-regression-test retroactively
  NO_INFRA              → /nacl:tl-dev TECH-### "set up BE test runner"
  RUNNER_BROKEN         → /nacl:tl-diagnose; do NOT advance the phase
  REGRESSION            → return to Step 4f in /nacl:tl-fix; do NOT submit for review
```

This skill never writes test files in `--continue`; the fix sub-agent owns that responsibility via its `nacl-tl-regression-test` invocation.

## Development Checklist

**Before Starting:** Task files exist (task-be.md, test-spec.md, impl-brief.md), api-contract.md present, phase status pending/in_progress, no blockers, dependencies resolved.

**RED Phase:**
- [ ] Step 3.0 — DISCOVER RUNNER: test command resolved (config.yaml test_cmd, or ecosystem-native discovery)
- [ ] Step 3.1 — CAPTURE BASELINE: suite run before writing any test; baseline.txt stored
- [ ] Step 3.2 — All test cases from test-spec.md written
- [ ] Step 3.3 — VERIFY RED: new tests appear in failure set; no previously-passing test flipped
- [ ] Step 3.3 — Committed with `test(UC###):` prefix

**GREEN Phase:**
- [ ] Controllers implement api-contract endpoints
- [ ] Services have business logic
- [ ] Repos handle data access
- [ ] DTOs validate with Zod
- [ ] Step 4.2 — VERIFY GREEN + COMPARE: delta computed against baseline; status determined
- [ ] All tests pass (PASS or BLOCKED with rationale)
- [ ] Committed with `feat(UC###):` prefix

**REFACTOR Phase:** Code quality improved, tests still pass, error handling complete, TypeScript strict, committed with `refactor(UC###):` prefix.

**After Completion:** result-be.md created (includes status headline and baseline diff), status.json phases.be set to ready_for_review, changelog.md updated with status headline.

## Next Steps

After backend development:

- `/nacl:tl-review UC### --be` - Start backend code review
- `/nacl:tl-dev-fe UC###` - Start frontend development (if api-contract ready)
- `/nacl:tl-status` - View project progress
- `/nacl:tl-next` - Get next suggested task
