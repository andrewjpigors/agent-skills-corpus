## Codex Profile Freshness Gate

On every entry or resume into this skill, before any role probe, retry, re-plan,
or real dispatch, run the normal preflight gate, not `--doctor`. Resolve exactly
one enabled installed Kaola edition from `codex plugin list --json`, then execute
the bundled `kaola-workflow-codex-preflight.js` from that edition's exact
marketplace/name/version cache tuple.
Never search `$PWD/plugins` or select the lexically first cache entry:

```bash
if ! KAOLA_CODEX_PLUGIN_LIST_OUT="$(codex plugin list --json 2>&1)"; then
  printf 'profile_preflight_refused: plugin metadata unavailable: %s\n' "$KAOLA_CODEX_PLUGIN_LIST_OUT" >&2

const rows=(Array.isArray(value.installed)?value.installed:[]).filter(row => row && row.installed === true && row.enabled === true && allowed.has(row.name));
if(rows.length!==1)throw new Error(`expected exactly one enabled installed Kaola edition; got ${rows.length}`);
const row=rows[0];

if(row.pluginId!==`${row.name}@${row.marketplaceName}`)throw new Error("plugin identity mismatch");
process.stdout.write([row.marketplaceName,row.name,row.version].join("\t"));

  printf 'profile_preflight_refused: %s\n' "$KAOLA_CODEX_PREFLIGHT_OUT" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

The exact active cache root is
`$HOME/.codex/plugins/cache/$KAOLA_CODEX_MARKETPLACE/$KAOLA_CODEX_PLUGIN_NAME/$KAOLA_CODEX_PLUGIN_VERSION`.
The base invocation is `--project-root "$PWD" --no-autofix --json`; the gate
merges persisted config from HOME through the repository root to `"$PWD"`. When this
skill owns a frozen adaptive plan, set `KAOLA_CODEX_PREFLIGHT_PLAN` to that
exact plan before running the block so `--plan` is also enforced. Continue only
after exit 0 and parsed `status: "ok"`. Exact-byte drift such as
`profile_bytes_mismatch` is `profile_preflight_refused`: STOP before any
`agents.spawn_agent` call, never record `subagent-invoked`, and do not relabel
profile/config drift as tool unavailability or local fallback. Re-run the gate if the installed profile set changes.
<!-- /PIN -->

# Skill: kaola-workflow-plan-run (GitLab)

Adaptive executor. Runs a frozen `workflow-plan.md` (`workflow_path: adaptive`) by
traversing its DAG + `## Node Ledger` instead of the fixed phaseN ladder. Reads and
updates `kaola-workflow/{project}/workflow-state.md` throughout. The plan is guarded by
`plan_hash`; tampering is a **typed refusal**. Drive every node to `complete` or `n/a`,
honoring the computed gates, then route to `kaola-workflow-finalize`.

Run subcommands with `--summary` for one-line output. For an opening call (`open-next` /
`open-ready` / `close-and-open-next`), the summary line already carries the dispatch
essentials: `summary: ok | opened=<node-id> role=<role> task=<codex_task_name>
mode=<codex_dispatch_mode> effort=<medium|xhigh|unresolved>` (one `opened=` segment per member on a
batch open; `effort=unresolved` is a typed `codex_tier_unresolved` refusal, never inheritance; the leg path is NOT in the
summary line). The full envelope — every field, including `dispatch.leg_path` and the
complete `dispatch:{...}` object — needs `--json` without `--summary`, or the cached
`.cache/<op>-envelope.json`. Drill into the full envelope on `result: refuse` (includes
`operator_hint`), AND — whenever running with `--summary` — before every dispatch: take the
dispatch card from the summary line's `opened=` segment or from `.cache/<op>-envelope.json`.
Never dispatch without the card in view.

## In-progress re-plan control plane

<!-- PIN: replan-plan-run -->

This fence outranks every normal startup, mirror, scheduler, handoff, validation, and
finalization route. Before any such action, read the project state and transaction status. When
either reports `replan_in_progress`, do not mutate or replace the frozen parent
`workflow-plan.md`. Read-only orientation must report the exact `replan_phase`,
`transaction_id`, `parent_plan_hash`, `child_plan_hash` (or `none`), and
`last_cas_result`; never reconstruct them from memory.

The single legal mutation while the fence is active is the edition-local re-plan resume command:

```bash
REPLAN_SCRIPT="./plugins/kaola-workflow-gitlab/scripts/kaola-gitlab-workflow-replan.js"
if [ ! -f "$REPLAN_SCRIPT" ]; then
  REPLAN_SCRIPT="$(find "$HOME/.codex/plugins/cache" -path '*/kaola-workflow-gitlab/*/scripts/kaola-gitlab-workflow-replan.js' -print -quit 2>/dev/null)"
fi
[ -n "$REPLAN_SCRIPT" ] && [ -f "$REPLAN_SCRIPT" ] || { echo "BLOCKED: kaola-gitlab-workflow-replan.js unavailable" >&2; exit 1; }
node "$REPLAN_SCRIPT" resume --project {project} --json
```

The installed aggregator is `kaola-gitlab-workflow-replan.js`. Do not run mirror/open/record/close/run-chains,
ordinary adaptive handoff, claim archive, task-mirror refresh, or finalize while an intermediate
phase remains. `decision:ask` remains advisory and never adds a pause or gate.

If resume returns `replan_planner_dispatch_required`, dispatch the genuine
`workflow-planner` profile in its Re-plan dispatch mode with an isolated brief containing only
the repository root, project, `transaction_id`, `dispatch_nonce`, profile identity, the exact
`.cache/replan-planner-packet.json` path, and the packet's reason/source evidence. No role
sequence, node ids, dependencies, write sets, cardinality, shape, model, or exact DAG fragment may
be supplied by the orchestrator; an attempt earns `planner_control_boundary_violation`. The
planner alone writes the seeded `workflow-plan.next.md` and
`.cache/replan-planner-attestation.json`, then returns through this same resume command. Missing,
stale, replayed, or mismatched dispatch proof/attestation is
`replan_planner_attestation_invalid`; main must never synthesize either artifact.

An invalid unfrozen child uses the bounded unfrozen child-repair loop: re-dispatch the same planner
with the verbatim validator errors and its own child draft, then resume. The main session never
repairs the child DAG. At the retry bound, stop with the typed evidence; do not create a competing
plan, restart the claim, or route to another path. A verified legacy-v1 parent follows this same
transaction into a schema-2 child; legacy normal startup behavior otherwise stays unchanged.

## Setup

Resolve the worktree path and `$KAOLA_SCRIPTS` before the first node call:

```bash
ACTIVE_WORKTREE_PATH="$(node -e "try{const fs=require('fs');const s=fs.readFileSync('kaola-workflow/' + process.env.KAOLA_PROJECT + '/workflow-state.md','utf8');const m=s.match(/^worktree_path:\\s*(.+)$/m);process.stdout.write(m?m[1].trim():'');}catch(e){}" 2>/dev/null)" || true
[ -z "$ACTIVE_WORKTREE_PATH" ] && ACTIVE_WORKTREE_PATH="$(pwd)"
KAOLA_SCRIPTS="plugins/kaola-workflow-gitlab/scripts"
if [ ! -f "$KAOLA_SCRIPTS/kaola-gitlab-workflow-adaptive-node.js" ]; then
  KAOLA_SCRIPTS="$(dirname "$(find "$HOME/.codex/plugins/cache" -path '*/kaola-workflow-gitlab/*/scripts/kaola-gitlab-workflow-adaptive-node.js' -print -quit 2>/dev/null)")"
fi
```

**Resolve the scripts path per command, not once.** The Bash tool does NOT persist
environment variables between calls (true for Claude Code AND opencode) — a `$KAOLA_SCRIPTS` set
in one Bash call is GONE in the next, so a later lifecycle call crashes with `Cannot find module
'/…-adaptive-node.js'`. Re-resolve the absolute scripts path in EVERY Bash call that needs it:
either repeat the resolver block above (or an equivalent absolute-path lookup) at the top of each
call, or hardcode the absolute path — never rely on a once-set `$KAOLA_SCRIPTS` carrying into a
subsequent call.

Then mirror the project folder into the worktree (idempotent, `plan_hash`-verified):

```bash
node "$KAOLA_SCRIPTS/kaola-gitlab-workflow-adaptive-node.js" mirror-project \
  --project {project} --json
```

`status: mirrored | exists | skipped` → proceed. `result: refuse` → STOP and surface verbatim.

Then **enter the worktree** — every adaptive lifecycle call below runs from the worktree cwd:

```bash
[ -n "$ACTIVE_WORKTREE_PATH" ] && [ "$ACTIVE_WORKTREE_PATH" != "$(pwd)" ] && cd "$ACTIVE_WORKTREE_PATH"
```

**Worktree-cwd contract:** the mutating lifecycle subcommands (`open-next` / `open-ready` /
`record-evidence --stdin` / `close-and-open-next` / `close-node` / `reconcile-running-set` /
`write-halt` / `clear-halt` / `reopen-node` / `revert-overflow` / `repair-node` / `route-findings`)
resolve the project folder — `workflow-plan.md`, the `## Node Ledger`, `.cache/{node-id}.md` evidence,
and the barrier baselines — **cwd-relative**. Run them ALL from the worktree so durable state lands
where the role agents write. Running one from the main repo root while a worktree is linked refuses
with `worktree_authority_split` (zero mutation) — `cd "$ACTIVE_WORKTREE_PATH"` and re-run. (`orient`
and `record-evidence --verify` are read-only and exempt; `mirror-project` is the main→worktree copy
and must run from the main root, above.)

## Dispatch

<!-- PIN: codex-dispatch -->
Model, reasoning effort, and identity: always delegate to the base `dispatch.agent_type` profile (= the
node's role). Every named profile omits both runtime-strength keys and therefore inherits the current
parent session. The descriptor's `dispatch.codex_profile_mode` is `inherit`; its
`dispatch.codex_profile_tier` remains declarative role metadata, and its
`dispatch.codex_model` + `dispatch.codex_reasoning_effort` fields come only from a fresh parent-session
proof. An unresolved tier refuses as `codex_tier_unresolved`; inheritance never creates a tier/profile
compatibility conflict.

Before the first real node for the current parent session and installed profile-set fingerprint,
require one fresh parent-equals-child inheritance proof. Spawn the probe by role identity only, bind it
to the intended installed profile path and role, then inspect both parent and child session JSONL latest
`turn_context` model and effort. Config text, spawn arguments, and parent-side descriptors are not proof.
If the profile-set binding changes, either value is absent/stale, the child identity/path is wrong, or
the child pair differs from the freshly re-read parent pair, refuse with
`codex_profile_runtime_mismatch`. A parent-side encrypted
output/decryption failure does not erase valid JSONL profile evidence. For real node work it is a
separate transport failure handled only by the durable-result contract below: verified child-written
cache evidence may continue as `returned_partial`; missing or invalid cache evidence cannot.

Codex collaboration transport is a hard pre-dispatch gate. In v2 task-name mode, invoke every
collaboration operation through the direct `agents` namespace reported by preflight. Never use the
server-reserved `collaboration` namespace and never dispatch through `functions.exec` or Code Mode. If preflight reports
`codex_v2_encrypted_transport_unsafe` or `codex_v2_role_transport_unsafe`, refuse before spawning.
Do not retry an encrypted-output decode or reserved-schema failure and do not fall back to a default
role: the same transport/schema mismatch is deterministic.

For Codex v2 task-name mode (`dispatch.codex_dispatch_mode: "v2-task-name"`), after the proof gate
passes, call the direct `agents.spawn_agent` tool with `task_name: dispatch.codex_task_name`, `agent_type:
dispatch.agent_type`, and `fork_turns: "none"` on EVERY role dispatch — the dispatch card
is self-contained by contract, so no role spawn ever forks the parent's history. Omit both `model`
and `reasoning_effort`; the named standalone profile owns the pair. For v1 fallback
(`"v1-thread-id"`), omit `task_name`, keep
`agent_type: dispatch.agent_type` and `fork_turns: "none"` — the unconditional mandate applies
identically to this dispatch mode — again omit `model` and `reasoning_effort`, and prefix the prompt with
`Node: <id> | Role: <role> | Expected model: <dispatch.codex_model> | Expected effort: <dispatch.codex_reasoning_effort> | Profile mode: <dispatch.codex_profile_mode>`. Pass
`Working directory: ${ACTIVE_WORKTREE_PATH}` to every role delegation.

## Codex Join Protocol

<!-- PIN: join-protocol -->
Spawning a frontier is only half the delegation lifecycle — this protocol governs everything after
`spawn_agent` returns: how long to wait, when (and how) to nudge a slow agent, and how to reclaim a
node safely if it truly stalls. No timeout or patience value here is left to model improvisation —
every number traces to the dispatch card (`dispatch.wait_budget_minutes`) or a named config bound.
Detailed mechanics: `docs/plan-run-cards/join-protocol.md`.

**A. Wait budget.** Every dispatch card carries `dispatch.wait_budget_minutes` — tier-derived (e.g.
40 minutes for a reasoning-tier node, 20 for standard; an unresolved tier still resolves to a
concrete role-default, never null). **A `running` agent is NEVER interrupted before its wait
budget expires.** Read the budget off the card at dispatch time; never substitute an improvised
patience ceiling.

**B. Long-poll join loop — one wait per iteration, drain every completed member, no status
probes.** After dispatching a frontier, loop: call `wait_agent` ONCE per iteration with a LONG
timeout (minutes — at or near the host's `max_wait_timeout_ms`), passing every outstanding agent id
where the tool supports multi-id wait. On wake, call `list_agents` ONCE, then drain EVERY completed
member before re-waiting — integrate its result, `record-evidence`, `close-node`, and, where the
tool surface exposes it, `close_agent` (best-effort hygiene: some sessions never expose it and the
harness auto-reaps completed agents, so its absence is not an error). `send_message` status-probe
requests to a still-running agent are PROHIBITED as a liveness check — a busy agent answers at its
own turn boundary, not on demand, and a probe is structurally unanswerable evidence of nothing.

**C. Escalation ladder — replaces impatience-kill.** Applied ONLY after the wait budget (A) has
expired, each rung gated on the previous:
1. Budget expired → send a `followup_task` demanding the bounded deliverable now (evidence +
   changed-file list); this reaches a running agent at its next message boundary.
2. Grace window (~5 minutes) passes with no response → `interrupt_agent`, then a further
   `followup_task` asking the still-available agent for partial evidence and its changed-file list.
3. Only then: reclaim the node. Inline redo by the orchestrator is the documented LAST resort.

Record a typed `delegation_outcome` in the node's evidence for every delegation: `completed |
returned_partial | interrupted_unresponsive | interrupted_obsolete` — never a free-text "it
stalled so I did it myself".

**Writer kill-safety.** An in-place writer (shared worktree) is non-interruptible before the wait
budget and the full escalation ladder above — no exception. A writer that must be interruptible
belongs in an isolated `parallel_safe` leg instead (the existing per-leg mechanism); interrupting an
isolated-leg writer discards the leg atomically, never partially. After reclaiming ANY writer
(ladder step 2 or the reclaim itself), run `reconcile-running-set` and HONOR its verdict before
re-opening the node: a `writerHalt: true` result means at least one departing writer's changes
could not be positively confirmed inside its declared write set — do NOT re-open that node until the
out-of-set paths are resolved (`revert-overflow`, `repair-node`, or a consent halt). Re-opening on a
`halt` verdict without resolving it first is the exact halt-then-reopen laundering hole this
protocol closes.

**F. Frontier dispatch discipline + slot awareness.** On `enterBatch: true`, issue every
`spawn_agent` call for the frontier back-to-back in ONE turn, then run exactly ONE join loop (B) for
the whole frontier — never one spawn-then-wait cycle per member. Width counts only RUNNING members:
a finished-but-unclosed agent does not hold a concurrency seat, so do not subtract it from available
width. On a spawn refusal (a thread-limit / concurrency-limit error), wait for or close a finished
agent, then retry the SAME spawn ONCE — this reactive fallback is the capacity remedy, never
proactive closure.


<!-- PIN: planner-wait-budget -->
The dispatch card's frozen `wait_budget_minutes` value and source are authoritative. A
`planner_override` may extend but never shorten the existing no-interrupt floor. The join loop must
not interrupt or re-nudge before that floor expires; after it expires, the bounded escalation still
requires a complete governed deliverable. This planner-authored floor is distinct from
`optimize_budget`: only a metric-optimizer contract supplies the specialized optimization wall-clock
source described by the metric-optimizer card.

## Gate-Role Degradation Notice

The Codex Profile Freshness Gate above is authoritative for profile/config availability. Missing,
stale, malformed, or shadowed project profiles are `profile_preflight_refused`: STOP before opening
the first node; never route that drift through this degradation path. After a successful gate,
determine runtime dispatch-tool availability before opening the first node and re-check if it changes
mid-run. Only a genuinely unavailable agent tool or a runtime mode-refused spawn qualifies. When
that dispatch capability is unavailable, post a PROMINENT run-start notice — before dispatching any
node — naming every gate role the plan would otherwise have dispatched: `adversarial-verifier`,
`code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`.

For `adversarial-verifier` and `code-reviewer`, an inline gate reviewing its own writer-context is
no gate: do NOT dispatch the gate node inline and silently record a self-issued `verdict: pass`.
Instead route through the consent-halt valve (`write-halt --reason consent`) and await operator
resolution before the gate node is considered satisfied. Forward roles — `code-explorer`,
`knowledge-lookup`, `implementer`, `tdd-guide`, `metric-optimizer`, `doc-updater`, and
`security-reviewer` when it runs as a forward check — may still record the documented local fallback
(`local-fallback-tool-unavailable`) and proceed inline.

When a node runs inline under this degradation notice, announce it instead of the pre-spawn
format above:

```text
→ running {node_id} · {role} inline (…reason token…)
```

## Loop Skeleton

### 1. Orient (on entry / resume)

```bash
node "$KAOLA_SCRIPTS/kaola-gitlab-workflow-adaptive-node.js" orient \
  --project {project} --json --summary
```

`orient` is read-only: re-checks `plan_hash`, the ready set from `next-action`, any `in_progress`
node and its `.cache/{node-id}.md` state, `escalated_to_full` / `consent_halt: pending` markers,
and the `allDone` flag. Makes NO mutations.

On resume or after a context compaction, the in-progress node's re-dispatch context
(`goal_line` + `upstream_evidence`) is re-derived from the cached `.cache/<op>-envelope.json` —
the disk is authoritative; never reconstruct it from memory.

<!-- CARD: resume -->
On crash/interrupt resume, read the card: `docs/plan-run-cards/resume.md`
(covers `requires_redispatch`, complete-evidence crash, consent-halt `clear-halt`, unfrozen plan)

<!-- CARD: governance -->
On `plan_not_frozen` / governance: `docs/plan-run-cards/governance.md`
(covers `decision:auto-run`/`decision:ask` audit metadata; `provisional` run authorization;
`auto-run` vs `ask` — a frozen in-grammar plan RUNS either way; `typed refusal` on out-of-grammar)

Announce the run once, right after this orient succeeds and before opening the first node:

```text
plan-run orchestrator: driving {project} — {N} nodes; each role subagent will be announced at dispatch.
```

Substitute `{project}` for the project name and `{N}` for the total row count of `## Nodes`.

### 2. Open next node

```bash
node "$KAOLA_SCRIPTS/kaola-gitlab-workflow-adaptive-node.js" open-next \
  --project {project} --json --summary
```

Under `--summary` (the canonical invocation above), the printed line is `summary: ok |
opened=<node-id> role=<role> task=<codex_task_name> mode=<codex_dispatch_mode>
effort=<medium|xhigh|unresolved>` or `summary: ok | allDone: true` — refuse an unresolved tier;
otherwise read the dispatch card straight
off the `opened=` segment. The full envelope needs `--json` without `--summary` (or the
cached `.cache/open-next-envelope.json`): `{opened:{id,role,model,declared_write_set}, nonce,
evidence_file, required_tokens, dispatch:{...}}` or `{allDone:true}`. On `allDone`, run chains
then route to finalize.

The fused `close-and-open-next` (step 4) opens every subsequent node. Re-run `open-next` only
when no node is `in_progress`.

### 3. Dispatch the role agent

**Every spawn parameter comes from the dispatch card.** NEVER improvise a task name, omit
`agent_type`, or drop the effort tier because the card was not in view — go get the card
first (the summary line's `opened=` segment, or `.cache/<op>-envelope.json`).

<!-- PIN: reviewer-contract-v2-execution -->
#### Reviewer Contract Envelope, Validation, and Convergence

Resolve the frozen plan contract before dispatch. A verified already-frozen plan whose
hash-covered Meta predates the version field is the explicit legacy branch:
`plan_schema_version: 1` and `contract_version: 1`. Preserve its existing token registry,
`verdict`/`findings_blocking` evidence, and schema-1 journal byte-for-byte; never manufacture a
schema-2 context or rewrite legacy state. Any new/mismatched/unknown version is a typed refusal.

For a schema-2 review gate, the opener's dispatch card is the sole runtime envelope. Pass every
field unchanged: `plan_schema_version`, `contract_version`, `behavior_contract_version`,
`behavior_contract_hash`, `resolved_profile_hash`, `review_context_hash`, `review_context_path`,
`candidate_digest`, graph-derived `gate_mode`, `logical_gate`, `gate_claim`, `gate_surface`, and
`gate_aggregation`. Never infer a second mode, assemble a context from prose, substitute a local
profile, or omit a field. The role reads the canonical file at `review_context_path` before it
examines findings and echoes the card's required identity tokens; `execution_status` and
`gate_effect` remain harness-owned.

Before settling that gate, read the context's `validation_obligations`. For every inherited
obligation, run the frozen schema-2 validation policy through the validation runner and persist its
canonical receipt under `.cache/validation-vectors/`. Accept it only when the machine comparison
finds the exact obligated command/vector identity, the current `candidate_digest`, and outcome
`pass`; missing, drifted, failed, inconclusive, timed-out, signaled, or candidate-mutating execution
leaves the gate open and routes validation repair. Never relabel an execution failure as an
analytical `indeterminate` outcome.

Resolve `kaola-workflow-validation-runner.js` from the same installed runtime as the adaptive node; pass the exact hash-covered policy values and write one canonical JSON receipt per obligation without shell re-derivation.

Honor close-time convergence outcomes structurally. `review_failed` follows the authoritative
journal and existing agent-owned writer selection. `replan_required` with
`review_scope_expanded` or `review_nonconvergent` is a settled durable handoff: surface the exact
packet and stop this frozen run without calling `repair-node`, thawing the plan, activating another
epoch, or choosing topology. The harness never selects a writer or replacement DAG.
<!-- /PIN -->

Immediately before every spawn, announce the dispatch:

```text
→ dispatching {node_id} · {role} as subagent task "{task_name}" (model {model}, effort {effort})
```

`{task_name}` is `dispatch.codex_task_name` on Codex, the agent name/description on Claude, the
child task label on opencode. `{effort}` is the dispatch-card effort on Codex and `n/a` on a
runtime without an effort surface; it never means parent/session inheritance.

Delegate to the base role profile matching `dispatch.agent_type`. Apply the task-name and
reasoning-effort rule above. Pass `dispatch.nonce` (evidence-binding token). Instruct the role to:
- Read the seeded `.cache/{node-id}.md` (`dispatch.evidence_file`) for required tokens.
<!-- PIN: node-briefs-relay -->
- When `dispatch.goal_line` is present, carry it VERBATIM into the role dispatch as the node's
  task direction.
- When `dispatch.upstream_evidence` is present, instruct the role to READ each listed evidence
  file BEFORE starting work and record a column-0 `upstream_read: <node-id> <nonce>` line in its
  own evidence, copying the nonce from line 1 of that upstream file (never from the card — the
  card never carries it).
- Fill in token stubs; NEVER modify the `evidence-binding:` header line.
- `finalize` sink and `main-session-gate` are non-delegable — run `main-session-direct`.
  Record compliance as `main-session-direct` for the `finalize` sink node.
- Gate roles must `post-dominate` every code/sensitive node in the `## Node Ledger`; emit
  `verdict: pass|fail` + `findings_blocking: N`. Run `--forbidden-only` for forge-touching
  nodes. Forge-port mirror nodes: instruct with the `full accumulated root diff` diff spec.
- For read-only fan-out (`quorum`/`tally-fn`/`validateNodeOutput`): dispatch concurrently,
  persist and verify evidence by the runtime contract below, `close-node` per member.
- `FANOUT_CAP` (default 4) is a runtime limit, not a planning cap. The rolling top-up re-run of
  `open-ready` (admitting a NEW member as a slot frees) drains a wider READ fan-out only; a WRITE
  frontier wider than `FANOUT_CAP` does NOT top-up into a live lane group (group membership /
  `write_union` / baseline are fixed at group formation, and `write_node_exclusive` fires while any
  member is live) — it runs as fixed group waves: the first ≤cap members form a group and run to
  completion (each wave paying its own synthesizer-merge + group barrier), then the next wave forms
  as a NEW group, so makespan is the sum of the per-wave maxima, not a rolling drain.
  `KAOLA_FANOUT_CAP_READONLY` (default 8) applies to read-only fan-out.
- Planner-proven-disjoint (`parallel_safe`), shared-infra, and coarse (same non-shared
  top-level area, exact-file-disjoint — e.g. two cross-edition antichains both under
  `plugins/`) write frontiers ALL co-open in isolated legs BY DEFAULT — no operator toggles —
  under the retained net (a post-dominating `code-reviewer` gate over the legs, no PROTECTED
  file in either set). Serial (`max_concurrent=1`) is the FALLBACK only for a genuine
  exact-path overlap (same file or a case-collision), a directory/glob-shaped entry that
  cannot prove exact-path disjointness, the retained net not holding, hosts without worktree
  support, or an explicit `KAOLA_PARALLEL_WRITES=0` opt-out; `--write-overlap-consent` is
  parsed for frozen-plan back-compat but is VESTIGIAL at this seam — see the leg-isolation
  note below. `opening` marker + `reconcile-running-set` handle crash-resume.
  `test_thrash` ≥ 3: escalate via `write-halt --reason test_thrash`.

<!-- PIN: gate-instrumentation-provisioning -->
**A `main-session-gate` node body never instructs authoring files — it verifies.** When gate
instrumentation is needed to run the check (a probe scene/test/fixture, including build wiring),
an UPSTREAM writer node provisions it inside that node's own declared write set; the gate only
runs what was provisioned. A gate-window fence backs this at runtime: an in-worktree out-of-band
Write/Edit while a `main-session-gate` is open is denied by default (`KAOLA_GATE_WINDOW_FENCE=0`
opt-out); legal exits are provisioning via an upstream writer node, `route-findings`/`repair-node`,
or `write-halt --reason consent`.

<!-- PIN: leg-isolation-recipe -->
**Write-parallelism is default-on for disjoint AND same-area (coarse) frontiers.** The per-leg
isolation engine is COMPLETE and live, and every exact-file-disjoint write frontier —
planner-proven-disjoint (`parallel_safe`) siblings in different top-level areas, a shared-infra
frontier in the same infra area, or a coarse frontier in the same non-shared top-level area
(e.g. two cross-edition antichains both under `plugins/`) — co-opens as isolated parallel legs
**BY DEFAULT — no operator toggles**, gated only on the retained net: a post-dominating
`code-reviewer` gate over the legs, and no PROTECTED file in either set. Per-leg worktree
isolation + the mandatory synthesizer reconcile are the correctness net; co-open ALWAYS
provisions a dedicated leg per write sibling (group-form ⟺ legs provisioned — never the legless
attribution-blind union barrier).
- Serial is the FALLBACK only for a genuine exact-path overlap (same file or a case-collision), a
  directory/glob-shaped entry that cannot prove exact-path disjointness, the retained net not
  holding (no post-dominating gate, or a PROTECTED file in either set), hosts without worktree
  support, or an explicit `KAOLA_PARALLEL_WRITES=0` opt-out (which forces serial).
- `--write-overlap-consent` and `write_overlap_policy` are parsed for frozen-plan back-compat but
  are VESTIGIAL at this seam — they neither enable nor block any co-open decision here. A
  genuinely-overlapping (exact-path or case-collision) frontier serial-degrades regardless of
  consent — no cross-contamination, no silent loss. No consent flag is needed for any disjoint,
  shared-infra, or coarse frontier.

<!-- CARD: speculative-open -->
On `open-next` → `gate_not_complete` with a speculative gate (`speculative_open_policy: auto` — the
freeze-time default — or `consent`, in plan `## Meta`): `docs/plan-run-cards/speculative-open.md`
(covers `open-ready`'s speculative activation — automatic at `auto`, `--speculative-consent` at
`consent` — `discard-speculative`, gate verdict:fail rollback)

**Speculative gate-overlap is default-on** (`speculative_open_policy: auto` — the freeze-time
default; the three tiers are `auto` / `consent` / `off`). A node blocked only by a still-open gate
opens the moment `open-ready` runs; `--speculative-consent` is a no-op at `auto` and required only at
`consent`, and plain serial waiting is the DEGRADED path (the sole behavior at `off`). Eligibility,
write-speculation safety, discard, and telemetry mechanics live in the card above.
- **Write-leg dispatch discipline.** Isolation is **discipline-dependent, not transparent** —
  the Agent tool has no cwd parameter and a provisioned `.kw/legs/<project>/<node>` leg does NOT auto-redirect
  a leg agent's edits. Dispatch each leg with its member's **`dispatch.leg_path`** (and `dispatch.leg_branch`)
  from the `open-ready` payload — every `Edit`/`Write` uses an absolute `<dispatch.leg_path>/...` path and
  every Bash uses `cd "<dispatch.leg_path>" &&` (the load-bearing instruction in the leg brief), removing the
  need for a laneGroup cross-reference (the laneGroup descriptor remains for observability). The failure mode
  is **fail-closed containment, not construction**: a relative-path own-lane slip
  lands in the parent (invisible to the per-leg barrier, exempt from the write-lane hook) and is caught by
  the **parent-clean fence** before the merge → `merge_conflict`/repair, never silent cross-contamination or
  silent loss. **Bounded thrash:** after **K = 2** repair nudges on an agent that keeps writing out-of-lane,
  escalate to a `merge_conflict` halt rather than looping.
- `merge_conflict` (write-overlap): a write-leg level whose FIRST-detection refusal —
  `member_vacuity` (a no-op leg), `write_set_overflow` (an overflow), or the synthesizer's octopus
  bail (a real same-file conflict) — survives `MERGE_CONFLICT_REPAIR_LIMIT` (K=3) bounded repairs.
  Repair each first by its own recovery (re-dispatch the leg · `revert-overflow` · a reasoning-class
  (non-lowerable floor) `synthesizer` agent resolves a real conflict by intent), re-running `close-node`; on
  the K-th failure escalate via `write-halt --reason merge_conflict`. Routed exactly like `test_thrash`
  (a schema constant the orchestrator applies — NO script counter on the adaptive path); the
  COMMIT-based union barrier on M, never the counter, is the fail-closed gate, so a resumed run safely
  re-counts from zero. RESUMABLE consent-style halt — resolve, then `clear-halt --reason consent`.

**Evidence-persistence contract per runtime and role-kind.** The authoritative inter-node handoff is
always the full nonce-bound `.cache/<node-id>.md` artifact. A self-writing role returns only a compact
summary after persisting it. On runtimes that enforce a read-only role tool manifest, the role instead
returns the full body as transport for orchestrator persistence; after that write, the cache artifact is
again authoritative. The mechanism is derived from each role's tool manifest — no hand-list, no per-agent guesswork:
- Any node role WITHOUT `Write` in its tool manifest CANNOT self-write `.cache` evidence — it
  RETURNS its deliverable for orchestrator persistence via `record-evidence --stdin` (below).
  `record-evidence` re-injects this node's `evidence-binding:` header, so persisting evidence
  cannot strip the header — the role MUST NOT try to add or modify it. Current roster (EXAMPLES
  only): read producers `code-explorer`, `knowledge-lookup`, `code-architect`, `planner`,
  `issue-scout`; plus the read gates `adversarial-verifier` / `code-reviewer` /
  `security-reviewer`.
- Any node role WITH `Write` in its tool manifest SELF-WRITES its `.cache` evidence, INCLUDING
  the seeded `evidence-binding:` header (read it from the seeded file, never alter it). Current
  roster (EXAMPLES only): `implementer`, `tdd-guide`, `metric-optimizer`, `build-error-resolver`,
  `doc-updater`, `synthesizer`.

**Codex 0.144 durable-result override.** Every Codex node-role profile, including a logically read-only
research/review role, MUST write its FULL structured deliverable directly to the exact
`dispatch.evidence_file` before sending its final message. For a read-only role this one seeded
workflow-cache file is the sole write exception; repository/product files remain forbidden. Read the
existing `evidence-binding: <node-id> <nonce>` header, preserve it byte-for-byte, and append/replace
only the body below it. The cache body must include every required token, verdict/finding row, source,
and upstream-read attestation. The final message to the main orchestrator is deliberately compact:
`<node-id> <role>: <verdict|outcome>; evidence=<dispatch.evidence_file>` — never retransmit the full
deliverable as the only durable copy.

After the child stops, validate the on-disk artifact before closing or opening a dependent node:

```bash
node "$KAOLA_SCRIPTS/kaola-gitlab-workflow-adaptive-node.js" record-evidence \
  --project {project} --node-id {node-id} --verify --json
```

Only `result: ok` makes that artifact eligible for `dispatch.upstream_evidence`. If the parent-side
summary is disconnected or cannot be decrypted but the child is terminal and this verification is
green, read the compact outcome/verdict from the cache, record
`delegation_outcome: returned_partial` plus `transport_error: encrypted_return`, and continue from the
durable artifact. If verification is absent or red, leave the node open and route repair; a seed-only
file never counts as completed work.

<!-- CARD: metric-optimizer -->
A `metric-optimizer` node's dispatch card carries `dispatch.optimize` (the frozen
`optimize(<node-id>)` metric contract) and may override `dispatch.wait_budget_minutes` from
the contract's `budget_wallclock_minutes`. Full ratchet protocol:
`docs/plan-run-cards/metric-optimizer.md` (covers the propose/apply/regression-gate/measure/
accept-or-reject loop, the `metric: <number>` output contract, scoped-revert safety, stop
conditions, and the five evidence tokens).

On every return, before evidence/close bookkeeping, announce the compact outcome:

```text
← {node_id} · {role} returned: {verdict or one-line outcome}
```

For a returned full body that still needs parent-side persistence, record it with stdin:

```bash
node "$KAOLA_SCRIPTS/kaola-gitlab-workflow-adaptive-node.js" record-evidence \
  --project {project} --node-id {node-id} --stdin --json
```

For a self-written artifact, never overwrite it with the compact summary; use `record-evidence
--verify` as shown above.

### 4. Close and advance

```bash
node "$KAOLA_SCRIPTS/kaola-gitlab-workflow-adaptive-node.js" close-and-open-next \
  --project {project} --node-id {node-id} --json --summary
```

Enforces (in order): evidence-shape check → barrier (`plan_hash` re-verified, diff against
baseline, `post-dominate` gate check, `escalated_to_full: consent` / `typed refusal` on lane
overflow) → close + compliance row → selector routing → fused advance. Returns
`{closed:{...}, opened:{...}|null, allDone}` or `result: refuse`.

After every close, print the required progress line:

```text
{node-id} → complete; opened: {next-id|—}
```

On `result: ok` + `opened`: dispatch the next node (step 3).
On `allDone: true`: run chains then route to Finalization.
On `opened: null` + `allDone: false` (the typed `reason: 'frontier_blocked'` signal):
do NOT park silently. Deterministically re-run `orient` then `open-next` / `open-ready` to re-open
the recomputed frontier, draining toward `allDone` WITHOUT operator prompting. Cap the re-orient at
a small bound (e.g. 3 consecutive `frontier_blocked` cycles with no progress) before escalating with
stop+ask — a blocked-but-not-done frontier must never silently stall the run.

**Surface the narrowed barrier reason VERBATIM.** On a `barrier_failed` / `close-node`
refusal the ACTIONABLE narrowed reason (`write_set_overflow` / `write_set_granularity` /
`lockfile_write` / …) and the offending paths are now on the top-level `reason` / `outOfAllow`
fields. Surface them VERBATIM — print the full `reason` / `operator_hint` / `outOfAllow` — never
route the refusal through a lossy JSON-summary helper that truncates it.

<!-- CARD: repair-routing -->
**Authoritative failed-review repair protocol.** `review_failed` is a settled failed transaction.
Read the authoritative `review-attempts.json` attempt (`attempt_id`, `logical_gate`, `outcome`,
`reason`, `route_candidates`, `lifecycle_settled`, `repair`, and `consumed_by`), choose the
writer as an agent decision from the frozen DAG and canonical `ownership_candidates`, then invoke
`repair-node --attempt-id {attempt_id} --node-id {agent-selected-writer}`. The harness never selects
a repair owner and never rewrites the DAG. On retry or reconciliation, reread the journal and resume
the same attempt; treat `findings-route.json` only as a regenerable projection, never as authority.
`repair_requires_replan` is a zero-mutation refusal; an unresolved attempt makes `reopen-node`
refuse with `review_attempt_unresolved`. Five consumed repairs are allowed per canonical logical
gate; the sixth returns `repair_limit_reached`. Zero candidates and multiple candidates leave
`owning_node: null`; multiple owners never imply selection.

On barrier refusal / `route-findings` result: `docs/plan-run-cards/repair-routing.md`
(covers `write_set_granularity` / `write_set_overflow` / `sensitive_write_unreviewed` /
`foreign_archive` / `unattributed_write`; `revert-overflow` vs `repair-node`; `halt for consent`;
`write-halt --reason consent`; `escalated_to_full: consent` / `escalated_to_full: security`;
`triage` / `proposed_repair` object; plan-repair via `--freeze`; `--forbidden-only` check)

<!-- CARD: reopen-complete-node -->
On reopening a complete node: `docs/plan-run-cards/reopen-complete-node.md`
(covers `reopen-node` for Finalization-surfaced failures; `would_orphan_in_progress` refusal;
`mid-gate` repair; `read-only` fan-out quorum bounded controller; `LOOP_CAP` / `dry_streak`;
`test_thrash` escalation; `validateNodeOutput` absent-but-never-script-enforced note)

<!-- CARD: frontier-batch -->
**Dispatch fidelity — concurrent dispatch is the DEFAULT, not an option.** `open-next` (and
`orient` / `close-and-open-next`) return `enterBatch: true` + a `frontier: [...]` whenever the planner
authored an INDEPENDENT frontier of width ≥2 — that is authored parallelism, and you MUST run it as
authored. On `enterBatch: true`: run `open-ready` (it marks the whole frontier `in_progress`), then
dispatch the returned nodes' role agents **in ONE assistant message** — multiple `Agent` calls in a
single turn. The single-message dispatch is the *only* thing that yields real concurrency; dispatching
one agent per turn is itself a serial barrier and silently serializes a frontier the planner authored as
parallel. Do NOT `open-next`-then-single-dispatch a ≥2 frontier (the script now refuses to single-open
it). **Width stays the planner's scope-driven call:** a width-1 frontier or a dependency chain returns
NO `enterBatch` and runs serially (the normal single-dispatch path) — never force a minimum width, a
"default to ≥2," or a "prefer wide" posture.

On `enterBatch: true` the concurrent one-message dispatch above is the DEFAULT (not optional); this card
covers only the running-set MECHANICS (`open-ready` / `close-node` / `reconcile-running-set`;
write-role lane-group co-open in isolated legs; crash repair) for each frontier
unit:

<!-- PIN: frontier unit -->
frontier unit

`docs/plan-run-cards/frontier-batch.md`
(covers `open-ready` / `close-node` / `reconcile-running-set`; write-role lane-group co-open in
isolated legs, the synthesizer + group barrier close; the `opening` crash-safe marker; `FANOUT_CAP`
vs `KAOLA_FANOUT_CAP_READONLY`)

### 5. All done

When `allDone: true`, detect the repo type and run the terminal validation appropriate to that repo, then delegate to
`kaola-workflow-finalize {project}`. Finalization's sink step owns its own crash-resume journals
(`sink-receipt.json` / `sink-fallback.json`) and disposes of them itself at terminal success; if a
stray one turns up on a later `clean and synced` check, delete it — never commit it.

**Self-host (npm) — `package.json` declares `test:kaola-workflow:*` scripts:** Run `run-chains.js`
with `--project {project}`.

**Invoke run-chains with `--project {project}`.** Always pass `--project {project}` to the
run-chains script so its receipt lands at `kaola-workflow/{project}/.cache/chain-receipt.json` where
Finalization's `--finalize-check` reads it — do NOT rely on cwd to locate the receipt.
The self-host chain receipt stamp is the last action before Finalization: run it only after every
code change and every test-consumed prose/doc update for the final candidate has landed. If any
code-relevant or chain-asserted doc changes after the stamp, the receipt is stale and
`chains_stale` requires a full re-run of the gated runner; do not patch or hand-edit the receipt.
Workflow state and inert, non-test-consumed docs are validation-invisible and do not stale the
receipt.

**Consumer (non-npm) repo — no `test:kaola-workflow:*` scripts:** Do NOT invoke `run-chains.js`
(it can only return `chains_config_missing` in a consumer repo). Instead, run the plan's `## Meta`
`validation_command` and record the result in `kaola-workflow/{project}/.cache/final-validation.md`
with a column-0 `verdict: pass`. Finalization's `--finalize-check` auto-detects consumer mode
(absence of the `test:kaola-workflow:*` scripts) and gates on `final-validation.md`.
If an unchanged terminal change-gate validation run already covers the final candidate, you may
cite that evidence instead of rerunning. Record column-0 lines for `verdict: pass`,
`source: cited:<node-id>`, `validated_command`, `validated_at_head`, and `reuse_boundary`; if
there is any doubt about the boundary, run the command.
After recording the verdict (and the citation fields when citing), bind the evidence to the exact
candidate it validated: run the plan-validator (`$KAOLA_SCRIPTS/…-plan-validator.js`) over
`kaola-workflow/{project}/workflow-plan.md` with `--candidate-hash --json` and record the emitted
value as a column-0 `validated_candidate_hash:` line in `final-validation.md`. Compute it LAST —
after every file the validation covered has landed; any later relevant edit stales the binding and
`--finalize-check` refuses `final_validation_stale` (re-run the validation command and re-record
with a fresh hash — never hand-patch the hash), while a missing line refuses
`final_validation_unbound`. Workflow state and inert, non-test-consumed docs are
validation-invisible and do not stale the binding; the gate compares the recorded hash to a
recomputation and never re-runs tests.

**Run-Gap Manual Seeding.** When the orchestrator observes a run gap the automated scanners
cannot see — transient tool noise, a manual retry, an environmental flake — append a
`gap: <class> — <text>` line to `kaola-workflow/{project}/.cache/run-gaps-manual.md`
immediately, BEFORE Finalization's gap sweep runs, so the mapping to `noise:`/`filed:` is
machine-checked, never vacuous. A `## Run gaps` entry with no matching seeded/scanned source
refuses `observed_gap_unseeded` at Finalization.

#### Validation De-Duplication

Avoid redundant validation runs.

- During the run, each node validates only its affected task scope, not the full
  project, unless the node plan explicitly requires a full command or the touched
  surface is high risk.
- If a node's recorded check already passed against the same relevant file set and no
  relevant files changed afterward, cite the prior node evidence path
  (`.cache/{node-id}.md`) instead of rerunning it.
- After any routed fix or Trivial Inline Edit Exception edit, rerun only the affected
  node command unless the fix changes shared infrastructure.
- Run the full chains once here at All-done, not per node; that is the single
  full-suite pass before Finalization.
- Use the `validation_command` recorded in the plan `## Meta` for any full-suite
  validation; do not re-derive a per-node command (the record-once discipline).
- **State the actual reuse boundary, not a false absolute.** When you cite a
  prior node run instead of rerunning, record WHICH node/state that run covered and that
  any later edits are outside it. Do NOT write a terminal absolute like `No files changed
  after those runs` when a node afterward changes relevant files — say e.g. `validation
  reuse covers code/test impact through node nN; the later edit is docs-only and outside
  the rerun trigger`. Consumer final-validation citations must also record `source: cited:<node-id>`,
  `validated_command`, `validated_at_head`, and `reuse_boundary`; uncertainty means run the command.
  A citation still requires a fresh `validated_candidate_hash:` line computed at citation time —
  the binding is what proves the tree is unchanged; if the hash no longer matches at finalize, the
  cited run does not cover the candidate and the command must be re-run.
