description: >
  Drives the implementation of one or more Scrum stories by dispatching to the
  correct downstream create-/update- skill per epic. Accepts a story ID, a
  comma-separated list, an epic ID (topo-sorted by Depends On), or a Sprint
  label (e.g. "Sprint 3"). Never edits story markdown itself — it only
  orchestrates the generators and surfaces their results.
  Use when the user asks to:
  - Implement STORY-NN-NNN or a list of stories
  - "Implement EPIC-02" / "Implement all of Sprint 3"
  - Build the next story in the backlog
  - Drive story-mode generation across several stories in one turn
argument-hint: "[STORY-NN-NNN | EPIC-NN | 'Sprint N' | comma-list]"

# Implement Scrum Stories

You are the orchestrator for the existing `create-*` / `update-*` skills.
Your job is to walk one or more stories through their generator in the correct
order, stop on the first CRITICAL failure, and hand off to
`/developer-plugin:validate-stories` when the batch finishes.

You do NOT edit story markdown files. You do NOT flip Status fields. You do
NOT tick acceptance-criteria checkboxes. Those mutations belong to
`/developer-plugin:complete-stories` after validation passes.

## Workspace Discovery

Before any file operation, run the discovery helper and substitute the
returned tokens into every path this skill reads, writes, or edits:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/validate-stories/scripts/status_rollup.py --mode discover
```

The JSON output supplies `{workspace_root}`, `{project_root}`,
`{project_name}`, `{stories_dir}`, and `{learnings_queue}`. The plugin is
project-agnostic — never hardcode project or chapter names in edits.

## Coding Patterns & Libraries Handbook (orchestrator-level)

Before dispatching to any sub-skill, the orchestrator runs the freshness
check ONCE so every downstream generator inherits an up-to-date library
cache without re-prompting:

```bash
PATTERNS_DIR=$(ls -d "{workspace_root}/inputs/code/v"* 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)
if [ -z "$PATTERNS_DIR" ] || [ ! -d "$PATTERNS_DIR" ]; then
  echo "CRITICAL: inputs/code/v*/ not found. Run /developer-plugin:refresh-libraries to initialize the library cache."
  exit 1
fi
LIBRARIES_FILE="$PATTERNS_DIR/LIBRARIES.md"
LAST_VERIFIED=$(grep '^last_verified:' "$LIBRARIES_FILE" | awk '{print $2}')
TODAY=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)
AGE_DAYS=$(python3 -c "from datetime import date; print((date.fromisoformat('$TODAY') - date.fromisoformat('$LAST_VERIFIED')).days")
```

If `AGE_DAYS > 30`, call **AskUserQuestion** *once* with options `Refresh now` / `Proceed with cached versions` / `Cancel`:

- `Refresh now` — invoke `/developer-plugin:refresh-libraries`, wait for completion, then continue dispatching.
- `Proceed with cached versions` — dispatch sub-skills with the cached versions; prepend a single stale-cache warning to the batch's final References trailer.
- `Cancel` — abort the batch; no stories run.

**Do not** let each sub-skill re-prompt — the orchestrator answers once for the whole batch. Downstream create-*/update-* skills skip their own freshness check when invoked from this skill (detect via an env var such as `DEVPLUGIN_FRESHNESS_OK=1`).

Read `$PATTERNS_DIR/LIBRARIES.md` in full so versions are available to any sub-skill that asks.

## Dispatch (content-based classification — no config)

There is NO dispatch yaml. Story and epic numbers are not stable across
projects — `EPIC-02` may be ingestion in one project and something else in
another. Each story is classified by its acceptance-criteria content:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/validate-stories/scripts/status_rollup.py \
  --mode classify --story STORY-NN-NNN
```

The JSON output includes `skill_kind` — one of `scaffold`, `dag`,
`ingestion`, `pipeline`, `integration-test`, `deploy-validation`, or
`unknown` — plus `confidence` (`high` / `low`) and a `reasons[]` list
citing the AC matches that produced the verdict.

Map `skill_kind` to the generator by literal convention (no lookup):

| `skill_kind`         | create skill                | update skill                  | validate skill        |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `scaffold`           | `create-scaffold`           | `update-scaffold`             | `validate-scaffold`   |
| `dag`                | `create-dag`                | `update-dag`                  | `validate-dag`        |
| `ingestion`          | `create-ingestion`          | `update-ingestion`            | `validate-ingestion`  |
| `pipeline`           | `create-pipeline`           | `update-pipeline`             | `validate-pipeline`   |
| `silver`             | `create-silver`             | `update-silver`               | `validate-silver`     |
| `gold`               | `create-gold`                | `update-gold`                 | `validate-gold`       |
| `integration-test`   | `create-integration-test`   | `create-integration-test` (re-emit; idempotent) | `validate-stories` (story-scoped AC verifier) |
| `deploy-validation`  | `create-deploy-validation`  | `create-deploy-validation` (re-emit; idempotent) | `validate-stories` (story-scoped AC verifier) |
| `unknown`            | — (see Phase 2 Step 3)      | —                             | —                     |

**Story-type → skill-kind shortcut.** When the story's `Story Type`
metadata is `integration-test` or `deploy-validation`, route to the
matching kind directly — the AC text for those story types is mostly
runtime behaviour (no path tokens), so the classifier's path-matching
will not find an owner. Use the story-type cell as authoritative for
those two kinds.

If `skill_kind == "unknown"` OR `confidence == "low"`, stop the batch and
ask the user via `AskUserQuestion`, showing the `reasons[]` so they can
override. Record any override as a learning (Phase 5).

A downstream generator MAY accept a `STORY-NN-NNN` argument directly (story
mode) — forward the story ID verbatim when it does. Otherwise forward the LLD
path (full mode) and tell the user only the covered story's deliverables will
be reviewed from that run. Classification does not distinguish the two modes;
detection is the invoked skill's responsibility.

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Resolve Target Set

**FIRST — resolve the target argument via the shared resolver.**

This skill runs with `context: fork` (see frontmatter). The slash-command
`$ARGUMENTS` substitution is performed in the *top-level* expansion and
**does NOT cross into the forked subagent** — inside the fork `$ARGUMENTS`
is empty regardless of what the user typed or what the Skill-tool caller
passed (learning **L-001**). Do NOT read `$ARGUMENTS` directly as the
target; it is unreliable here. The single reliable channel is the shared
resolver `scripts/resolve_skill_arg.sh`, which returns the target from the
first available of, in order:

1. `$SKILL_ARG` environment variable
2. `{workspace_root}/.skill-arg` file (consumed — deleted after read)
3. the conversational argument `$1`
4. `$CLAUDE_AUTO_MODE=1` / `.auto-mode` marker → `__AUTO__`

The caller that invokes this skill (the main-loop agent via the Skill
tool, or a parent orchestrator) MUST seed the target before dispatch by
writing it to `{workspace_root}/.skill-arg` (or exporting `SKILL_ARG`),
because the fork cannot see `$ARGUMENTS`. Resolve as the FIRST step:

```bash
eval "$(WORKSPACE_ROOT={workspace_root} \
  bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/resolve_skill_arg.sh "$ARGUMENTS" \
  | awk 'NR==1{print "RESOLVED_ARG=\""$0"\""} NR==2{print "RESOLVED_SOURCE=\""$0"\""}')"
```

`RESOLVED_ARG` is the target string (`STORY-02-002`, `EPIC-02`,
`Sprint 3`, or a comma-list); `RESOLVED_SOURCE` records which channel
supplied it (`SKILL_ARG | .skill-arg | conversational | __AUTO__ | EMPTY`).

If `RESOLVED_ARG` is non-empty, that is the target — proceed to Step 1
(parse / normalize). If it is empty (`RESOLVED_SOURCE=EMPTY`), ask the
user via `AskUserQuestion` what to implement. Never guess a target and
never silently fall back to "the first un-Done epic".

**Resolution-source banner (mandatory, every run).** As the *first line*
of skill output, before any other work, echo the resolved target AND its
source so a lost arg is visible immediately:

```
RESOLVED TARGET: <RESOLVED_ARG>  (source: <RESOLVED_SOURCE>)
```

If empty, print `RESOLVED TARGET: <none — prompting user>  (source: EMPTY)`
and invoke `AskUserQuestion` before doing anything else.

**Mandatory confirm (cannot be skipped).** Phase 0 Step 3's
`AskUserQuestion` gate runs on **every** invocation. The banner above
makes a wrong/empty target visible; the Step 3 gate then lets the user
redirect before any plan JSON is written. Skipping the confirm to "save
a turn" is a defect.

#### Version lockfile (pinned upstream v{N})

Before any dispatch, run:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/resolve_versions.py --write
```

This creates `{workspace_root}/outputs/dev-lock.yaml` pinning the exact v{N}
folder for each upstream (`lld`, `stm`, `dqs`, `stories`) for the duration
of this batch. Every downstream create-*/update-* skill sources the same
file — they never re-resolve `ls -d outputs/*/v* | tail -1` on their own
once the lockfile is present. Delete the lockfile to re-pin on the next
batch.

#### Bootstrap gate (chicken-and-egg)

Check the discovery result:

```bash
DISCOVERY=$(python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/validate-stories/scripts/status_rollup.py --mode discover)
NEEDS_BOOTSTRAP=$(echo "$DISCOVERY" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('needs_bootstrap', False))")
```

If `needs_bootstrap == True`, classify every story in the target set (via
`status_rollup.py --mode classify`). If at least one classifies to
`scaffold`, dispatch `/developer-plugin:create-scaffold` FIRST (passing
the original target as the Skill-tool argument), wait for completion,
then re-run discovery before continuing. `create-scaffold` handles the cookiecutter
bootstrap as its first step.

If `needs_bootstrap == True` but NO story in the target set classifies to
`scaffold`, stop with CRITICAL: `project not bootstrapped — run /developer-plugin:create-scaffold first, or include a foundation story in the target set`.
This keeps the bootstrap gate tied to **kind** (`scaffold`), not to a
specific epic number — any project's foundation epic, numbered however
the reader's scrum-master emitted it, triggers the gate.

**Step 1 — Parse the argument into an ordered story list.**

Argument grammar (shared with validate-stories and complete-stories):

| Form                     | Example                            | Meaning                                             |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `STORY-NN-NNN`           | `STORY-02-002`                     | single story                                        |
| comma-list               | `STORY-02-001,STORY-02-002`        | ordered list — respect declared `Depends On`        |
| `EPIC-NN`                | `EPIC-02`                          | every child story, topo-sorted                      |
| `Sprint N`               | `Sprint 3`                         | every story whose `Sprint` cell is `Sprint N`       |
| (empty resolution)       | `RESOLVED_SOURCE=EMPTY`            | no target supplied → ask the user via `AskUserQuestion`; never guess |

Normalize the argument exactly as `create-ingestion` Phase 0 does:
uppercase, zero-padded (`"story 2 of epic 2"` → `STORY-02-002`). Reject
ranges (`STORY-02-001..003`) explicitly — they are not supported.

**Step 2 — For `EPIC-NN` / `Sprint N`, expand to stories and topo-sort.**

Use the helper:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/validate-stories/scripts/status_rollup.py \
  --mode parse-epic --epic EPIC-02
```

Read the `child_stories` array. Build a DAG from each story's `depends_on`
field and emit the stories in topological order. If a cycle is detected,
stop with a CRITICAL: `cycle detected: A → B → A`.

For `Sprint N`, parse every story file under the latest
`{stories_dir}/v*/` (from discovery) and filter by `sprint == "Sprint N"`,
then topo-sort the same way.

**Step 3 — Show the resolved list and confirm (mandatory).**

This `AskUserQuestion` gate is the last guard before plans are persisted
and sub-skills mutate the project. It runs on **every** invocation. The
prompt MUST surface (a) the resolved target (`RESOLVED_ARG`, matching
the banner above) and (b) the ordered story list, so a lost or wrong arg
becomes visible *here*, not after EPIC-01 plans overwrite EPIC-02 work:

```
RESOLVED TARGET: EPIC-02

About to implement 3 stories in this order:
  1. STORY-02-001 — Per-Table YAML Ingestion Configs   (create-ingestion)
  2. STORY-02-002 — Generic Ingestion Runner           (create-ingestion)
  3. STORY-02-003 — SparkSubmitOperator Wrapper        (update-ingestion — file exists)

Proceed? (Yes / No / Edit order)
```

If the user picks Edit, ask which stories to keep or reorder, then re-confirm.
If the user picks No, exit cleanly with no plan writes and no dispatches.

### Phase 1: Pre-flight

For each target story, call:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/validate-stories/scripts/status_rollup.py \
  --mode parse-story --story STORY-NN-NNN
```

From the JSON:

- If `status == "Done"` → **skip** (single-line log: `STORY-NN-NNN already Done — skipped`). Never re-dispatch.
- If `epic_id`'s epic file has `status == "Done"` but this story is not Done → stale backlog. Stop and tell the user to resolve the drift before continuing.
- If the story file is not found → stop with the error from the helper.

### Phase 1.5: Build and Persist the Story Plan

Every story gets a **persistent execution plan** — the single ledger that
`implement-stories`, `validate-stories`, and `complete-stories` all read
and enrich. One plan per story, located at
`{stories_dir}/v{N}/plans/STORY-NN-NNN.plan.json`.

Before dispatching any sub-skill, build (or refresh) the plan:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/validate-stories/scripts/status_rollup.py \
  --mode build-plan --story STORY-NN-NNN --save
```

The plan captures:
- `tasks[]` — one per (skill, paths) group from `extract-deliverables`,
  in `dispatch_order`, with a `depends_on` chain so later tasks wait for
  earlier ones.
- `acceptance_criteria[]` — every AC line linked to the task(s) whose
  deliverable paths cover its backtick-quoted tokens. Behavioural ACs
  (no tokens) link to every task so any validator can attempt coverage.
- `status: planned` initially; walks `planned → in_progress → implemented
  → validated → done` over the three phases; or `failed` at any step.

If the scrum-master re-runs and an AC or deliverable changes, re-running
`build-plan --save` overwrites the plan and increments `plan_version`.
Prior task outcomes are NOT preserved across re-builds — callers that
care should compare `plan_version`.

### Phase 2: Dispatch (multi-skill, path-based, plan-driven)

This phase is path-based, not kind-based. A single story whose ACs name
deliverables under two skills' domains (e.g. an ingestion module AND the
DAG task that wires it in) dispatches to BOTH skills in sequence, each
scoped to the paths it owns. No skill ever sees paths outside its domain.

The routing registry is
`{workspace_root}/inputs/code/v*/DELIVERABLE-OWNERS.yaml` — a reader's
extension point for re-routing path classes (e.g. swapping Airflow for
Dagster).

**Step 1 — Extract deliverables for each story.**

For each story in the resolved list:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/validate-stories/scripts/status_rollup.py \
  --mode extract-deliverables --story STORY-NN-NNN
```

The JSON output contains:
- `paths` — every backtick-quoted path from the AC (placeholders stripped).
- `by_skill` — paths grouped by owning skill from the registry.
- `dispatch_order` — the order to invoke those skills (from the
  registry's `dispatch_order`: typically scaffold → ingestion → dag →
  pipeline).
- `unmatched` — paths no glob matched (added to `fallback_kind`'s group
  via the classifier).
- `fallback_kind` — the classifier's kind, used when `paths` is empty
  (purely behavioural ACs) or for unmatched paths.

**Step 2 — Fall-back for behavioural stories.**

If `by_skill` is empty, the story's ACs have no path tokens (behavioural
story). Dispatch the single skill named by `fallback_kind` (from the
classifier) with `STORY-NN-NNN` and no `.skill-paths` file — the sub-
skill will read the story's AC and handle it in its historical
single-skill mode.

If `fallback_kind` is also missing / `unknown`, stop the batch:

```
Cannot route STORY-NN-NNN. No deliverable paths in its AC and the
classifier returned `unknown`. Tighten the AC text to reference concrete
paths (e.g. `airflow/configs/foo.yml`, `src/<project>/bronze/...`) or
override with "treat STORY-NN-NNN as {scaffold|dag|ingestion|pipeline}".
```

Record any user override in the learnings queue (Phase 5).

**Step 3 — Per-group dispatch (plan-driven).**

Read the plan's `tasks[]` (built in Phase 1.5). For each task in order:

Before dispatching a task, update the plan:
- set `tasks[i].status = "in_progress"` and stamp `started_at`
- if this is the first task, bump plan `status = "in_progress"`

Persist the plan after every status change so a mid-batch interruption
leaves a truthful ledger. Use a simple Python one-liner:

```bash
python3 -c "
import json, sys
from datetime import datetime, timezone
p = json.load(open('$PLAN_PATH'))
for t in p['tasks']:
    if t['id'] == '$TID':
        t['status'] = '$NEW_STATUS'
        if '$NEW_STATUS' == 'in_progress' and not t['started_at']:
            t['started_at'] = datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()
        if '$NEW_STATUS' in ('done','failed'):
            t['finished_at'] = datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()
json.dump(p, open('$PLAN_PATH','w'), indent=2)
"
```

Then dispatch:

1. **Write the scoping files**:

   ```bash
   echo "STORY-NN-NNN"            > {workspace_root}/.skill-arg
   printf '%s\n' "${paths[@]}"    > {workspace_root}/.skill-paths
   ```

   The sub-skill reads both and treats `.skill-paths` as the ONLY paths
   in scope for this invocation. Both files are consumed (deleted) by the
   sub-skill after reading.

2. **Pick create-* vs update-*** using the same rule as before, but
   scoped to THIS group's paths:
   - `status == "To Do"` AND **none** of this group's paths exist on
     disk → `create-<skill>`.
   - `status == "In Progress"`, OR **any** of this group's paths
     already exist → `update-<skill>`.
   - Split (some present, some absent) → `AskUserQuestion` with the
     present/absent lists.

3. **Invoke** via the `Skill` tool and capture output.

4. **CRITICAL handling (intra-story)**: if this dispatch reports
   CRITICAL, **stop this story** (do not dispatch the subsequent groups
   for the same story — they likely depend on this one). Continue with
   the next story in the batch unless `--stop-on-critical-batch` is
   passed.

5. Append one row to the implementation log per dispatch:

   ```
   STORY-02-004 | create-ingestion | 2 files created     | OK
   STORY-02-004 | update-dag       | 1 file patched      | OK
   STORY-02-006 | create-ingestion | 1 file created      | OK
   ```

After the sub-skill returns, parse its output to populate
`tasks[i].files_created`, `files_updated`, `artifacts`, and any
`critical_findings`. Then set `tasks[i].status = "done"` (or `"failed"`
if CRITICAL) and save.

When every task has `status == "done"`, set plan `status = "implemented"`.
If any task `status == "failed"`, set plan `status = "failed"`.

**Step 3.4 — Post-dispatch handbook validator gate (tight loop).**

The AC verifier in Step 3.5 only checks what each story's Verification
block names. Pattern-handbook rules (env-driven paths, hard imports,
required test modules, etc.) live in the matching `validate-*` skill and
are invisible to the AC verifier. To catch them at write-time rather than
at end-of-batch, run the handbook validator immediately after each
create-/update- dispatch and treat its CRITICAL output as a story failure.

Validator scripts (callable directly, no Skill fork required):

| `skill_kind` | Validator script (relative to plugin root) |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `ingestion`  | `skills/validate-ingestion/scripts/validate_ingestion.py` |
| `dag`        | `skills/validate-dag/scripts/validate_dag.py`             |
| `silver`     | `skills/validate-silver/scripts/validate_silver.py`       |
| `gold`       | `skills/validate-gold/scripts/validate_gold.py`           |
| `scaffold`   | _SKILL.md-only_ — invoke `/developer-plugin:validate-scaffold` via Skill |
| `pipeline`   | _SKILL.md-only_ — invoke `/developer-plugin:validate-pipeline` via Skill |

For `ingestion` dispatches:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/validate-ingestion/scripts/validate_ingestion.py \
  --project-root <project-root> 2>&1 | tee /tmp/handbook-<story>-<task>.txt
```

For `dag` dispatches (positional path; use `--all` to recurse the project):

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/validate-dag/scripts/validate_dag.py \
  <project-root> --all 2>&1 | tee /tmp/handbook-<story>-<task>.txt
```

Parse the last line: `Result: PASS` or `Result: FAIL`.

- **`Result: PASS`** — set `tasks[i].handbook_validator = "pass"`; continue
  to Step 3.5 (AC verification).
- **`Result: FAIL`** — extract every line under `CRITICAL: <n> issue(s)`
  up to the next blank line. For each:
    1. Append the line (verbatim) to `tasks[i].critical_findings`.
    2. Set `tasks[i].handbook_validator = "fail"` AND
       `tasks[i].status = "failed"` (overrides the prior `done`).
    3. Set plan `status = "failed"`.
    4. Halt the story (same semantics as an AC inline-FAIL — do not run
       Step 3.5 for this task, do not dispatch subsequent groups for the
       same story). Continue with the next story in the batch unless
       `--stop-on-critical-batch` is passed.
    5. Log the row: `STORY-NN-NNN | <skill> | handbook FAIL: <n> CRITICAL | STOPPED`.

For `scaffold` and `pipeline` dispatches (no callable script), the
fallback is to dispatch the matching `/developer-plugin:validate-<kind>`
skill via the Skill tool and parse its final summary line the same way
(`Result: PASS|FAIL` + CRITICAL extraction). Record the same fields on
the task. When neither a script nor a Skill is available, set
`handbook_validator = "skipped"` and emit one trailer-line warning per
story affected.

Persist the plan JSON after the validator runs. This gate runs **before**
the AC verifier so a handbook FAIL halts the story without waiting for
the AC pass — most handbook violations would otherwise leak past the AC
verifier and only surface during the end-of-batch `validate-stories` run.

**Step 3.5 — Post-dispatch AC verification (tight loop).**

After each sub-skill returns and the plan is saved, run the AC verifier
for this story before dispatching the next task in the same story:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../scripts/verify_acs.py STORY-NN-NNN --json
```

Parse the JSON output (shape: a list of one story object with
`has_verification`, `overall`, and `acs[]`):

- **`has_verification: false`** — add one trailer line for the run
  summary: `STORY-NN-NNN: no Verification block — inline validation skipped.`
  Then continue as normal.
- **For each AC object with `status == "FAIL"`** (any non-`manual` check
  that failed):
    1. Determine which task to attribute the failure to:
       - If the AC has non-empty `task_ids` in `acceptance_criteria[]`
         and they include the just-completed task → that task fails.
       - If `task_ids` is empty OR doesn't reference any task in this
         story → attribute to the most recently completed task in this
         story (`tasks[-1]` whose `status == "done"`). Empty `task_ids`
         is a heuristic-population artifact, NOT a permission to ignore
         the FAIL.
    2. Append the first `check.detail` of the first failing check to
       `tasks[i].critical_findings`.
    3. Set `tasks[i].validator_status = "fail"` AND
       `tasks[i].status = "failed"` (overrides the prior `done`).
    4. Treat as CRITICAL for halt semantics: set plan
       `status = "failed"`, **stop this story**, continue the batch.
       Log the row: `STORY-NN-NNN | <skill> | AC<N> inline-FAIL | STOPPED`.
- **For `status == "PASS"`** → set `tasks[i].validator_status = "pass"`.
- **`status == "INDETERMINATE"`** never halts and never sets
  `validator_status` — leave the field as `"pending"`.

Persist the plan JSON after updates. This tight loop surfaces gaps at
the moment they appear rather than deferring them to an end-of-batch
`validate-stories` run.

**Step 4 — Verify no ROUTE-TO escapes.**

A sub-skill invoked WITH a `.skill-paths` file should never emit
`ROUTE-TO:` (every path it received was already vetted as owned). If the
output contains `ROUTE-TO:`, record a learning — the registry has a gap
for that path pattern, and a future `apply-learnings` run should propose
adding the glob.

### Phase 3: Execute

For each story in order:

1. Invoke the chosen skill via the `Skill` tool. Capture its final
   `Output Summary` text.
2. If the skill reports any CRITICAL failure (visible in its output), **stop
   the batch**. Do not continue to subsequent stories — later stories in a
   topo-sorted list typically depend on the one that just failed.
3. Append one row to your running implementation log:

   ```
   STORY-02-002 | create-ingestion | 1 file created | OK
   STORY-02-003 | update-ingestion | 0 CRITICAL, 1 WARNING | OK
   STORY-02-004 | create-ingestion | 2 CRITICAL        | STOPPED
   ```

### Phase 4: Hand-off

Print the final table. Immediately above the next-step line, emit two
**inline-validation summary** lines — one for the Step 3.4 handbook
validator verdicts, one for the Step 3.5 AC verifier verdicts — tallied
across all stories in the batch:

```
Handbook validator: <N> PASS, <M> FAIL (<story>:<critical-headline>, ...), <K> SKIPPED (no script or skill)
Inline AC verification: <N> PASS, <M> FAIL (<first-failing-story AC#>, ...), <K> SKIPPED (no verification block)
```

Then end with the exact next-step line:

```
Next: /developer-plugin:validate-stories <same-argument>
```

Do NOT run validate-stories yourself — the user chooses when to validate
(they may want to inspect the generated diff first). The inline summary
above is a heads-up, not a replacement.

### Phase 5: Learnings

If the user corrected your classification (e.g. "no, STORY-02-010 is an
ingestion test, not scaffold") or your topo-sort ordering, append a JSONL
line to the `{learnings_queue}` returned by the discovery helper:

```bash
QUEUE=$(python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/validate-stories/scripts/status_rollup.py \
  --mode discover | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['learnings_queue'])")
echo '{"skill": "implement-stories", "date": "'$(date +%F)'", "correction": "<quoted user correction>", "pattern": "<generalized rule>", "status": "pending"}' >> "$QUEUE"
```

The existing PostToolUse `check-learnings-queue.py` hook will remind you to
run `/developer-plugin:apply-learnings` at session end.

## Output Summary

End every run with this table (one row per target story):

```
Target: EPIC-02  |  Resolved: 3 stories  |  Dispatched: 3  |  Stopped: 0

Order | Story         | Skill              | Result
    1 | STORY-02-001  | create-ingestion   | 13 configs created, validate-ingestion PASS
    2 | STORY-02-002  | create-ingestion   | 1 module created,  validate-ingestion PASS
    3 | STORY-02-003  | update-ingestion   | 1 module edited,   validate-ingestion PASS

Next: /developer-plugin:validate-stories EPIC-02
```

## Edge Cases (must handle)

- **Lowercase arg** (`story-02-002`) → normalize to uppercase silently.
- **Circular `Depends On`** → detect during topo-sort, stop with CRITICAL.
- **Story already Done** → single-line skip log; never re-dispatch.
- **Multiple backlog files** → helper picks the lexicographically latest non-`.bak`.
- **`AskUserQuestion` unavailable** → default to the conservative choice
  (`update-*` when deliverable exists, else `create-*`) and log the decision.
- **Generator fails mid-batch** → stop, print log so far, tell the user which
  story to fix before re-invoking.

## Learnings & Corrections

### Active Learnings

- **L-001** (2026-05-11): Always: When a forked skill returns asking for a target, the orchestrator should retry with the conversational arg explicitly OR detect that .skill-arg was not consumed (file still present after invocation) and surface a CRITICAL halt rather than silently moving on.
- **L-002** (2026-05-11): Always: When story AC glob conflicts with LLD/project convention, halt and recommend scrum-master:update-stories rather than rename project-wide
- **L-003** (2026-05-11): Always: When a path appears under a glob pattern like `contracts/{table}.yml` inside an AC line that describes ingestion behaviour, treat it as a reference dependency, not a scaffold deliverable; DELIVERABLE-OWNERS.yaml should distinguish contracts paths only when the AC explicitly says create/update/author/define.
- **L-004** (2026-05-11): Always: When AC Verification uses grep_count equals:N where N == file count, but each file legitimately contains multiple matches, the verification spec is wrong; flag to scrum-master for spec correction rather than reduce real rule content.
- **L-005** (2026-05-11): Always: When extract-deliverables sees a backtick-quoted path that already exists AND is referenced in an AC as a source/input (e.g. "uses StructType from contracts/{table}.yml"), do not emit a scaffold task. Only emit a task for the skill that owns the AC verb ("adds", "writes", "calls", "creates").
- **L-006** (2026-05-11): Always: When the handbook validator (Step 3.4) reports CRITICAL issues, intersect each finding against the current task's paths/groups before halting. CRITICALs that name paths owned by sibling stories (not in this task's .skill-paths) should be recorded as out-of-scope and not halt the current story. Halt only when a finding cites a path the current task was responsible for.
- **L-007** (2026-05-11): Always: When the handbook validator runs after a story dispatch, filter its CRITICAL findings to ones touching the current story task paths before halting. Project-wide deficiencies that belong to later, not-yet-dispatched stories must not halt the current story.
- **L-008** (2026-05-11): Always: When a story routes to a skill that immediately ROUTE-OUTs based on its hard rules, the registry has a gap. Either (a) extend a skill to own that path class explicitly, or (b) add a new specialized skill (e.g. create-liquibase). Until then, orchestrator should detect double-route-out and either fall back to direct edits or block the batch with a clear error rather than thrashing between skills.
- **L-009** (2026-05-11): Always: Stories whose deliverables live under tests/integration/, docs/runbooks/, or deploy-validation scripts have no current owning skill. Either: (a) add an integration-test domain to update-ingestion or update-dag, (b) introduce a dedicated create-integration-test / create-runbook skill, or (c) flag such stories as manual at backlog-generation time so implement-stories does not attempt to dispatch them.
- **L-010** (2026-05-11): Always: Step 3.4 handbook validator should distinguish story-scope failures from project-wide pre-existing failures. Consider scoping the validator to the dispatched .skill-paths set, or whitelist pre-existing findings via a baseline file, so a story does not get halted by failures unrelated to its deliverables.
- **L-011** (2026-05-11): Always: When adding new skill folders to a plugin mid-session, document the reload step (e.g. /plugin reload or marketplace refresh) in the create-role-plugin / skill-scaffolding handbook. implement-stories should surface this with a clear actionable error rather than silently failing dispatch when a fallback_kind resolves to an existing-but-unregistered skill.
