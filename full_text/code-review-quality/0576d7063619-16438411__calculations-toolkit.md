# LeanIX Calculation Assistant

Comprehensive help for LeanIX Calculations: create, debug, design, and manage.

## CRITICAL: API Access

**All LeanIX API calls use MCP tools.** No shell commands, no token exchange, no curl.

- **Authentication** is handled internally by the MCP server
- **No bearer tokens** need to be managed in the skill workflow
- **No `.mcp.json` parsing** is required — MCP handles credentials automatically

Before any LeanIX tool call: if only `mcp__leanix__authenticate` and `mcp__leanix__complete_authentication` are available, tell the user to run `/mcp` and authenticate the `leanix` server (browser opens automatically). Do NOT call `authenticate` yourself or suggest `claude mcp add` — the former returns a URL without triggering the browser flow (copy-paste UX), the latter would shadow the plugin's bundled server. If `/mcp` doesn't surface tools after auth, treat it as a plugin bug.

## CRITICAL: Calculations vs Automations

Calculations are fundamentally different from Automations:

| Aspect | Calculations | Automations |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Populate computed fields | React to events with actions |
| **Trigger** | Auto-triggers on source field change | 12 explicit trigger types |
| **API calls** | **NOT allowed** | Allowed (`fetch`, GraphQL) |
| **Async** | **NOT supported** | Supported |
| **Output** | Single value (string/number/array) | Object with field names |
| **Creation** | Single API call | Two calls (script + template) |

### Two Calculation Types

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `fact-sheet` | Compute a field value on a fact sheet using its own data |
| `relation` | Compute a field value on a relation (the edge between two fact sheets) using data from either side |

---

## Anti-Patterns (Don't Do This)

| Pattern | Why It Fails                                                |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `async function main()` | Async not supported                                         |
| `await fetch(...)` | No API calls allowed                                        |
| `import` statements | No imports allowed                                          |
| `return { field: value }` | Must return single value                                    |
| `data.factSheet.field` in fact-sheet calc | Use `data.field` directly                                   |
| `data.field` in relation calc | Use `data.factSheet.field`                                  |
| Reading target field | Circular dependency error                                   |
| Using `principal.id` from technical user token as `owner_id` | Always use a real human user's `userId` from `search_users` |

## Reference Files (Progressive Disclosure)

Load these files **only when needed** for specific workflow steps:

| File | Load When | Contains |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `references/API-REFERENCE.md` | Creating calculations (Step 6) | API endpoints, CalculationDto |
| `references/TEMPLATES.md` | Generating code (Step 5) | Ready-to-use calculation templates |
| `references/LEANIX-MODEL.md` | Understanding field types | Fact sheet types, relations, field access |
| `references/NAMING-CONVENTION.md` | Standardizing names | Naming convention |
| `references/ANALYSIS-RULES.md` | Analyzing calculations | Code analysis rules, workspace checks |

---

## Workflow

### Step 0: Determine Intent

**First, check if the user's message already expresses clear intent.** If it does, skip `AskUserQuestion` and branch directly:

| If the user's message contains… | Branch to |
|----------------------------------|-----------|
| "what can", "what does", "capabilities", "help me", "do for me" | [Understand Capabilities] |
| "create", "build", "new calculation", "add a calculation" | [Create New Calculation] |
| "debug", "fix", "error", "not working", "broken" | [Debug Failing Calculation] |
| "list", "manage", "show", "audit", "analyze", "existing" | [Manage Workspace Calculations] |

**Only ask if intent is genuinely ambiguous.** Use `AskUserQuestion`:

**IMPORTANT: `AskUserQuestion` supports 2–4 options only.** When there are more than 4 choices, list all options as a numbered list in plain text and ask the user to type their selection instead.

**What do you need help with?**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Create new calculation** | Build a new calculated field |
| **Debug failing calculation** | Diagnose and fix a calculation that's not working |
| **Understand capabilities** | Learn what calculations can do |
| **Manage workspace calculations** | Query, analyze, fix, or reorganize existing calculations |

Branch to the appropriate workflow based on response.

---

### Step 0.1: Verify Calculations Toolset

**Run immediately after determining intent (before any other MCP call):**

Call `mcp__leanix__list_calculations()`. This is a lightweight check that confirms the `calculations` toolset is active.

**If the call succeeds:** Continue to the next step silently (no message needed).

**If the tool is not found / not available:**

The `calculations` toolset is **optional and hidden by default**. Display this message to the user:

> **Calculation tools are not available.** Your MCP connection is missing the `calculations` toolset.
>
> Fix: Add `?toolsets=inventory,calculations,custom_reports` to your MCP server URL.
>
> **Claude Code (OAuth):**
> ```
> claude mcp remove leanix
> claude mcp add --transport http leanix "https://mcp.leanix.net/services/mcp-server/v1/mcp?toolsets=inventory,calculations,custom_reports"
> ```
>
> **Claude Code (.mcp.json):** Change the URL to:
> ```
> https://{SUBDOMAIN}.leanix.net/services/mcp-server/v1/mcp?toolsets=inventory,calculations
> ```
>
> After updating, restart Claude Code and re-invoke the `calculations-toolkit` skill.

Then **stop the workflow** — do not continue without calculation tools, as creation will fail.

**If MCP is not connected at all** (no `mcp__leanix__*` tools available):

> **No LeanIX MCP connection detected.** This skill requires the LeanIX MCP server.
>
> Quickest setup:
> ```
> claude mcp add --transport http leanix "https://mcp.leanix.net/services/mcp-server/v1/mcp?toolsets=inventory,calculations,custom_reports"
> ```
>
> See [MCP Setup](../../MCP-SETUP.md) for full instructions.

## [Create New Calculation] Workflow

### Step 1: Workspace Context (Automatic)

MCP handles authentication and workspace connection automatically. No credential extraction or token exchange needed.

**Verify connection:**
1. Call `mcp__leanix__list_calculations()` to confirm workspace access (already done in Step 0.1).

**Display:** `Connected to LeanIX workspace - Ready to create calculations.`

**Fallback:** If MCP not configured, offer to set up MCP.

---

### Step 1.5: Discover Workspace Data Model

> **CRITICAL:** Do NOT assume standard fact sheet types, fields, or relations exist.
> Every workspace has custom configurations. ALWAYS discover before proceeding.

**Fact sheet types** are enumerated in the `create_calculation` tool schema — no discovery call needed.

**Discover field keys, relation names, and enum values** using the GraphQL SDL:

```
Step 1: mcp__leanix__list_graphql_types(filter="{FactSheetType}")
        → finds type names e.g. "Application", "ApplicationToBusinessCapabilityRelation"

Step 2: mcp__leanix__get_graphql_type_definitions(["Application", "ApplicationToBusinessCapabilityRelation"])
        → returns SDL with all fields, relations, and enum values
```

The SDL response gives you:
- All fields with their types (e.g., `functionalSuitability: ApplicationFunctionalSuitability`)
- All relations and what they connect (e.g., `relApplicationToBusinessCapability: ApplicationToBusinessCapabilityRelationConnection`)
- All enum values for Single Select fields

**Extract and store from the SDL:**

| Data | Use |
|------|-----|
| Field names and types | Present as target field options in Step 2 |
| Relation names | Present as source data options in Step 3 |
| Enum values | Validate return type for Single Select targets |

**Display to user:**

```
Found fact sheet types in your workspace.
Which fact sheet type should this calculation target?
```

**Why this step is mandatory:**
- Workspaces have custom fields beyond the standard set
- Relation names depend on how the workspace was configured
- Enum options for Single Select fields are workspace-specific
- Using wrong names causes `configurationErrorCount` errors

**Store the data model** for use in subsequent steps - do not re-query.

---

### Step 2: Identify Target Field

> **Use data model from Step 1.5** - Do not ask for free-text field names.

**Present fact sheet types from data model:**

> **IMPORTANT: `AskUserQuestion` supports 2–4 options only.** When there are more than 4 choices (e.g., fact sheet types), do NOT use `AskUserQuestion`. Instead, list all options as a numbered list in plain text and ask the user to type their choice. Wait for the user's text reply before proceeding.

**After user selects fact sheet type, present fields from data model:**

```
Tool: AskUserQuestion

"Which field should this calculation populate?"

Options: [Custom fields from data model for selected type]
         [Show field types: Double, Integer, String, Single Select, etc.]
```

> **If the target field doesn't exist yet:** The field must be created in the LeanIX UI before a calculation can populate it.
>
> **How to create a custom field:**
> 1. Go to the fact sheet configuration page and select the subsection where you want the field
> 2. Click **Add field**
> 3. Configure the field parameters in the right-side panel
> 4. Review and save the changes
>
> Full documentation: [Fact Sheet Fields – SAP Help](https://help.sap.com/docs/leanix/ea/fact-sheet-fields?q=create+custom+field)

**Ask calculation type:**

```
Tool: AskUserQuestion

"Where is the target field located?"

Options:
- "On the fact sheet itself" → type: fact-sheet
- "On a relation" → type: relation
```

**For relation type calculations:**
- Present relations from data model (not hardcoded list)
- Note that data access will be `data.factSheet.fieldName`

**Important constraints:**
- Base fields (built-in) cannot be targets
- Each field can only have ONE calculation
- Cannot read target field as source (prevents loops)

### Step 3: Identify Source Data

> **Use data model from Step 1.5** - Present actual fields and relations from the workspace.

**Present source options based on calculation type:**

For **fact-sheet** calculations, present:
1. **Fields on the fact sheet** - From data model for selected type
2. **Relations** - From data model, show relation names
3. **Lifecycle** - `data.lifecycle.currentPhase`

For **relation** calculations, present:
1. **Fields on related fact sheet** - `data.factSheet.fieldName`
2. **Lifecycle of related fact sheet** - `data.factSheet.lifecycle.currentPhase`

**Data Access Reference:**

| Source Type                           | Fact-Sheet Calc | Relation Calc |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Same fact sheet field**             | `data.fieldName` | N/A |
| **Related fact sheet field**          | N/A | `data.factSheet.fieldName` |
| **Lifecycle**                         | `data.lifecycle.currentPhase` | `data.factSheet.lifecycle.currentPhase` |
| **Relations**                         | `data.{relationName}` | N/A |
| **Related FS field via relation**     | `data.{relationName}[i].factsheet.{field}` | N/A |
| **Relation attribute**                | `data.{relationName}[i].{attributeName}` | N/A |
| **NA fields** (not applicable fields) | `data.naFields` — `string[]` of field keys | `data.factSheet.naFields` |

> **Note:** Replace `{relationName}`, `{field}`, `{attributeName}` with actual names from data model.

**Key insight:** Relations return arrays directly!

---

### Step 3.5: Validate Configuration

> **Before generating code**, verify all names exist in the data model.

**Validation Checklist:**

| Check | How | Error If Failed |
|-------|-----|-----------------|
| Target field exists | Look up in data model | `affected_field_key not found` |
| Target field is writable | Not a base field | `Target attribute is read-only` |
| Target field type known | From data model | Wrong return type |
| **If target is Single/Multi Select: fetch enum values** | `get_graphql_type_definitions(["{EnumTypeName}"])` — enum type name is the field's GraphQL type from SDL | Returning an invalid enum string silently clears the field — no error thrown |
| Source fields exist | Look up in data model | `configurationErrorCount` errors |
| Relations exist | Look up in data model | `undefined` at runtime |

**Display configuration summary:**

```
Configuration Summary:
- Fact Sheet Type: {type} ✓ (exists in workspace)
- Target Field: {field} ✓ (type: {fieldType})
- Source Data: {sources} ✓ (validated)
- Calculation Type: {fact-sheet|relation}

Proceed with code generation?
```

**If validation fails:**
- Show which names are incorrect
- Suggest closest matches from data model
- Do NOT proceed until corrected

---

### Step 4: Define Calculation Logic

Based on the goal, determine the calculation pattern:

| Goal | Pattern | Template |
|------|---------|----------|
| Count relations | `data.rel.length` | Template 1 |
| Sum numeric field | `reduce((a,b) => a+b, 0)` | Template 2 |
| Average | Sum / length | Template 3 |
| Min/Max | `Math.min/max(...values)` | Template 4 |
| Derive status | Map value to enum | Template 5-7 |
| Days until date | Date difference | Template 8 |
| Concatenate strings | Template literals | Template 9 |
| Collect unique values | `new Set()` | Template 10 |
| Conditional | If-then-else | Template 11 |
| Scoring | Weighted calculation | Template 12 |
| Completeness | Check required fields | Template 13 |
| Default values | Null coalescing | Template 14 |

→ **For templates:** Load `references/TEMPLATES.md`

### Step 5: Generate Calculation Code

**Critical Rules Checklist:**
- [ ] NO imports - only `data` available
- [ ] NO `async/await` - must be synchronous
- [ ] NO `fetch()` - no API calls allowed
- [ ] MUST read at least one `data.*` field (API rejects otherwise)
- [ ] Use `export function main()` (never async)
- [ ] Return single value matching target field type
- [ ] Return `null` to clear field, `undefined` for no change
- [ ] Add inline comments explaining non-obvious logic (e.g. why a fallback value is used, what a condition guards against)

**Fact Sheet Calculation Template:**
```javascript
/**
 * [CALCULATION NAME]
 * Type: fact-sheet
 * Fact Sheet: [TYPE]
 * Target Field: [FIELD] ([TYPE])
 * Logic: [DESCRIPTION]
 */

export function main() {
  // Guard: return null to clear the field if required source data is missing
  if (!data.someRequiredField) return null;

  // [Explain non-obvious logic, e.g. why a fallback value is used]
  const value = data.someField ?? 0;

  // [Explain what this condition guards against]
  if (data.someRelation.length === 0) return null;

  return value;
}
```

**Relation Calculation Template:**
```javascript
/**
 * [CALCULATION NAME]
 * Type: relation
 * Fact Sheet: [TYPE]
 * Relation: [RELATION_NAME]
 * Target Field: [FIELD] ([TYPE])
 * Logic: [DESCRIPTION]
 */

export function main() {
  // Guard: no value to compute if source field is unset on the related fact sheet
  const sourceValue = data.factSheet.someField;
  if (sourceValue == null) return null;

  // [Explain distribution logic, weighting, or other non-obvious computation]
  const count = data.factSheet.someRelation.length;

  // Avoid division by zero when no related items exist
  if (count === 0) return null;

  return sourceValue / count;
}
```

### Step 5.5: Test Run

> **RECOMMENDED:** Test calculation code against real data before creating it.

The test-run executes your code in a sandbox against a real fact sheet without creating or modifying any calculation. Use it to:
- **Validate logic** - Confirm the code returns expected values
- **Test edge cases** - Verify null/empty handling across different fact sheets

**For fact-sheet calculations:**

1. Find a sample fact sheet to test against:
   ```
   Tool: mcp__leanix__text_to_fact_sheets
   Parameters: { "text": "{FactSheetType} fact sheets" }
   ```

2. Run the test:
   ```
   Tool: mcp__leanix__test_run_calculation
   Parameters:
     type: "fact-sheet"
     code: "export function main() { ... }"
     affected_field_key: "targetFieldName"
     affected_fact_sheet_type: "Application"
     affected_fact_sheet_id: "{UUID from step 1}"
   ```

**For relation calculations:**

A relation calculation runs against a specific edge between two fact sheets. Identify the edge by passing the **source** and **target** fact sheet UUIDs along with the relation name — the MCP server resolves the underlying relation instance automatically.

1. Find a sample source fact sheet:
   ```
   Tool: mcp__leanix__text_to_fact_sheets
   Parameters: { "text": "{FactSheetType} fact sheets" }
   ```

2. Inspect its relations to pick a target fact sheet on the other side of the edge:
   ```
   Tool: mcp__leanix__get_fact_sheet_details
   Parameters: { "fact_sheet_ids": ["{sourceUUID}"], "fact_sheet_type": "Application" }
   ```
   In the response, look at `<relationName>.edges[*].node.factSheet.id` — pick one of those as your target UUID.

3. Run the test:
   ```
   Tool: mcp__leanix__test_run_calculation
   Parameters:
     type: "relation"
     code: "export function main() { ... }"
     affected_field_key: "targetFieldName"
     affected_relation_name: "relApplicationToBusinessCapability"
     affected_from_fact_sheet_id: "{sourceUUID}"
     affected_to_fact_sheet_id: "{targetUUID}"
   ```

> **Alternative:** If you already have a relation instance UUID (e.g., from the LeanIX UI), pass it as `affected_relation_id` instead of the from/to pair.

**Interpreting results:**

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `success: true` | Code ran and result is valid for the target field |
| `success: false` | Code ran but result is invalid (wrong type, etc.) |
| `result` | The actual return value from the code |
| `data` | The executor input — inspect to understand what `data.*` contains |

**Debugging tips:**
- Inspect `executorInput.data` in the test-run response to see available fields
- Test with fact sheets that have different data (empty relations, missing fields)
- If `success: false`, check that return type matches target field type

**Proceed to creation only when:**
- [ ] Test returns `success: true`
- [ ] Result value is the expected value
- [ ] No unexpected `null`/`undefined` returns on edge-case fact sheets

---

### Step 5.7: Select Calculation Owner

Every calculation requires an `owner_id` — the LeanIX user who owns the calculation in the workspace. **The owner must be a real human user**, not a technical user.

**Ask the user using `AskUserQuestion`:**

> "Who should own this calculation?"

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Assign me as owner** | Look up the current user's email and use their `userId` |
| **Search for another user** | Look up a different user by name or email |

**If the user picks "Assign me as owner":**
- Ask for their email if not already known
- Run `mcp__leanix__search_users(email="...")`
- Use the `userId` field (NOT `id`) from the result as `owner_id`

**If the user picks "Search for another user":**
- Ask: "What's the user's name or email?"
- Run `mcp__leanix__search_users(query="...")` (or `email="..."`)
- If multiple matches, present them via `AskUserQuestion` and let the user pick
- Use the `userId` field (NOT `id`) from the chosen result as `owner_id`

> **Validation:** Verify `displayName` resolves to a real human (not blank, "? ?", or "null null"). If it doesn't, the result is likely a technical user — search again.

---

### Step 5.8: Confirm Before Creating

Present the final calculation to the user before creating it:

```
**Calculation ready to create:**

- **Name:** {name}
- **Type:** {fact-sheet | relation}
- **Fact Sheet Type:** {type}
- **Target Field:** {affectedFieldKey}
- **Owner:** {displayName}

**Code:**
```javascript
{code}
```
```

Then ask using `AskUserQuestion`:

**"Create this calculation?"**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Create** | Proceed with creation |
| **Edit code** | Go back and modify the code |
| **Cancel** | Abort |

Only proceed to Step 6 if the user confirms.

---

### Step 6: Create Calculation

Use the MCP tool to create the calculation. The `owner_id` was selected in Step 5.7.

**Fact-sheet calculation:**
```
Tool: mcp__leanix__create_calculation
Parameters:
  name: "Calculation Name"
  description: "What it calculates"
  type: "fact-sheet"
  affected_fact_sheet_type: "Application"
  affected_field_key: "fieldName"
  code: "export function main() { ... }"
  status: "inactive"
  owner_id: "{USER_UUID from Step 5.7}"
```

**Relation calculation:**
```
Tool: mcp__leanix__create_calculation
Parameters:
  name: "Calculation Name"
  description: "What it calculates"
  type: "relation"
  affected_fact_sheet_type: "Application"
  affected_relation_name: "relApplicationToBusinessContext"
  affected_field_key: "fieldName"
  code: "export function main() { ... }"
  status: "inactive"
  owner_id: "{USER_UUID from Step 5.7}"
```

**Success:** Report the calculation ID and URL: `https://{INSTANCE}.leanix.net/{WORKSPACE}/admin/calculations/{id}`

> **Deriving INSTANCE and WORKSPACE:** If unknown, call `mcp__leanix__text_to_fact_sheets` with any query (e.g. `"Application"`) and extract the base URL from any fact sheet's `url` field — it will be in the form `https://{INSTANCE}.leanix.net/{WORKSPACE}/...`. All calculation URLs share the same base; only the `{id}` segment changes per calculation.

→ **For creation details:** Load `references/API-REFERENCE.md`

### Step 7: Enable Calculation

> **Rule:** Source fields (data.*) are extracted from the calculation code **only when it is enabled**, not when saved as inactive.

Ask the user using `AskUserQuestion`:

**"The calculation was created as inactive. Enable it now?"**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Enable now** | Activate the calculation so it starts computing values |
| **Keep inactive** | Leave it inactive for manual review first |

If the user chooses **Enable now**, call:
```
Tool: mcp__leanix__enable_calculation
Parameters: { "id": "{calculation UUID from Step 6}" }
```

### Step 6.5: Verify Creation

After creating the calculation, verify it works correctly:

1. **Check creation succeeded**
   - Confirm calculation appears in LeanIX Admin → Calculations
   - Verify target field and fact sheet type are correct
   - Check `invalid` is not `true`

2. **Review calculated values**
   - Activate the calculation and check field values on sample fact sheets in the UI
   - Verify results match expected values

3. **Review for edge cases**
   Before marking complete, consider:
   - What happens if source data is null/empty?
   - Does the return type match the target field type?
   - What if relations have zero items?
   - Can this calculation be simpler?

Ask: "Would you like me to review edge cases before we finalize?"

### Step 7: Ask for Refinements

Offer:
- Test the calculation
- Add edge case handling
- Create related calculations

## [Debug Failing Calculation] Workflow

### Step 1: Collect Information

Request: calculation code, error message (if any), expected vs actual behavior, calculation type.

### Step 2: Automated Diagnostic Checks

| Check | Issue | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `async` keyword | Calculation is async | Remove async - must be synchronous |
| `await` keyword | Using await | Remove - no async operations |
| `fetch` | API call attempted | Remove - not allowed in calculations |
| `import` | Import statement | Remove - no imports allowed |
| Export syntax | Missing `export` | Use `export function main()` |
| Return type | Returning object | Return single value |
| Data access (fact-sheet) | Using `data.factSheet` | Use `data.field` directly |
| Data access (relation) | Using `data.field` | Use `data.factSheet.field` |

### Step 3: Check Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `invalid: true` | Syntax error in code | Check JS syntax |
| High `errorCount` | Runtime errors | Check null handling |
| High `configurationErrorCount` | Bad field/relation names | Verify against data model |
| No updates happening | Returning `undefined` | Return actual value or `null` |
| Wrong value type | Type mismatch | Return correct type for field |

### Step 4: Provide Diagnosis

Generate diagnostic report with issues found and recommended fixes.

### Step 5: Offer Corrected Code

Ask if user wants fully corrected calculation code generated.

**Target field limitations:**
- Base fields (built-in) cannot be targets
- Each field can have only ONE calculation
- Cannot create circular dependencies

## [Manage Workspace Calculations] Workflow

Use this workflow to query, analyze, fix, or reorganize existing calculations.

### Step 1: Connect to Workspace

Reuse workspace connection from "Create New Calculation" Step 1.

### Step 2: Discover Data Model

> **CRITICAL:** Query data model BEFORE fetching calculations to enable validation.

```
Tool: mcp__leanix__get_fact_sheet_types
```

Then inspect a sample fact sheet for each type of interest:

```
Tool: mcp__leanix__text_to_fact_sheets
Parameters: { "text": "{FactSheetType} fact sheets" }

Tool: mcp__leanix__get_fact_sheet_details
Parameters: { "fact_sheet_ids": ["{UUID}"], "fact_sheet_type": "{Type}" }
```

Store the data model for validation in subsequent steps.

### Step 3: Fetch All Calculations

```
Tool: mcp__leanix__list_calculations
```

Returns all calculations in the workspace with their metadata, status, and error counts.

> **Display rule:** Never surface raw API response metadata (`hasNextPage`, `nextCursor`, pagination counts) to the user. Only present calculation data itself.

### Step 4: Analyze Calculations

For each calculation, **validate against data model**:

| Check | Field | Issue If |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Naming convention | `name` | Doesn't follow pattern |
| Description | `description` | Empty or generic |
| Code quality | `code` | Contains debug statements, etc. |
| Target field exists | `affectedFieldKey` | Not in data model |
| Has errors | `errorCount` | > 0 |
| Has config errors | `configurationErrorCount` | > 0 |
| Has owner | `ownerId` | null |
| Is active | `status` | "inactive" when should be active |

**Report categories:**
- **Critical:** High error counts, invalid calculations
- **Warning:** Missing owners, empty descriptions
- **Info:** Naming convention suggestions

### Step 5: Fix Issues (Validating Against Data Model)

For each issue found:

**Update name/description/code:**
```
Tool: mcp__leanix__update_calculation
Parameters:
  id: "{UUID}"
  name: "New Name"           (optional)
  description: "New desc"    (optional)
  code: "..."                (optional)
```

**Set owner (lookup user ID first via MCP):**
```
Tool: mcp__leanix__search_users
Parameters: { "query": "user name or email" }
```
Use the `userId` field (not `id`) from the result, then:
```
Tool: mcp__leanix__update_calculation
Parameters:
  id: "{UUID}"
  owner_id: "{USER_UUID}"
```

**Enable/disable a calculation:**
```
Tool: mcp__leanix__enable_calculation
Parameters: { "id": "{UUID}" }

Tool: mcp__leanix__disable_calculation
Parameters: { "id": "{UUID}" }
```

### Step 6: Reorganize

**Delete unused/obsolete calculations:**
```
Tool: mcp__leanix__delete_calculation
Parameters: { "id": "{UUID}" }
```

**Create new calculations as needed:**
Follow the "Create New Calculation" workflow.

### Step 7: Present Report

Summarize:
- Total calculations analyzed
- Issues found by category
- Actions taken
- Recommendations for manual review

## Quick Reference

**Data Access Patterns:**

```javascript
// FACT-SHEET CALCULATIONS (type: "fact-sheet")
// Target: field on the fact sheet itself
data.fieldName                    // Direct field access
data.lifecycle.currentPhase       // Lifecycle phase ("plan", "phaseIn", "active", "phaseOut", "endOfLife")
data.naFields                     // string[] of field keys intentionally left blank (NA)
data.relationName                 // Relation array
data.relationName[0].factsheet    // Related fact sheet
data.relationName[0].factsheet.fieldName  // Field on related FS

// RELATION CALCULATIONS (type: "relation")
// Target: field on a relation
data.factSheet.fieldName          // Related fact sheet's field
data.factSheet.lifecycle.currentPhase  // Related fact sheet's lifecycle
data.factSheet.naFields           // NA fields on the related fact sheet
```

**Return Values:**
```javascript
return 42;                     // Number
return "text";                 // String
return "option1";              // Single select
return ["opt1", "opt2"];       // Multi-select
return null;                   // Clear field
return undefined;              // No change (AVOID - usually indicates bug)
```

## MCP Integration Points

### Discover Data Model

Use the GraphQL schema tools to discover workspace configuration:

```
Step 1: List available fact sheet types
Tool: mcp__leanix__list_graphql_types
Parameters: { "filter": "{FactSheetType}" }

Step 2: Fetch SDL for the relevant types
Tool: mcp__leanix__get_graphql_type_definitions
Parameters: { "type_names": ["{FactSheetType}", "{RelationType}"] }
```

Returns SDL with all fields, relations, and enum values for each type.

### Calculations CRUD

```
mcp__leanix__list_calculations         - List all calculations
mcp__leanix__get_calculation           - Get single calculation by ID
mcp__leanix__create_calculation        - Create new calculation
mcp__leanix__update_calculation        - Update existing calculation
mcp__leanix__delete_calculation        - Delete calculation
mcp__leanix__enable_calculation        - Set status to active
mcp__leanix__disable_calculation       - Set status to inactive
mcp__leanix__test_run_calculation      - Test code against a fact sheet/relation without saving
```

### Search Users
```
Tool: mcp__leanix__search_users
Use: Get owner ID for new calculations (use userId field, not id)
Parameters: { "email": "user@example.com" }
```
