name: kestral-setup
description: Use when the user explicitly runs Kestral setup, asks to onboard, organize, or import work into Kestral, or wants to create a Kestral project with a Project Brain from connected tools, goals, repos, documents, or optional local files.
---

# Setup

Help the user set up a **Kestral project with a Project Brain** — a living summary of their work for themselves, their
coding agents, and their team. Setup inspects connected tools and user-stated goals, proposes projects, imports context,
and generates brains they can work from immediately. Local files only when the user offers them.

## Prerequisites

**Kestral** must show as **connected** with tools such as `whoami`, `execute_operation`, or `entity_lookup` in this
session. If missing, reconnect in the client.

## Human-readable references

Keep Kestral IDs internal unless the user asks for them. In user-facing output:

- Tasks: show `slug - title` when a slug is available, linked with `url` when the host can render links.
- Projects, documents, feedback, customers, tags, statuses, and other Kestral entities: show the readable
  name/title/label first, linked with `url` when the host can render links.
- People and actors: show display names; if unresolved, write `Unknown member (id: <rawId>)`.
- Unknown non-member entities: write `Unknown <entity type> (id: <rawId>)`.
- Approval tables and write-back plans must put the human-readable label first. Raw URLs, machine IDs, source IDs, and
  bare slugs belong only in secondary metadata when useful.
- Use existing display fields first; do extra lookups only for entities that matter to the answer.

## Workflow

### 0. Preflight

Run before any Kestral MCP call. Stop on failure; exact messages in `docs/manifest-copy-spec.md`.

**Kestral tools (all hosts)** — Confirm Kestral tools such as `whoami`, `execute_operation`, or `entity_lookup` in this
thread (`/mcp`). If absent → **MCP not connected**. Give the user the matching troubleshooting steps:

- **Claude Code Desktop / Claude Cowork:** Open **Customize → Kestral plugin → Connectors**, click **Install** on
  Kestral, then click **Add**. Once connected, run `/kestral:kestral-setup` again.
- **Claude Code CLI:** Open settings (gear icon or `/config`), go to **MCP Servers**, add or reconnect the **Kestral**
  server, then run `/kestral:kestral-setup` again.
- **Cursor:** Open **Settings → MCP Servers**, add or reconnect the **Kestral** MCP server, then retry.
- **Codex:** Open **Settings → MCP Servers**, add or reconnect the **Kestral** MCP server, then run `$kestral-setup` in
  a **new thread**.

Do not block setup if upload tools are missing. Step 7 handles upload attempts gracefully — trying the best available
tool, offering egress fix instructions on failure, and falling back to summarization via `create_document` for text
files. Project creation, task import, and external doc linking work regardless of upload capability.

**Auth failure signals:** HTTP 401, `unauthorized`, or tool error `Not authenticated` (MCP v2 returns
`{"error":"Not authenticated"}` — no `401` in the message). When any call returns one of these, the OAuth token has
expired or the connection dropped. Guide the user to re-authenticate through their host's UI (same troubleshooting steps
as "MCP not connected" above) and stop.

**Host capability detection:** Check what document upload operations are available in this session:

- `upload_document` present → local Go bridge; can read and upload files from disk directly
- `upload_request_urls` available via `execute_operation` → remote MCP; can upload via presigned URLs if the host has
  shell/curl access and egress to `app.kestral.ai`
- Neither present → `create_document` only; can create documents from inline content or agent-authored summaries

Also check whether the agent has filesystem access (Read tool, Shell tool) — hosts like Claude Desktop and Cowork
typically do not, even when the user shares files via the chat `+` button (the agent gets the content in conversation
context, not a file path on disk). This affects whether `scan-folder` and file-path-based upload are usable.

### 1. Existing project detection

After Preflight confirms tools are present, call `execute_operation("search_projects", { query: "all projects" })` to
see whether the workspace already has projects.

| Condition   | Behavior                                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No projects | Continue to step 2 (connected-sources opener).                                        |
| 1+ projects | Run the **prioritized work snapshot** (below), then show the three next-step options. |

#### Prioritized work snapshot (when projects exist)

Before asking what the user wants to do, give them a **prioritized look at their work** — do not jump straight to
"create a new project?" or source collection.

Run in parallel when the host supports it:

1. **`execute_operation("get_daily_brief", {})`** — personal summary of what changed across projects (urgent items,
   blockers, stale work, project mentions). If the brief is generating, say so briefly and continue with project brains.
2. **`entity_lookup({ type: "project_brain", id: "<projectId>" })`** for the **top 2–3 projects** to highlight:
   - Prefer projects named or prioritized in the daily brief.
   - Otherwise pick the most recently updated projects from the `search_projects` result list.
   - Keep each brain digest to **2–3 bullets** (goals, blockers, recent changes) — do not dump full brain text.
   - If `brainGenerationStatus` is `queued` or `running`, say the brain is building (~1–2 min).
   - If no brain exists, note it and link the project URL — do not block the flow.

Render compactly, then show the three options:

> I found [N] Kestral projects in your workspace, each with a **Project Brain** that stays in sync as you and your
> agents work.
>
> **Your prioritized work**
>
> *[2–4 bullets from `get_daily_brief` — what changed, what's urgent, what needs attention today]*
>
> **From your Project Brains**
>
> 1. [Project Name](project-url)
>    - *[2–3 bullets from brain: goals, blockers, recent changes — or "Brain building…" / "No brain yet"]*
> 2. ... …and [N] more projects. *(when 4+ total)*
>
> **You can get started right now:**
>
> - **Pick a task from above** and start working — I can set it in progress and help here
> - **Plan your day** — run `/kestral:plan-day` (or `$kestral-plan-day` in Codex) for a prioritized plan across all your
>   projects
>
> **Or set up more:**
>
> - **Add more context** to a project — pull new docs or tasks from connected apps and refresh the brain
> - **Create a new project** — set up a Kestral project with a brain from Linear, Jira, Notion, Drive, Granola, or other
>   connected apps

Do not ask for sources or a manifest until the user picks **Add more context** or **Create a new project**.

**Routing:**

| User choice                   | Next step                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pick a task / start working   | Help them start (set task in progress, outline steps). Introduce Sync + plan-day + end-day if not yet mentioned.       |
| Plan my day / explore         | Enter the **explore and work** flow (below).                                                                           |
| Add more context to [project] | Enter the **enrich existing project** flow (below). Skip step 2 opener; frame around "what new context should we add?" |
| Create a new project          | Continue to step 2 (connected-sources opener). Frame as setting up a new Kestral project with a brain.                 |

#### Explore and work flow

When the user wants to explore existing projects rather than create or enrich:

1. If the **prioritized work snapshot** (step 1) already ran, do not repeat the full project list — confirm which
   project to focus on, or pick the top project from the brief/brain highlights if the user says "just help me get
   started."
2. Otherwise share project links and brain highlights (same pattern as step 1).
3. Suggest visiting the Project Brain link, then **plan your day** — invoke `kestral-plan-day/SKILL.md` or tell the user
   to run **`/kestral:plan-day`** (Claude Code / Cowork) or **`$kestral-plan-day`** (Codex). Pull daily brief, calendar,
   and task state for prioritized work; help them pick a task from the plan.
4. After plan-day (or once they start a task), introduce the **ongoing skills** (suggest, do not auto-run):

   > **Skills that keep your project in sync** (you only set these up once):
   >
   > - **Plan day** — `/kestral:plan-day` or `$kestral-plan-day` — morning prioritization from your brief, calendar, and
   >   tasks (what you just ran, or rerun anytime).
   > - **Kestral Sync** — `/kestral:sync` or `$kestral-sync` for a manual sync; for automatic updates, install the
   >   ambient sync rule once (`kestral-sync/README.md` — paste the snippet into `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`). After
   >   that, progress comments, status changes, and PR links flow back on push and phase completion — you don't need to
   >   keep saying "kestral sync."
   > - **End day review** — `/kestral:end-day-review` or `$kestral-end-day-review` — when you wrap up, reconciles what
   >   got done, updates task status in the project, and sets tomorrow's priorities.

5. Stay focused on the project — suggest adding context only when the user asks.

#### Enrich existing project flow

When the user picks an existing project to enrich:

1. Store the selected project's `projectId` and `url` — do **not** call the `create_project` operation.
2. Open with: "What new context should we add to [Project Name]? Point me at connected apps — Linear, Jira, Notion,
   Drive, Granola notes, local files/folders — or describe what changed."
3. Run steps 3–6 (inventory, infer workstreams, manifest, checkpoint) scoped to **additions only** — new docs, tasks, or
   links for that project. The manifest may be a single-project "add to existing" view rather than multi-project
   creation.
4. In step 7, skip the `create_project` operation. Upload/link documents and create tasks against the existing
   `projectId`. Call `execute_operation("trigger_brain_build", { projectId })` after new context is attached.
5. Continue to step 8 (results) and step 9 (guided journey).

If the user cancels during enrich, follow the same cancel behavior as the main flow.

### 2. Frame context sources (connected-first)

#### What setup delivers (say this explicitly)

Before asking for sources, frame what they're building toward — it explains **why** sources matter.

> **What you'll get:** A **Kestral project with a Project Brain** — a living, AI-generated summary of your work that:
>
> - Gives **you** prioritized context when you start your day
> - Gives **your coding agents** the same shared understanding (via Kestral MCP)
> - Keeps **your team** aligned without status meetings — the brain updates as tasks, docs, and progress change
>
> The apps and docs you point me at (Linear, Jira, Notion, Drive, Granola, etc.) **feed that brain**. I'll create a
> Kestral project, import the most relevant tasks and documents, and generate a Project Brain you can work from
> immediately — for yourself, your agents, and your team.

#### Output format

Use **plain conversational prose** — ask questions in normal sentences and let the user reply in chat. Avoid rendering
setup as a card grid, source tiles, button panels, labeled form fields, or other custom UI that the host doesn't
natively support.

#### Local files

Setup leads with connected tools and goals. Local files are just another source the user can mention — handle them via
`kestral-scan-folder/SKILL.md` when they do. Use words like "include" or "add" rather than "scan" in user-facing copy.

**Two roles for local files:** Files may be (a) context for the agent to understand the user's work and propose
projects, or (b) documents the user wants uploaded into Kestral for the brain and team. Many files are only the first —
rough drafts, explorations, scratch notes help the agent understand the work but don't belong in a shared workspace.
Default to reading files for context. At the manifest checkpoint, surface which files could be uploaded and let the user
decide.

**When the host lacks filesystem access** (Claude Desktop, Cowork — detected in preflight), do not ask for file paths.
If the user shares files via the chat UI (`+` button), work with the content provided. If they want to include local
files that the agent can't access, explain: "I can't read files from your machine directly. You can share them in chat,
or upload them at [project URL] after setup."

**Uploaded files are one-time snapshots.** They do not sync back to the local filesystem. If the user edits the local
file, Kestral won't see the change. For live-synced documents, suggest storing originals in a connected tool (Google
Drive, Notion) and linking them instead.

#### 2a. Surface what's available

After auth (and any existing-project routing), inspect what source tools are loaded in this session — task systems
(Linear, Jira, GitHub Issues, Asana, …), document systems (Notion, Google Drive, Confluence, Slack), Granola, and other
MCP connectors. Use that inventory to tailor the opener; do not interrogate the user source-by-source.

Open with this framing (adapt connector names to what's actually loaded). Lead with **what they'll get**, then ask for
sources:

> Welcome to Kestral. I'll help you set up a **Kestral project with a Project Brain** — a living summary of your work
> that you, your coding agents, and your team can work from immediately. It stays in sync as tasks, docs, and progress
> change.
>
> **Where does your context live?** The sources you name become the project's foundation and feed the brain. For
> example: a Linear project, Jira board, Notion or Google Drive docs, Confluence pages, Slack threads, Granola notes,
> local files/folders, or describe a goal.
>
> Example: "Use my Linear Auth project and matching Drive docs" or "I'm launching billing automation — pull Jira and
> Notion."

If connectors are loaded, mention them briefly once (e.g. "I see Linear and Google Drive connected here — say which to
use, or describe your goal and I'll pick signals."). If none besides Kestral are loaded, skip the inventory line and
focus on goals; the user can still paste content or add integrations later.

If the user doesn't have existing context in any app — just an idea or goal — that's enough. Help them refine it into a
project description, create the project, and seed a document with their notes so the brain has something to work from.
They can always add more context later.

Accept any useful source input:

- User buckets: explicit project names, goals, work areas, teams, or outcomes the user wants to organize around.
- Connected task systems such as Linear, Jira, GitHub Issues, Asana, ClickUp, or Shortcut.
- Connected document systems such as Notion, Google Drive, Slack, Confluence, Granola, and other linkable sources.
- Repositories or repo links.
- Files or folders the user mentions.

Use lightweight steering prompts when they fit:

> Want me to use your task system as the main signal, or do you already have buckets in mind?

> I found active work in Linear and GitHub, plus docs in Drive. I'll use those unless you want to limit scope.

> I can create the recommended projects, just the top few, or let you rename/split/merge first.

> This is a curated first pass. I'll import the most relevant context now and leave the rest available to add later.

For read-only source inspection, tell the user what is being checked and proceed — one mention of connected sources is
enough.

### 3. Inventory sources

Inspect independent sources in parallel when possible. Dispatch sub-agents for independent source families when the host
supports it; otherwise use parallel tool calls for independent reads. Keep sub-agent outputs compact: source name,
candidate workstreams, task metadata, document titles/paths/URLs/IDs, confidence notes, and failures. Do not load huge
task or document bodies into main context when metadata, paths, URLs, or IDs are enough.

Use these source-specific helpers and patterns:

| Source family    | Guidance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User buckets     | Treat user-provided project names, goals, work areas, and outcomes as the taxonomy unless the user asks you to infer alternatives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Task systems     | Use `kestral-scan-tasks/SKILL.md` for Linear, Jira, GitHub Issues, and similar tools. Prefer open, in-progress, recently updated, high-priority, or recently completed work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Document systems | Use `execute_operation("link_external_document", ...)` for sources with recognized URLs (Notion, Google Drive, Slack, Confluence). For other document sources like Granola, pull the content via MCP and use `execute_operation("create_document", ...)`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Repositories     | Use repo metadata, issue links, README/docs references, milestones, labels, and recent activity to support task and document signals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Local files      | User-initiated. Use `kestral-scan-folder/SKILL.md` when the user provides a folder or file paths and the host has filesystem access. Treat files as **context first** — inspect representative content to understand the user's work and inform project proposals. Do not assume every file should be uploaded; surface uploadable files at the manifest checkpoint and let the user decide which belong in the shared workspace. When the host lacks filesystem access, work with content the user shares in conversation. |

If the user scoped sources, honor that scope. If they only said they are not organized yet, inspect available connected
task and document sources, then propose a focused starting structure.

If a connected source read fails, mark that source skipped and continue with the other sources. If all usable sources
are missing or unreadable, ask one targeted question that would unblock setup.

### 4. Infer active workstreams

Default to active workstreams, not archive categories or source-system silos.

Documents are flexible evidence. A document may be:

- A source to inspect so the agent can understand the user's work and propose an organization.
- A local upload or external link to attach to a Kestral project.
- **Inline text** pasted in chat (Slack thread, summary, notes) — discern the role: (a) substantive evidence the team
  should reference → attach with `create_document` and `projectId`; (b) context that describes the work scope → weaving
  into project description and tasks is fine; (c) organization instructions (how to split, naming rules) → follow them
  without creating a document. Do NOT use `link_external_document` for pasted text — there is no canonical URL to link.
- Both evidence and project context when it is useful for Project Brain.

For a small document set, inspect enough content to understand the work at a high level before proposing projects. For a
large document set, sample representative documents, summarize coverage, and let the user steer expansion. If only
filename, path, metadata, or a failed extraction is available, say that clearly and do not present filename-only guesses
as if the contents were understood. Ask one focused question only when the evidence is too thin or risky for a useful
manifest.

Taxonomy rules:

- User-provided buckets take precedence. Map available tasks and documents into those buckets first.
- Task systems are the strongest inferred signal because they encode projects, epics, milestones, labels, boards,
  assignees, status, priority, and recency.
- Documents support, refine, or challenge the task structure. Use doc titles, folder names, links, sampled content, and
  recency to attach evidence or reveal missing workstreams.
- If task and document signals disagree, anchor on active tasks and note the ambiguity in the manifest.
- Avoid creating projects for stale, purely historical, or low-evidence themes unless the user explicitly asks.

#### Functional domain detection

When the user's work spans distinct **functional domains** — such as product development, go-to-market, fundraising,
operations, customer success, or infrastructure — propose a separate project for each domain, even when they relate to
the same company, product, or initiative. A single company is not a single project when the work functions are distinct.

**Test:** Would each domain benefit from its own Project Brain with different goals, blockers, and next steps? If yes,
they should be separate projects. A Product Brain and a Fundraising Brain serve different purposes; combining them
produces a grab-bag that helps nobody.

This applies regardless of the input source. A single flat list from the user, a single conversation, a single folder,
or a single task system can feed multiple projects when the work naturally separates into distinct domains.

#### Project count

Let the number of projects reflect the natural shape of the work — do not anchor on a specific count. If 1 project is
right, propose 1. If 5 are clearly distinct, propose 5. The user can always merge, split, or rename projects at the
manifest checkpoint (step 6).

Guidelines:

- Start by identifying the distinct workstreams from the evidence. Each workstream with its own goals and success
  criteria is a candidate project.
- If signal is weak or the evidence is ambiguous, ask one targeted question before creating projects.
- Show any lower-confidence candidates as "extra candidates to revisit later" in the manifest rather than forcing them
  into projects prematurely.

Default import is curated, not capped. Select the most relevant representative tasks and documents for the first pass.
If the user asks for more or all matching tasks/documents, import more or all in batches within the approved projects.

### 5. Render a multi-project manifest

Use readable labels throughout the manifest: document names, source labels, task titles, and priority labels. External
task IDs are provenance/debug details only; do not show them unless the user asks.

Show proposed Kestral projects, not a source dump. Each proposed project includes:

- Title and short description.
- Rationale: task project, label, epic, milestone, board, recent activity, repeated document theme, or user bucket.
- Selected tasks grouped by source, with priority/status annotations when available.
- Documents separated by action — only show categories that have items:
  - **Files to upload** — local files that will be uploaded to Kestral as-is (when upload tools are available).
  - **Documents to link** — external docs (Notion, Drive, Slack, Confluence) linked via `link_external_document`.
  - **Documents to summarize** — content the agent will read and create summary documents from (when upload isn't
    available, or for pasted/inline content).
- Coverage counts, such as "12 tasks selected, 43 more matching" or "8 docs selected, 96 more candidates."
- Confidence and ambiguity notes, such as "High confidence from Linear project and matching Drive docs."

If any source files were **skipped or unsupported**, show them after the project list with the reason:

```md
Skipped

- pitch-deck.pptx — unsupported file type (.pptx)
- design-mockup.fig — unsupported file type (.fig)
- node_modules/ — excluded directory
```

Only show the skipped section when there are skipped items. Do not invent hypothetical missing inputs.

Render compactly:

```md
Proposed projects

1. Billing Automation Description: Consolidates active billing workflow work and supporting implementation docs.
   Rationale: Linear project, recent GitHub issues, and matching Drive design docs. Tasks:
   - Fix invoice retry state [linear, high]
   - Add webhook replay tests [github, medium] Files to upload:
   - billing-architecture.md [local, 4.2 KB] Documents to link:
   - Billing rollout notes [google-drive] Coverage: 12 tasks selected, 43 more matching. Confidence: High. Ambiguity:
     one Slack thread may belong to Support Ops.

Skipped

- quarterly-review.pptx — unsupported file type (.pptx)

Extra candidates to revisit later

- Legacy billing cleanup: stale tasks and low recent activity.
```

Make clear that the curated manifest is a starting import, not a hard limit:

> This is a curated first pass. I'll import the most relevant context now and leave the rest available to add later.

### 6. Manifest checkpoint

After rendering the manifest, prompt the user to approve or adjust. Lead with the default action (create), then note
they can change how work is grouped into projects:

> Ready to create these projects? Say "create these" to proceed, or tell me how you'd like them grouped differently — I
> can split, merge, rename projects, or add and remove items before creating anything.

This gives a clear default ("create these") while making adjustment easy. If the user says nothing (or the host
auto-approves tool calls), proceed to step 7. If they ask to change something, apply the edit and re-render.

Do not block on a separate manifest approval when the host already prompts for write-tool permission (Claude Code,
Claude Cowork, Cursor, Codex with tool permissions enabled).

Supported commands mirror `docs/manifest-copy-spec.md`. If an edit target is ambiguous in a multi-project manifest, ask
one focused clarification before applying it:

| Command or intent                                   | Effect                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ok` / `yes` / `go` / `create these`                | Proceed to create selected projects and import selected context                   |
| `revise`                                            | Edit the manifest before proceeding (same as edit commands below)                 |
| `remove <file>`                                     | Remove a specific local file from the selected document list                      |
| `add <path>`                                        | Validate the path, stat its byte size, and add it to the selected local documents |
| `remove <source> documents`                         | Remove all selected documents from a source, such as Notion or Google Drive       |
| `skip tasks`                                        | Remove selected tasks from this run so no tasks are imported                      |
| `title: <new>` / `change title <new>`               | Override a proposed project title; ask if the target project is unclear           |
| `description: <new>` / `change description <new>`   | Override a proposed project description; ask if the target project is unclear     |
| `only create <project>`                             | Deselect other proposed projects                                                  |
| `skip <project>`                                    | Remove a proposed project from this run                                           |
| `rename <project> to <new title>`                   | Update a proposed project title                                                   |
| `split <project>`                                   | Ask one focused follow-up and split into clearer workstreams                      |
| `merge <project A> and <project B>`                 | Combine proposed projects and their selected context                              |
| `move <item> to <project>`                          | Move a selected task or document between proposed projects                        |
| `use these buckets: <list>`                         | Switch to user-led taxonomy and remap sources                                     |
| `import more <source> into <project>`               | Expand import scope for that project/source                                       |
| `import all matching <tasks/documents>`             | Switch that project/source to bulk import mode                                    |
| `look at <folder> instead` / `change folder <path>` | Switch to a different local folder and remap the proposed taxonomy                |
| `cancel` / `no` / `stop`                            | Exit cleanly without Kestral write calls                                          |

Re-render the manifest after edits. The host's tool-permission prompt is the approval gate for normal curated setup.

**Hosts without per-tool permission prompts** (agents that auto-run MCP writes with no confirmation): wait for explicit
`ok` / `create these` before calling any write MCP tool. Ask: "Okay to proceed? ok/revise/cancel"

Ask for explicit confirmation and wait before writes when:

- The user requests a large bulk import.
- The run would create more than 5 projects.
- The scope is ambiguous or risky enough that a mistaken import would be hard to unwind.
- The host does not provide per-tool permission prompts.

For large writes, confirm scope in one concise message, such as:

> This will import 437 tasks and 82 documents into 3 projects. Okay to proceed? ok/revise/cancel

### 7. Apply selected projects and imports

Apply each selected project after the manifest checkpoint (or after explicit ok for no-permission hosts). Use parallel
write calls only where writes are independent and the host allows it; otherwise proceed sequentially with compact
progress updates. Always preserve successful project URLs.

For each selected project:

1. Call `execute_operation("create_project", { title, description })` with lifecycle status when appropriate. Store
   `projectId` and `url`.
2. Upload or create selected documents for **this project** using the strategy below.
3. Link selected external documents with `execute_operation("link_external_document", { url, title, projectId })`.
4. Create selected tasks with `execute_operation("create_tasks_batch", { projectId, tasks })`.
5. Trigger `execute_operation("trigger_brain_build", { projectId })` for that project.

When multiple projects are proposed, allocate documents to the project they belong to — do not dump all documents into
one project. A competitive analysis belongs to the GTM project, not the product project.

#### Document handling strategy

Documents come from three sources. Handle each differently:

**Local files the user wants uploaded:**

1. **Try upload first.** Use `upload_document` or `execute_operation("upload_request_urls", ...)` per
   `kestral-upload/SKILL.md`. Supported file types: PDF, DOCX, TXT, Markdown, CSV, images (JPEG/PNG/WebP/HEIC), audio
   (MP3/M4A), video (MP4).
2. **If upload fails** (egress blocked, tools unavailable, host limitations), tell the user and offer to summarize
   instead: "I can't upload this file directly from here. I can read it and create a summary document for the brain."
3. **When summarizing**, read the file content, produce a focused summary, and call
   `execute_operation("create_document", { title, content, projectId })`. Do not copy file contents verbatim — summarize
   so the brain gets useful context without raw data dumps. Be transparent: "I created a summary of [filename] — the
   original file isn't stored in Kestral."
4. **Binary files the agent can't read** (images, audio, video) when upload isn't available: note them in the results.
5. **Files that couldn't be uploaded or summarized:** After project creation, mention that these files can be uploaded
   manually from the project's Documents tab — if they are a supported file type. Before project creation (no URL yet),
   don't reference a project URL that doesn't exist; instead note the files in the manifest's Skipped section so the
   user sees them, and mention the manual upload option in the post-creation results (step 8) once the project URL is
   available.

Report upload failures per-file; do not pre-declare hard limits. Skip rejected files and continue.

**User-shared content** (pasted text, inline notes, conversation context):

Discern intent before choosing a strategy:

- Rich evidence the team should reference (meeting notes, detailed threads) →
  `execute_operation("create_document", { title, content, projectId })`
- Work scope and context → incorporate into project description and tasks
- Organization instructions → follow them to shape the project structure

When content covers multiple domains, allocate to the appropriate project — either as a document per project or absorbed
into each project's description. Do NOT create one large cross-project synthesis document. Do NOT use
`link_external_document` for pasted text — there is no canonical URL to link.

**External documents** (Notion, Drive, Slack, Confluence):

- Use `execute_operation("link_external_document", { url, title, projectId, content? })` for documents with canonical
  source URLs. Prefer linking over reproducing content via `create_document` — linked docs keep provenance and support
  autosync.
- Track `resolutionStatus`. A `pending` result is partial success: the snapshot is linked, but the matching Kestral
  integration should be connected for live autosync.

Tasks:

- Use `execute_operation("create_tasks_batch", { projectId, tasks })` with the selected task records.
- Preserve source labels in task descriptions or metadata when available.
- For bulk task imports, batch by source and project, summarize progress, and continue on item-level failures when safe.

Project Brain:

- Call `execute_operation("trigger_brain_build", { projectId })` per project after documents and tasks are attached.
- Brain failures do not invalidate project creation or imported context.

### 8. Present results

Return a compact summary:

- Successful project titles and URLs.
- Documents linked/uploaded per project, including pending external links.
- Tasks created per project and source.
- Project Brain status per project.
- Skipped sources and item or batch failures.

Present created projects, linked documents, uploaded documents, and imported tasks by readable title/name and URL when
available.

Always return successful project URLs when any project creation succeeded, even if imports or Project Brain failed.

If one or more linked docs returned `resolutionStatus: "pending"`, add one line naming the distinct sources and pointing
the user to connect them in Kestral:

> I linked your Notion and Google Drive docs from saved snapshots. Connect those integrations in Kestral (**Workspace
> Settings → Integrations**) and they'll autosync to the latest version.

If brain generation was enqueued, say:

> Your **Kestral project** is created and the **Project Brain** is generating — usually ready in **30 seconds to 2
> minutes**. [Project Name](project-url)
>
> **Next: start working from the brain.** Once it's ready, I'll pull **blockers and next steps** from your Project Brain
> here so you can pick one and get started — you don't need to leave the chat.
>
> Say **"brain's ready"** or **"what should I work on?"** when you want me to fetch it, or I can check in a moment if
> you'd like.

Then **always** continue to the **Start from Project Brain** prompt below — do not end the message after import/brain
status alone (e.g. do not stop after listing due-date mappings without a next-step ask).

#### Start from Project Brain (required after create or enrich)

After reporting creation/enrichment results, walk the user into immediate work. Each beat is a suggestion — do not
auto-run writes without approval, but **do** proactively offer to pull the brain.

1. **When brain may be ready:** Call `entity_lookup({ type: "project_brain", id: "<projectId>" })`.
   - If `brainGenerationStatus` is `queued` or `running`, tell the user it's still building and offer to retry when they
     say "brain's ready" (or retry once after ~30s if the host supports waiting).
   - If a summary exists, extract **blockers**, **next steps**, and **urgent/open work** — keep to 3–5 bullets, not the
     full brain dump.
2. **Present and ask:**

   > **From your Project Brain — here's what to tackle:**
   >
   > - *[blocker or next step 1]*
   > - *[blocker or next step 2]*
   > - ...
   >
   > **You can start right now:** pick one and I can set it **in progress** and help you work it here. **Or:** run
   > `/kestral:plan-day` for a full prioritized plan across your projects.

3. If the brain is empty or still building and the project has imported tasks, fall back to open/high-priority tasks via
   `execute_operation("list_tasks_by_status", { statusFilter: ["todo", "in_progress"], projectId })` — still ask which
   to start on.
4. After the user picks work, help them start (set task in progress, outline first steps).

   **GitHub integration nudge (coding tasks only):** If the task the user picked is code-related (mentions code, a repo,
   a branch, PR, implementation, engineering, etc.), call `execute_operation("list_integrations", {})` and check the
   GitHub entry. If `connected` is false, suggest connecting it — the response includes a workspace-scoped `deepLink`
   URL:

   > **Connect GitHub** so **Kestral Sync** can link PRs to this task and post progress as you push — your Project Brain
   > and team stay current automatically as you code: [Connect GitHub](deepLink-from-response)
   >
   > You can still work without it — Sync will post progress comments, but PR linking needs the GitHub integration.

   If GitHub is already connected, skip the nudge entirely. Then mention Sync briefly (set up once) and continue to step
   9 for plan-day / end-day skills if not yet introduced.

If multiple projects were created or enriched, run this flow for the primary project first (or ask which project to
focus on), then offer the others.

If Project Brain is not enabled:

> Project created. Project Brain isn't enabled for this workspace — ask your admin to turn it on, then open the project
> and click Generate.

If Project Brain fails:

> Project created. Brain generation couldn't start. Open the project and click Generate to retry.

### 9. Guided onboarding journey

After step 8 (including **Start from Project Brain**), walk the user through ongoing skills if they haven't started a
task yet. Each beat is a **suggestion** — never auto-run the next skill. Present in order; user can skip any beat.

#### 9a. Explore Project Brain (if not already pulled in step 8)

> Open [Project Name](project-url) to see the full brain, or ask me to **pull blockers and next steps** here anytime.

If blockers were not yet fetched, run `entity_lookup({ type: "project_brain", id })` and ask which item to start on.

When you're back from the project page, run **`/kestral:plan-day`** (or `$kestral-plan-day` in Codex) for broader day
prioritization across projects.

If the user came from **explore and work** (step 1) with no new imports, skip re-listing projects — focus on plan-day
and ongoing skills from the snapshot already shown.

#### 9b. Plan My Day

> Run **`/kestral:plan-day`** (Claude/Cowork) or **`$kestral-plan-day`** (Codex) — it pulls your daily brief, calendar,
> and task state into a realistic plan with focus blocks. Pick a task from the plan and start work.

#### 9c. Kestral Sync (set up once)

> To keep your project and Project Brain updated as you work, set up **Kestral Sync** once — see
> `kestral-sync/README.md` and paste the ambient snippet into your project's `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` (Codex/Claude)
> or install the Cursor rule. After that, progress comments, status changes, and PR links flow back automatically on
> push and phase completion — you don't need to keep invoking sync. Use **`/kestral:sync`** or **`$kestral-sync`** only
> when you want a manual "sync now."

#### 9d. End day review

> When you wrap up, run **`/kestral:end-day-review`** (Claude/Cowork) or **`$kestral-end-day-review`** (Codex). It
> reviews what got done, updates task status in your project, reconciles project state, and sets tomorrow's priorities.

#### 9e. Start working

> Pick a task from your plan and get started. With Sync set up, your Project Brain stays current for you, your agents,
> and your team in real time.

#### Follow-up (when the user asks to keep going)

| User intent                           | Do this                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Brain's ready / what should I work on | `entity_lookup` project_brain → surface blockers & next steps → ask which to start                                                |
| Start a task                          | Help the user pick a task, set it to in progress, and begin working. Point to plan-day and Sync if not yet introduced.            |
| Set up ongoing sync                   | Walk through `kestral-sync/README.md` ambient install — one-time setup, then automatic updates without repeated sync invocations. |
| End the day                           | Suggest `/kestral:end-day-review` or `$kestral-end-day-review` for status reconciliation.                                         |
| Add more context                      | Link or attach new sources, attach them to the relevant project, and rerun `trigger_brain_build`.                                 |
| Help clear blockers                   | Use Kestral task tools to inspect open project work and help the user pick the next blocker.                                      |
| Map remaining candidates              | Return to extra candidate workstreams and ask one targeted question if the next split is unclear.                                 |

## Speed and Context Rules

- Use sub-agents and parallel tool calls for independent source reads and import prep.
- Keep sub-agent outputs compact — metadata, paths, URLs, and IDs are usually enough.
- Show the manifest and proceed; the host's tool-permission prompt is the write approval gate. Ask explicit confirmation
  only for large bulk imports, 5+ projects, ambiguous scope, or hosts without per-tool prompts.

## Cancel Behavior

Before any write MCP tool has been called, `cancel` or `stop` exits cleanly. Confirm:

> Cancelled. No changes were made in Kestral.

After project creation or import writes have started, cancellation means stop future writes as soon as safely possible.
Return a compact partial-results summary with:

- Projects already created, including successful project URLs.
- Documents already uploaded or linked.
- Tasks already created.
- Project Brain calls already started or skipped.
- Any selected projects, documents, or tasks not attempted because cancellation stopped the run.

## Error and Failure Handling

- Auth/MCP failure → stop before writes; reconnect and retry.
- Upload failure (egress) → give platform-specific egress fix steps; if user can't fix, fall back to `create_document`.
- No upload tools → text/markdown via `create_document`; binary files skipped with manual-upload message.
- Source read failure → skip that source, continue with others.
- Project creation failure → skip imports for that project, continue with others.
- Partial import failure → always return successful project URLs alongside failures.
- Brain failures → non-fatal; report and continue.
- Cancellation → stop future writes; summarize what completed.

## Error Message Reference

Use `docs/manifest-copy-spec.md` for exact user-facing copy: preflight messages, error principles, partial-success
examples, and pending-link nudges. Adapt project counts, source names, item counts, and URLs to the actual run.
