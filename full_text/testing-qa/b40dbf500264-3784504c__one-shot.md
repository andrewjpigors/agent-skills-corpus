# One-Shot — Ticket to Merged PR in a Single Pipeline

Take a small task from a ticket (or plain description) — or, **without arguments**, the current in-progress goal — all the way through to a merged PR and a clean local checkout, by chaining the existing hero skills in order. This is the orchestrator for **Pipeline 2** in `PIPELINES.md`.

> **Scope guard:** one-shot is for small, low-risk PRs only. If, during planning, the change looks larger than a single focused diff (multiple subsystems, schema changes, breaking API changes, anything you would normally split into a stack), STOP after the `plan` step and tell the user to fall back to running the individual skills. Do NOT push a large PR through unattended automation.

## Pipeline DAG

```
plan → implement → test → simplify → push → self-review → mark-ready → await-review → respond → ship
```

Print this line at the start of every step, marking progress:

```
[N/10] (✓) plan → (✓) implement → (▶) test → ( ) simplify → ( ) push → ( ) self-review → ( ) mark-ready → ( ) await-review → ( ) respond → ( ) ship

Now running: test
```

When a step is skipped (e.g., `await-review`/`respond` if the repo has no review bot configured), use `(–)` and continue. When the user declines a gate (mark-ready, merge) or `test-changes` flags a UI smoke regression, use `(✗)` and stop.

### Step → skill mapping

Each DAG node delegates to a single skill (or runs inline when the work is just a poll / a user gate). Run any of these standalone when you don't want the whole pipeline:

| # | Step | Skill to run standalone |
|---|------|-------------------------|
| 1 | `plan` | inline (Plan Mode; fetches a Linear issue if `$ARGUMENTS` is an issue ID) |
| 2 | `implement` | inline (Plan Mode → edits) |
| 3 | `test` | `hero-skills:test-changes` (includes UI smoke) |
| 4 | `simplify` | `/simplify` (external skill) |
| 5 | `push` | `hero-skills:push-pr` (commits + pushes a draft PR) |
| 6 | `self-review` | `hero-skills:review-pr --no-mark-ready` |
| 7 | `mark-ready` | `hero-skills:review-pr`'s own Step 9 gate, or `gh pr ready` |
| 8 | `await-review` | inline poll (no separate skill) |
| 9 | `respond` | `hero-skills:respond-to-comments` |
| 10 | `ship` | `hero-skills:ship-pr` |

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` — Optional. An issue ID (e.g., `PROJ-123`), fetched via the Linear MCP, or a plain-text description of the task, plus optional additional context.
  - **With arguments** — start work on that ticket/description; on a feature branch with work in flight, arguments are additional context (see Step 0.5's "Default for non-default branches").
  - **Without arguments** — finish the **current goal**: Step 0.5 detects the in-progress state and resumes the pipeline from the inferred step, through `ship`'s merge and reset to the default branch. Step 0.5's decision table is the single source of truth for that routing — states with nothing left to resume exit with a hint or diagnostic per the table, and a truly fresh start on the default branch reaches Step 1, which asks what to plan.

## Prerequisites

- **GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated with the `repo` scope**. Steps 5 (push), 6 (self-review), 9 (respond), and 10 (ship) all fail without it. Install via `brew install gh` (macOS), `sudo apt install gh` (Debian/Ubuntu), or <https://cli.github.com/>. Authenticate with `gh auth login -s repo`.
- `HERO.md` exists (run `hero-skills:init-hero` first if not)
- `.github/workflows/auto-approve.yml` is on the default branch (Step 10 needs it). If missing, run `hero-skills:init-hero --update` to install it (Step 6a of init-hero handles this), then merge that workflow file to the default branch before running one-shot.
- **`pr-review-toolkit` plugin installed** so Step 6 (`self-review`) gets all five review agents. From inside Claude Code: `/plugin install pr-review-toolkit`. From a shell: `claude plugins add pr-review-toolkit@claude-plugins-official`. Without it, `hero-skills:review-pr` runs with a thinner review.
- **Playwright MCP server registered** so Step 3 (`test`) can drive the dev server for UI smoke. Requires Node.js 18+. Run `claude mcp add playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest` (add `--scope user` to share across projects, `--scope project` to commit it). Backend-only PRs skip the UI-smoke portion of Step 3 with `(–)` even without this.
- The task is small — see scope guard above

## Cross-step contract

Every chained skill in this orchestrator can fail in the middle of a long
session. Before deciding to advance to the next step, you MUST:

1. Read the child skill's reported state — last bash exit code, the verdict
   it printed, and any "STOP" / "Stopped:" lines. Do NOT infer success from
   the absence of an error.
2. Echo a one-line "Step N result:" summary to the user with what just
   happened and what you intend to do next.
3. If the child skill stopped, render the pipeline DAG with `(✗)` on the
   failed node and a `Stopped: REASON` line per `PIPELINES.md`, then halt.
   Never auto-advance past a `(✗)`.
4. **DAG state preservation.** Every "Render DAG with X active" instruction
   below means: render the line with steps before `RESUME_STEP` marked `(✓)`
   only when Step 0.5 inferred `RESUME_STEP` from a state that genuinely
   completed those steps in a prior session. For a fresh-start invocation
   (`RESUME_STEP=1`), prior-step markers are absent. The current step is
   `(▶)`; later steps are `( )` until they run; skipped steps are `(–)`;
   failed/declined steps are `(✗)`.

Apply this contract at every Step 1–10 transition below (or every transition from `RESUME_STEP` onward when resuming).

## Instructions

### Step 0: Load Hero Configuration and Confirm Scope

```bash
ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)
cat "$ROOT/HERO.md" 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_HERO_CONFIG"

# Stale-HERO check — fast subset of the plugin's check-hero-staleness.sh.
# Keep aligned with the copies in push-pr/test-changes.
HERO_TIME=$(git -C "$ROOT" log -1 --format=%ct -- HERO.md 2>/dev/null | grep -E '^[0-9]+$' || echo 0)
CONFIG_TIME=$(git -C "$ROOT" log -1 --format=%ct -- \
  pyproject.toml ':(glob)**/pyproject.toml' \
  package.json ':(glob)**/package.json' \
  go.mod ':(glob)**/go.mod' \
  Cargo.toml ':(glob)**/Cargo.toml' \
  .github/workflows .pre-commit-config.yaml \
  CLAUDE.md Makefile justfile Taskfile.yml 2>/dev/null | grep -E '^[0-9]+$' || echo 0)
if [ "${CONFIG_TIME:-0}" -gt "${HERO_TIME:-0}" ]; then
  echo "note: HERO.md may be out of date — run hero-skills:init-hero --update to refresh."
fi
```

If `HERO.md` is missing, STOP and tell the user to run `hero-skills:init-hero` first. one-shot relies on every downstream skill having a config to read; running blind through 10 steps is unsafe.

### Step 0.3: Pre-flight Checks

Before auto-branching or any other destructive work, run the full pre-flight to catch failures that would otherwise only surface at Step 5 (push), Step 6 (self-review), or Step 10 (ship) — after you've already done the work.

```bash
# DEFAULT_BRANCH is needed *here* — Step 0.4 sets it too, but the
# committed-diff lookup below runs before Step 0.4 in a fresh shell.
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(awk -F': ' '/^- default-branch:/ {print $2; exit}' "$ROOT/HERO.md" 2>/dev/null | xargs)
DEFAULT_BRANCH=${DEFAULT_BRANCH:-main}

PREFLIGHT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$ROOT/.claude/plugins/hero-skills}/scripts/preflight.sh"
[ -x "$PREFLIGHT" ] || PREFLIGHT="$ROOT/.claude/plugins/hero-skills/scripts/preflight.sh"
[ -x "$PREFLIGHT" ] || PREFLIGHT="$HOME/.claude/plugins/hero-skills/scripts/preflight.sh"

# Scope runtime checks to the projects touched by the diff (uncommitted +
# committed-but-unpushed). On a truly fresh start (default branch, clean
# tree, nothing ahead) there's nothing to runtime-check yet — skip the
# bucket entirely; Step 1 will re-run preflight with proper scope once
# files start changing.
CHANGED_PATHS=$( { git -C "$ROOT" diff --name-only HEAD 2>/dev/null;
                   git -C "$ROOT" diff --name-only "origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH...HEAD" 2>/dev/null;
                 } | awk -F/ 'NF > 1 {print $1}' | sort -u | paste -sd, -)

if [ -z "$CHANGED_PATHS" ] \
   && [ "$(git -C "$ROOT" branch --show-current)" = "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" ] \
   && [ -z "$(git -C "$ROOT" status --porcelain)" ]; then
  "$PREFLIGHT" --bucket tooling
  RC1=$?
  "$PREFLIGHT" --bucket repo
  RC2=$?
  "$PREFLIGHT" --bucket pipeline
  RC3=$?
  PREFLIGHT_RC=$(( RC1 | RC2 | RC3 ))
else
  PROJECT_ARGS=()
  [ -n "$CHANGED_PATHS" ] && PROJECT_ARGS=(--projects "$CHANGED_PATHS")
  "$PREFLIGHT" --bucket all "${PROJECT_ARGS[@]}"
  PREFLIGHT_RC=$?
fi
```

If `PREFLIGHT_RC` is non-zero, **STOP**. Print the recommended fix from each `[BLOCKER]` line (the script prints these inline) and do not advance to Step 0.4 — every blocker is something that would have failed a later step on a half-finished branch.

If `PREFLIGHT_RC` is zero but the script printed `[WARN]` lines, surface them to the user once and continue. Warnings are advisory — the user can choose to fix them or proceed.

### Step 0.4: Auto-branch off Default Branch (if needed)

one-shot never works on the default branch. If we're on it with any uncommitted files or unpushed local commits, branch off automatically — **no prompt** — so the rest of the pipeline has a feature branch to commit and push to. This runs before resume detection so Step 0.5 sees a feature-branch state whenever there is work to preserve.

First, **derive `SUGGESTED_BRANCH` as a reasoning step** per the Naming rules below — this is a model task, not a shell function. Inspect `$ARGUMENTS` (and the diff if `$ARGUMENTS` is empty) and produce a concrete, non-empty branch name. Then run the snippet below with that value exported in the environment. The snippet asserts the variable is set; it will not invent one.

```bash
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(awk -F': ' '/^- default-branch:/ {print $2; exit}' "$ROOT/HERO.md" 2>/dev/null | xargs)
DEFAULT_BRANCH=${DEFAULT_BRANCH:-main}
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Fetch origin so AHEAD reflects current remote state. Step 0.5 below does its
# own fetch — that one is the canonical FETCH_OK source for resume-detection
# guards; this fetch is for AHEAD freshness. Both are intentional and read the
# same origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH ref; the second call is a no-op when the first
# succeeded.
git fetch origin "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" >/dev/null 2>&1 || true

UNCOMMITTED=$(git status --porcelain | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
AHEAD=$(git rev-list --count "origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH..HEAD" 2>/dev/null | grep -E '^[0-9]+$' || echo 0)

if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" ] && { [ "${UNCOMMITTED:-0}" -gt 0 ] || [ "${AHEAD:-0}" -gt 0 ]; }; then
  # Refuse to branch out of a half-resolved merge / cherry-pick / rebase —
  # `git checkout -b` would silently abort or carry conflict markers forward.
  if [ -e .git/MERGE_HEAD ] || [ -e .git/CHERRY_PICK_HEAD ] \
     || [ -d .git/rebase-merge ] || [ -d .git/rebase-apply ]; then
    echo "ERROR: a merge / cherry-pick / rebase is in progress. Resolve it, then re-run one-shot."
    exit 1
  fi

  # SUGGESTED_BRANCH must already be set by the reasoning step above. Empty
  # or unset is a hard error — `${VAR:?msg}` aborts the shell with the given
  # message rather than silently running `git checkout -b ""`.
  : "${SUGGESTED_BRANCH:?SUGGESTED_BRANCH must be derived per the Naming rules before this snippet runs.}"

  echo "On $DEFAULT_BRANCH with $UNCOMMITTED uncommitted file(s) and $AHEAD unpushed commit(s)."
  echo "Auto-branching to '$SUGGESTED_BRANCH' (one-shot never works on $DEFAULT_BRANCH)."

  if ! git checkout -b "$SUGGESTED_BRANCH"; then
    echo "ERROR: 'git checkout -b $SUGGESTED_BRANCH' failed (likely a name collision)."
    echo "       Pick a different name and re-run, or 'git checkout' the existing branch first."
    exit 1
  fi
  CURRENT_BRANCH="$SUGGESTED_BRANCH"

  # When AHEAD > 0 the local $DEFAULT_BRANCH ref still points at those commits
  # (origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH does not, until the PR merges). Surface this so
  # the user isn't surprised when they switch back later.
  if [ "${AHEAD:-0}" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo ""
    echo "Note: $AHEAD local commit(s) on $DEFAULT_BRANCH are now on $SUGGESTED_BRANCH."
    echo "The local $DEFAULT_BRANCH ref still points at those commits. After this PR"
    echo "merges, switch back and 'git pull' to align with origin."
  fi
fi
```

**Naming rules** (no prompt — derive a sensible name and proceed). Rules are checked in order; the first match wins.

1. `$ARGUMENTS` matches `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]{1,9}-[0-9]+(\s|$)` (an issue ID anchored to the start): use `PROJ-123-SLUG_FROM_REST` — slug derived from whatever follows the ID; just `PROJ-123` if nothing follows. The match must be at position 0, so `Fix CVE-2024-1234 in auth` does **not** match this rule and falls through to rule 2.
2. `$ARGUMENTS` is plain text (non-empty, no leading issue ID): use `feat/SLUG`, `fix/SLUG`, `refactor/SLUG`, `chore/SLUG`, or `docs/SLUG`, picking the prefix from verbs in the description (`add/create/implement` → feat, `fix/repair/resolve` → fix, `refactor/clean/restructure` → refactor, `update/bump/upgrade` → chore, `document/explain` → docs). Slug is lowercased, hyphenated, ≤50 chars, with filler words stripped.
3. `$ARGUMENTS` is empty: derive from the diff. Use the union of committed-but-unpushed changes (`git log origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH..HEAD --stat` plus the most recent commit's subject line) and uncommitted changes (`git diff --stat HEAD`) — picking the most-changed top-level directory and a 2–3 word summary, e.g. `feat/store-trust-tier`. The committed-and-uncommitted union matters because Step 0.4 triggers on either `AHEAD > 0` or `UNCOMMITTED > 0`; `git diff --stat HEAD` alone is empty in the committed-but-unpushed case.

Do NOT silently reset `$DEFAULT_BRANCH` after the branch — that is destructive and out of scope here. The post-checkout note inside the snippet (gated on `AHEAD > 0`) tells the user `$DEFAULT_BRANCH` still points at the local commits.

### Step 0.5: Detect Resume Point

Before doing anything destructive, read the current git/PR state and figure out where in the pipeline this invocation should pick up. Users often hit `hero-skills:one-shot` after they've already done some of the work — possibly in a previous session — and the orchestrator should never silently re-do completed steps.

```bash
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(awk -F': ' '/^- default-branch:/ {print $2; exit}' "$ROOT/HERO.md" 2>/dev/null | xargs)
DEFAULT_BRANCH=${DEFAULT_BRANCH:-main}

CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# A failed fetch silently makes AHEAD/UPSTREAM judgments wrong (offline,
# auth expired, network blip). Surface the failure rather than fall through.
FETCH_OK=true
if ! git fetch origin "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  FETCH_OK=false
  echo "WARN: 'git fetch origin $DEFAULT_BRANCH' failed — origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH may be stale."
  echo "      Resume detection will refuse rows that depend on AHEAD or remote PR state and"
  echo "      will exit with diagnostic (see 'Diagnostic exit format' below). Resolve the"
  echo "      network/auth issue and re-run, or invoke the individual skills directly."
fi

UNCOMMITTED=$(git status --porcelain | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
# AHEAD here counts commits past origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH on the *current* branch.
# Note that this re-reads the value after Step 0.4 may have switched branches:
# pre-checkout it was "local $DEFAULT_BRANCH vs origin"; post-checkout it's
# "feature branch vs origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH" — different semantics, same compare.
AHEAD=$(git rev-list --count "origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH..HEAD" 2>/dev/null | grep -E '^[0-9]+$' || echo 0)

# UNPUSHED counts commits past the branch's *upstream* (the PR's head ref),
# not past origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH. Distinct from AHEAD: a user who pushed
# once and then made local follow-up commits has AHEAD>0 AND UNPUSHED>0;
# we must push those follow-ups before any review/respond/ship step.
#
# When no upstream is configured yet (common before the first push),
# `git rev-list --count '@{u}..HEAD'` errors silently and would yield 0,
# which would route the user past Step 5 (push) and skip the
# initial push entirely. Detect that case explicitly and fall back to
# AHEAD — every commit past the default branch needs a push.
if git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name '@{u}' >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  UNPUSHED=$(git rev-list --count '@{u}..HEAD' 2>/dev/null | grep -E '^[0-9]+$' || echo 0)

```

Use the decision tree below to pick the **resume step** (1–10). Each row is the first that matches top-to-bottom; rows below the line require `PR_EXISTS=true` so empty PR_* values can't accidentally match.

| Condition | Resume at | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| `FETCH_OK=false` OR `GH_OK=false` | exit with diagnostic | resume rows depend on remote state — fix network/auth and re-run, or invoke individual skills |
| `PR_EXISTS=true` AND `PR_STATE` is `MERGED` or `CLOSED`, `UNCOMMITTED == 0`, `UNPUSHED == 0` | exit with hint | `MERGED` → done; suggest `hero-skills:reset-branch` if the local checkout still has the branch. `CLOSED` without merge → the work never landed; say so explicitly and suggest reopening the PR or starting a new branch |
| `PR_EXISTS=true` AND `PR_STATE` is `MERGED` or `CLOSED`, `UNCOMMITTED == 0`, `UNPUSHED > 0` | exit with hint | local commits exist that never reached the merged/closed PR — do NOT suggest a reset; push them to a new branch (or reopen) so the work is saved remotely first |
| `PR_EXISTS=true` AND `PR_STATE` is `MERGED` or `CLOSED`, `UNCOMMITTED > 0` | exit with hint | merged/closed PR but local edits exist — branch off `DEFAULT_BRANCH` for follow-up work |
| `CURRENT_BRANCH == DEFAULT_BRANCH` and `UNCOMMITTED == 0` and `AHEAD == 0` | Step 1 (plan) | fresh start (Step 0.4 already auto-branched if there was any work to preserve) |
| Feature branch, `UNCOMMITTED > 0` | Step 3 (test) | mid-implement; re-run test (includes UI smoke) + simplify on the latest diff before pushing. If a PR is already open and non-draft, Step 5 will push the new commit to it. |
| Feature branch, `UNCOMMITTED == 0`, `UNPUSHED > 0` | Step 5 (push) | committed but not pushed (covers both the "no PR yet" case and the "pushed-once + local follow-up" case). After push updates the PR, advance to Step 6 normally. |
| Feature branch, `UNCOMMITTED == 0`, `UNPUSHED == 0`, `PR_EXISTS=true`, `PR_IS_DRAFT == "true"`, `SELF_REVIEW_DONE == 0` | Step 6 (self-review) | PR up but never reviewed |
| Feature branch, `UNCOMMITTED == 0`, `UNPUSHED == 0`, `PR_EXISTS=true`, `PR_IS_DRAFT == "true"`, `SELF_REVIEW_DONE >= 1` | Step 7 (mark-ready) | self-review already ran on this draft — go straight to the mark-ready gate |
| Feature branch, `UNCOMMITTED == 0`, `UNPUSHED == 0`, `PR_EXISTS=true`, `PR_IS_DRAFT == "false"`, `PR_REVIEW != APPROVED`, `BOT_REPLIED=false` | Step 8 (await-review) | ready PR, no bot reply yet — Step 8's poll will wait |
| Feature branch, `UNCOMMITTED == 0`, `UNPUSHED == 0`, `PR_EXISTS=true`, `PR_IS_DRAFT == "false"`, `PR_REVIEW != APPROVED`, `BOT_REPLIED=true` | Step 9 (respond) | bot has commented, run respond-to-comments |
| Feature branch, `UNCOMMITTED == 0`, `UNPUSHED == 0`, `PR_EXISTS=true`, `PR_IS_DRAFT == "false"`, `PR_REVIEW == APPROVED` | Step 10 (ship) | go straight to auto-approve + merge |
| Feature branch, `UNCOMMITTED == 0`, `UNPUSHED == 0`, `PR_EXISTS=false`, `AHEAD == 0` | exit with hint | branch has no work — suggest a fresh `hero-skills:one-shot ISSUE_OR_DESCRIPTION` (Step 1 plans inline) |
| any other combination | exit with diagnostic | unrouted state — print the detected variables and exit; user falls back to individual skills |

**Diagnostic exit format.** When a row says "exit with diagnostic" or "exit with hint," print:

1. The detected state: `CURRENT_BRANCH`, `UNCOMMITTED`, `AHEAD`, `UNPUSHED`, `FETCH_OK`, `GH_OK`, and any non-empty `PR_*` values.
2. Which row in the table matched, paraphrased in one sentence.
3. The recommended individual skill(s) to invoke next (e.g., `hero-skills:test-changes`, `hero-skills:push-pr`, `hero-skills:review-pr`).

Then **halt the orchestrator** — do not proceed to Step 1, do not silently skip into another step.

**Default for non-default branches:** when on a feature branch, one-shot resumes that branch. `$ARGUMENTS` is treated as additional context for the in-progress work. To start a *new* ticket from `$DEFAULT_BRANCH` instead, switch back to `$DEFAULT_BRANCH` first and re-run.

**No confirmation prompt.** Announce the detected state and the inferred resume point, then proceed straight into that step. Do NOT ask the user to confirm or pick an override — broken states already exit with a diagnostic above; everything else routes deterministically.

```
hero-skills:one-shot — resuming from detected state

Branch:        feat/foo (not default)
Uncommitted:   2 files
Unpushed:      3 commits ahead of origin/main
PR:            #42 (draft, 0 reviews)

Inferred resume point: Step 6 (self-review)

[6/10] (✓) plan → (✓) implement → (✓) test → (✓) simplify → (✓) push → (▶) self-review → ( ) mark-ready → ( ) await-review → ( ) respond → ( ) ship

Reasoning: branch + unpushed commits + open draft PR + no self-review comment
yet → plan/implement/test/simplify/push are done;
running self-review next.

Hard stops (these halt the pipeline mid-flight when triggered — not asked up front):
  - Plan looks too large for a single PR (Step 1 scope check)
  - test-changes fails and the failure needs design judgment
  - test-changes flags a UI smoke regression on a changed route
  - You decline review-pr's mark-ready prompt (Step 7)
  - Auto-approve returns REQUEST_CHANGES and the fixes are non-trivial
  - You decline ship-pr's merge prompt
```

Set `RESUME_STEP` to the inferred value and run that step immediately. The Cross-step contract still applies for every step from `RESUME_STEP` onward — read each child skill's reported state before advancing.

When `RESUME_STEP > 1`, render the DAG with steps before `RESUME_STEP` marked `(✓)` so the visual model stays accurate.

> **Resume rule for Steps 1–10:** execute steps starting from `RESUME_STEP`. Earlier steps render as `(✓)` in the DAG **but are NOT re-executed** — do not re-run `test-changes`, `push-pr`, etc. for those steps. The first DAG render of the run shows `RESUME_STEP` as `(▶)`. Examples:
>
> - `RESUME_STEP=1` (fresh start) → run every step in order.
> - `RESUME_STEP=6` (resuming at self-review on an open draft PR) → skip Steps 1–5 entirely; render `[6/10] (✓) plan → (✓) implement → (✓) test → (✓) simplify → (✓) push → (▶) self-review → ( ) mark-ready → ( ) await-review → ( ) respond → ( ) ship`; start running at Step 6.
> - `RESUME_STEP=7` (resuming at mark-ready, self-review comment already present) → skip Steps 1–6; render `[7/10] (✓) plan → (✓) implement → (✓) test → (✓) simplify → (✓) push → (✓) self-review → (▶) mark-ready → ( ) await-review → ( ) respond → ( ) ship`; ask the mark-ready confirmation directly.

### Step 1: plan

Render the DAG with `plan` as the active step:

```
[1/10] (▶) plan → ( ) implement → ( ) test → ( ) simplify → ( ) push → ( ) self-review → ( ) mark-ready → ( ) await-review → ( ) respond → ( ) ship

Now running: plan
```

Plan inline — there is no standalone planning skill to delegate to; one-shot owns the full plan flow itself:

1. **Parse `$ARGUMENTS`.** If the first token matches a Linear/issue-ID pattern (e.g., `PROJ-123` — letters, dash, digits), treat it as an issue ID; otherwise treat the entire argument as a plain-text description. Any remaining text after the issue ID is additional context. If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask the user what to plan — Step 0.5 routes here only when it found no current goal on the current branch to resume (PRs on other branches are not scanned).
2. **If an issue ID was found, fetch it from Linear** using the Linear MCP tools:

   ```
   mcp__linear-server__get_issue with id: ISSUE_ID
   mcp__linear-server__list_comments with issueId: ISSUE_ID
   ```

   Extract and summarize the title, description, acceptance criteria, labels/priority, and any related/linked issues, plus comments for extra context. Present the summary to the user. If no Linear MCP is configured or the ID does not resolve, tell the user and fall back to treating `$ARGUMENTS` as a plain description.
3. **If a plain-text description was provided**, use it directly as the task context. Summarize what you understand the task to be and confirm with the user.
4. **Enter Plan Mode** via `EnterPlanMode`. This ensures Claude cannot modify files while planning and the user must approve the plan before implementation begins. Analyze the codebase (identify affected systems, search for related code, note existing patterns, identify dependencies), then draft an implementation plan covering summary, files to modify/create, implementation steps, testing approach, and risks. Ask clarifying questions about anything unclear before finalizing.
5. **Exit Plan Mode** via `ExitPlanMode` once the plan is ready — this hands it to the user for approval. The user either approves (Plan Mode exits, implementation begins in the same conversation) or rejects (stay in Plan Mode and revise).

**Scope check after planning.** Read the plan output. If any of the following holds, STOP and hand back to the user:

- Touches >5 files across unrelated subsystems
- Adds or changes a public API contract / DB schema / CI workflow
- Plan has an "out-of-scope follow-up" list with non-trivial items
- The user did not approve the plan in Plan Mode

Otherwise continue.

### Step 2: implement

Render DAG with `implement` active. Implement the plan inline (Plan Mode exits naturally into implementation). Follow these rules:

- **Read before edit** — Always Read a file before modifying it.
- **Match existing patterns** — Follow naming, structure, and style already in the codebase. Don't introduce new conventions.
- **One step at a time** — Announce each step briefly, make the change, then move on. No commentary between steps unless something blocks you.
- **Stop and ask on ambiguity** — If a step is unclear or the codebase state contradicts the plan, stop and ask the user rather than guess.

After implementation, **always run a quick self-review-of-the-diff before moving on** — but do NOT run the full `review-pr` agent suite yet (that happens in Step 6 against the open PR). At minimum:

- `git status` — confirm only intended files changed
- `git diff` — read every line; reject sloppy edits
- Verify the change matches the plan; flag deviations to the user

### Step 3: test

Render DAG with `test` active. Run `hero-skills:test-changes` (no arguments — runs verification plus smoke tests, including UI smoke via Playwright MCP when a UI project is detected).

If tests fail with a quick, mechanical fix (lint, typo, import order), apply the fix and re-run. If they fail in a way that needs design judgment (test asserting wrong behavior, integration breakage, flaky CI), STOP and hand back.

If `test-changes` flags a UI smoke regression — a 4xx/5xx on a changed route, an uncaught console error, a `wait_for` timeout — render `(✗) test` plus `Stopped: test-changes regression on ROUTE` and hand back. Do not advance to simplify/push; we never want a known UI regression in git history if we can help it.

On backend-only PRs (no UI project declared in HERO.md), `test-changes` reports its frontend-smoke section as skipped with `(–)` internally and continues — that's expected, not a failure. one-shot still renders the top-level `test` node as `(✓)` once it completes.

> **Resume caveat:** when one-shot resumes at Step 5 or later (test + simplify were already done in a prior session), the test result reflects the diff at *that earlier* HEAD, not the current state. Step 0.5's table forces re-entry at Step 3 whenever `UNCOMMITTED > 0`, which covers mid-implement diffs. But a resume at Step 5 (push, after a follow-up commit landed elsewhere) does *not* re-test. If you want a fresh test before pushing, invoke `hero-skills:test-changes` directly, then re-run one-shot.

The smoke portion of `test-changes` is intentionally narrow (≤5 routes, no large forms). For deeper coverage, run a real E2E suite directly.

### Step 4: simplify

Render DAG with `simplify` active. Invoke the `simplify` skill via the Skill tool — it reviews the dirty diff for reuse, quality, and efficiency and fixes any issues found before push runs.

`simplify` is **not** part of this plugin — it ships separately (see the user-invocable skills list). `hero-skills:push-pr` also invokes it internally when it commits, so running it here makes simplification visible as its own DAG step *and* the second invocation inside push-pr is a fast no-op once nothing is left to simplify.

If the `simplify` skill is unavailable in this environment, render `(–) simplify` and continue — push-pr's own commit step will catch anything we missed via its inline fallback checklist.

### Step 5: push

Render DAG with `push` active. Run `hero-skills:push-pr` (no arguments — commits any outstanding work with a smart conventional commit, branches off the default branch first if needed, pushes, and opens a draft PR). Trust its grouping/commit logic — do not skip pre-commit hooks. Capture the PR number from its output for downstream steps.

### Step 6: self-review

Render DAG with `self-review` active. Run `hero-skills:review-pr --no-mark-ready` (auto-detects your draft PR and runs the pr-review-toolkit agents in parallel, applies fixes). The `--no-mark-ready` flag is **required** here so review-pr stops before its own Step 9 mark-ready prompt — one-shot's Step 7 below owns that gate, and double-prompting would be confusing.

This step covers `review-pr` Steps 1–8 only: post the review comment, ask permission to apply fixes, apply them, push the commit, post the improvements summary, and update the PR description. Mark-ready is deliberately deferred to one-shot's Step 7 so the DAG renders it as a visible, separately-tracked node.

### Step 7: mark-ready

Render DAG with `mark-ready` active. Now ask the user the gate question explicitly:

```
Convert draft PR #{number} to ready-for-review? [y/N]
```

On `y`:

```bash
gh pr ready "$PR_NUMBER"
```

This is a **hard gate**. If the user declines, render `(✗) mark-ready` plus `Stopped: user declined mark-ready` and STOP. Do not bypass — auto-approve in Step 10 refuses draft PRs anyway, and `gh pr ready` is the only way past the draft state.

### Step 8: await-review

Render DAG with `await-review` active. If `HERO.md` declares a Code Review Agent (CodeRabbit, Greptile, Copilot review, etc.), poll the PR comments for the bot's first comment for **up to 60 seconds total, polling every 15 seconds**. If the bot has not posted by then, render `(–) await-review` (the gate behavior is delegated to Step 10's auto-approve, which will refuse on unresolved threads) and advance to Step 9 only if `BOT_REPLIED=true` — otherwise skip Step 9 with `(–)` too and go straight to Step 10.

```bash
BOT_USER=$(awk -F': ' '/^- bot-username:/ {print $2; exit}' "$ROOT/HERO.md" \
  | tr -d '[:space:]"'"'"'')
# PR_NUMBER comes from Step 5's push-pr output. Re-derive owner/repo from gh
# in case earlier steps did not export them.
PR_NUMBER=${PR_NUMBER:-$(gh pr list --head "$(git branch --show-current)" \
  --json number --jq '.[0].number')}
OWNER_REPO=$(gh repo view --json owner,name --jq '"\(.owner.login)/\(.name)"')
DEADLINE=$((SECONDS + 60))
BOT_COMMENT=""
while (( SECONDS < DEADLINE )); do
  BOT_COMMENT=$(gh api "/repos/$OWNER_REPO/issues/$PR_NUMBER/comments" \
    --jq "[.[] | select(.user.login == \"$BOT_USER\")] | first.id // empty")
  [ -n "$BOT_COMMENT" ] && break
  sleep 15
done
```

If no review bot is configured (`agent: none`), render `(–) await-review` and skip both Steps 8 and 9; advance directly to Step 10.

### Step 9: respond

Render DAG with `respond` active. Run `hero-skills:respond-to-comments` to address the bot's inline comments and resolve threads. This step only runs if Step 8 saw the bot reply.

If the bot's feedback exceeds a small set of trivial fixes, render `(✗) respond` plus `Stopped: bot feedback non-trivial — escalate to a human reviewer` per `PIPELINES.md` skip/error semantics, and halt. Do not advance to Step 10.

### Step 10: ship

Render DAG with `ship` active. Run `hero-skills:ship-pr`. This:

1. Checks the auto-approve gates (prior review present, no unresolved threads, no active CHANGES_REQUESTED, no unanswered reviewer questions).
2. Posts `@auto-approve` and waits for the verdict.
3. On APPROVE, asks before merging. The user must say `y`.
4. After merge, switches to the default branch, pulls latest, and deletes the merged head branch (remote + local).

If auto-approve returns REQUEST_CHANGES or WORKFLOW_FAILED, STOP. The user should run `hero-skills:respond-to-comments` again or fix the workflow before re-attempting.

### Final Summary

After ship-pr completes successfully, print the final pipeline DAG and a one-shot summary:

```
[10/10] (✓) plan → (✓) implement → (✓) test → (✓) simplify → (✓) push → (✓) self-review → (✓) mark-ready → (✓) await-review → (✓) respond → (✓) ship

One-Shot Summary
================
Task:        ISSUE_ID — TASK_TITLE
PR:          #PR_NUMBER — PR_TITLE
Branch:      PR_BRANCH (deleted) → DEFAULT_BRANCH
Merged:      MERGE_SHA
Duration:    HH:MM (from Step 1 start to Step 10 finish)

You're on DEFAULT_BRANCH with the merge pulled.

Next:
  hero-skills:one-shot NEXT_TICKET   # next small task
  /clear                              # fresh context first
```

If the pipeline stopped early, render the DAG with `(✗)` on the failed step, the reason, and the recommended skill to re-invoke once the blocker is cleared.

## Notes

- This skill **does not skip user gates**. Plan approval, mark-ready, merge confirmation are all explicit. Auto mode does not change that.
- This skill **does not retry** on judgment-call failures (test design, large bot feedback). Retrying without human input is how small PRs become broken merges.
- Step 0.4's `git checkout -b` is unconfirmed by design — one-shot never works on the default branch and assumes the auto-derived name is acceptable. To rename later, use `git branch -m`. The sibling skill `push-pr` prompts for the name because it's invoked deliberately on an existing branch; one-shot's auto-mode contract precludes that prompt.
- For larger work, run the same skills individually so you can pause between them.
- Run `hero-skills:reset-branch` separately if you abandon mid-pipeline — ship-pr's reset only fires after a successful merge.
