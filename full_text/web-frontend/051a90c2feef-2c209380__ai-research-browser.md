# AI Research Browser

Use this skill when the user wants Hermes to run AI chat, Deep Research, or Agent flows through an installed browser profile, especially Brave or Comet/Komet.

The helper CLI is:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py
```

## Default Intent Routing

If the user only says "Starte Deep Research", "start Deep Research", or asks
for Deep Research without naming a provider/browser, route the plan to Gemini
Deep Research in Comet first:

- browser: `comet`
- profile: `work`
- provider: `google` / `gemini`
- mode: `deep-research`
- preferred Comet live-CDP port: `9333` only when owner/profile verification proves it is Comet
- first action: `real-session-preflight` or `workflow-run` without `--submit`

Do not choose Brave, ChatGPT, sibling, clone, or a broad provider suite for this
ambiguous prompt unless the user explicitly names that target or Comet/Gemini is
blocked and an explicit fallback is allowed. If port `9333` is occupied by VS Code,
Code Helper, another browser, or any non-CDP listener, do not treat that port as
Comet and do not ask the user to use it; run restart recovery dry-run so the CLI
can allocate a free CDP port for the real Comet profile. A safe first command is:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py real-session-preflight \
  --browser comet \
  --profile work \
  --provider google \
  --port 9333 \
  --output /tmp/hermes-comet-gemini-preflight.json
```

If the preflight returns `port_collision.detected=true`, immediately produce a
safe recovery plan instead of blocking on the occupied port. If the same preflight
also reports an `attach_port` from `alternate_cdp.found=true`, use that port
directly and skip restart recovery:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py browser-cdp-recover \
  --browser comet \
  --profile work \
  --provider google \
  --port 9333 \
  --dry-run \
  --output /tmp/hermes-comet-gemini-recover.json
```

## What It Does

- Discovers installed Chromium-family browsers: Brave, Comet/Komet, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and ChatGPT Atlas.
- Reads Chromium profile metadata from `Local State` and `Preferences`, including profile directory, display name, and visible account email when available.
- Resolves profile aliases such as `work` by exact profile/account match first, then by a Work/Arbeit name match.
- Produces launch arguments for headless or background runs with `--remote-debugging-port`, `--user-data-dir`, and `--profile-directory`.
- Starts launchable browsers hidden in the background via macOS `open -g -j`, with optional true headless mode and a dry-run JSON plan before execution.
- Supports provider modes for ChatGPT chat, ChatGPT Deep Research, ChatGPT Agent, Gemini chat, Gemini Deep Research, Gemini Agent, Claude chat/research/artifacts, Perplexity research, and Grok/Grog research.
- Builds a full browser x profile x provider x feature test matrix for systematic E2E runs.
- Provides an interactive wizard that lets a human choose the installed browser, profile, provider, and feature before launching or testing.
- Archives existing provider chats into a local cache so later runs can continue from cached transcripts or intentionally refresh by scraping again.
- Reopens cached/existing chat URLs with `workflow-followup`, optionally sends a follow-up such as "Fass zusammen" only when `--submit` is present, exports Markdown, and refreshes the local cache.
- Attaches local files/images to `workflow-run` and `workflow-followup` when the provider exposes a visible file input, and records `no-file-input` instead of guessing when the upload path is hidden.
- Discovers installed SaveAI / AI Exporter extension manifests and can copy/load selected extensions into temporary profile clones for export-oriented tests.
- Reverse-engineers installed SaveAI / AI Exporter capabilities, including supported provider hosts, Markdown/PDF/JSON/image export actions, Notion sync actions, and local Notion session evidence without cookie values.
- Extracts visible provider account, plan/subscription, model, quota, and usage text when a real UI snapshot is supplied.
- Scans local profile site data for provider session evidence without reading or emitting cookie values.
- Runs a real-session preflight that checks CDP reachability, default-port ownership, already-running browsers without remote debugging, and provider session evidence before any paid workflow is claimed as usable.
- Runs Agent Browser backed E2E probes against a CDP-enabled browser profile and records provider inventory artifacts.
- Runs an Agent Browser live suite against a real CDP-enabled browser session and can fail hard when the page is signed out or blocked.
- Runs `workflow-live-run` against a real CDP-enabled background browser session, opens only a new automation tab, leaves existing tabs/windows alone, and leaves long-running Deep Research/Agent tabs open for later follow-up/export.
- Runs `workflow-sibling-run` against a persistent sibling automation profile: a separate `--user-data-dir` launched offscreen/headful with CDP, so active user windows are not closed, relaunched, or navigated.
- Fills a provider composer through Agent Browser, optionally submits the prompt, exports the visible output, and saves it into the local chat cache.
- Builds a focused primary feature suite for ChatGPT chat/model selection, ChatGPT Deep Research, ChatGPT Agent, Gemini Deep Research, Claude Opus, Grok chat/research, and Perplexity chat/research.
- Runs Agent Browser against disposable browser-profile clones and records `signed-out-or-wall` when the cloned session hits login or anti-automation pages.
- Exposes provider-specific probe hints for account menus, model selectors, tool controls, and usage/limit text.
- Lists automation backends such as Playwright/CDP, Codex Computer Use, Peekaboo, Unbrowser Local, CloakBrowser, OpenAI CUA/Operator, Claude Computer Use, Gemini Computer Use, Stagehand, Browser-Use, and Hyperbrowser.
- Lists Peter Steinberger's Oracle 0.13 as an optional consult/backend layer for multi-model review, browser-session reattach, long-running Deep Research/Agent supervision, attachment readiness, and session artifacts. `workflow-run` defaults to Oracle `assist` artifacts for long-run observability, but local guards still decide whether anything is submitted.
- Lists selectable model/tool catalogs for ChatGPT, Gemini/Google, Claude/Anthropic, Perplexity, and Grok/xAI.
- Marks profiles as `signed-in-hidden` when browser metadata indicates account/session state but no email is exposed.
- Reports `app_exists`, `binary_exists`, and `user_data_exists` so stale browser profile data is not confused with a launchable installed browser.
- Records E2E evidence as a `status.json` plus screenshot path, so a human can verify whether the provider UI actually entered the requested mode.

## Safety Rule

Do not quit or relaunch the user's already-open browser without explicit permission. If a browser is already running without `--remote-debugging-port`, run preflight and report the blocker. Prefer `launch-background --dry-run` or `launch-all-background --dry-run` before execution, so the user can see whether the run will attach, launch hidden, or be blocked. For live UI checks, use Computer Use against the existing window and record screenshots locally.

For Agent Browser "truth" checks, prefer `agent-browser-live-suite --assert-login` against a known real CDP port. Do not trust `agent-browser --auto-connect` unless the captured provider UI proves the intended profile/account is logged in; auto-connect can attach to a signed-out clone or the wrong Chromium instance.

For actual Deep Research or Agent execution in a standing background browser, prefer `workflow-live-run` or `workflow-orchestrate --live-cdp --port <port>`. These commands require `real-session-preflight.can_attach=true`; if the browser is already running without remote debugging, they report the blocker instead of closing or relaunching the user's browser.

When the running browser is not CDP-attachable and must not be closed, use `workflow-sibling-run`. It never starts a second process on the original profile directory; it seeds or reuses a dedicated sibling profile, removes only stale locks there, launches the browser offscreen/headful with a fresh CDP port, and optionally closes only that launched sibling process with `--close-after`. Treat hot-cloned provider sessions as provisional: if Google, ChatGPT, or another provider shows `Anmelden`/sign-in after clone seeding, record `signed-out-or-wall` and seed a persistent sibling profile with a real one-time login instead of claiming the workflow worked.

Use `sibling-profile-init` for that one-time setup. It opens the separate automation profile visibly so the user can complete login, DBSC/device-bound checks, consent, or provider challenges inside the sibling profile. Future `workflow-sibling-run` calls then reuse the same `--sibling-user-data` in the background.

Do not commit private screenshots that contain account names, chat history, or private prompts to a public repository. Keep them as local artifacts unless the user explicitly asks for a sanitized export.

## Commands

Discover browsers, profiles, providers, modes, and known model labels:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py discover
```

Build the full test matrix:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py matrix --json --backend playwright-cdp
```

List automation backends:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py backends
```

Build an Oracle 0.13 dry-run/reattach plan for a real CDP browser session:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py oracle-plan \
  --prompt "Review the current failed E2E browser workflow." \
  --remote-chrome 127.0.0.1:9223 \
  --research-depth deep \
  --model gpt-5.5-instant \
  --browser-attachment-timeout 240
```

For long ChatGPT/Gemini browser workflows, `workflow-run` can include Oracle evidence without bypassing local guards:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py workflow-run \
  --browser brave \
  --profile work \
  --provider chatgpt \
  --mode agent \
  --prompt "Analysiere kurz, warum Oracle-Reattach im aktuellen CLI-Flow stabiler sein soll." \
  --oracle-mode assist \
  --submit \
  --allow-paid-quota-use
```

Use `--oracle-mode runner` only after the normal local guards pass. Oracle runner mode is blocked by the CLI when login, visible account, plan, feature, screenshot, rate-limit, or ChatGPT model-safety checks fail. For ChatGPT tests, the guard blocks Pro/Extended Pro/GPT-5.5 Pro selections before typing; use non-Pro Thinking, Agent, or Deep Research instead.

Focused Oracle E2E smoke is opt-in only:

```bash
AI_RESEARCH_BROWSER_E2E=1 \
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py oracle-e2e-smoke \
  --browser brave \
  --profile work \
  --provider chatgpt \
  --mode thinking \
  --cdp-port 9223
```

Plan CloakBrowser Manager locally without storing proxy secrets in artifacts:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py cloakbrowser-manager-plan --port 18080
AI_RESEARCH_BROWSER_PROXY_FILE=~/.config/ai-research-browser/proxies.txt \
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py cloakbrowser-preflight
```

CloakBrowser provider workflows require a manually logged-in profile plus a verified account baseline. `workflow-run --backend cloakbrowser` blocks before any UI typing unless `--account-baseline` points to that proof. Keep proxy files local, mode `0600`, and never commit them.

List installed SaveAI / AI Exporter extension copies:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py extensions --ai-exporter
```

Inspect SaveAI / AI Exporter export and Notion-sync readiness:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py ai-exporter-capabilities \
  --output /tmp/hermes-ai-exporter-capabilities.json
```

The capability command reports supported providers, extension actions such as `exportFullMarkdown`, `copyFullMarkdown`, `openFullNotionExport`, and `saveFullChatsToNotion`, and whether Notion site cookies indicate a logged-in workspace. Treat Notion sync as an external write: export/cache locally first, then perform Notion sync only when the user requested that write.

Generate the current Unbrowser Local command plan:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py unbrowser-plan \
  --url https://gemini.google.com/app?hl=de \
  --prompt "Extract the visible provider state"
```

Run the current Unbrowser Local MCP stdio probe:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py unbrowser-mcp-probe \
  --url https://www.unbrowser.ai/ \
  --tool quick_fetch \
  --profile core \
  --artifact-root /tmp/hermes-unbrowser-mcp-probe \
  --output /tmp/hermes-unbrowser-mcp-probe.json
```

The probe starts `npx -y @unbrowser/local --profile=<profile>`, sends JSON-RPC initialize/tools calls over stdio, and writes `events.json` plus `status.json`. Use it for public-page extraction and Unbrowser capability checks. Keep paid provider workflows in `workflow-run`/`workflow-followup`, where browser profile, provider mode, account state, screenshots, and confirmation controls are recorded.

List model and tool catalogs:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py models
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py models --provider anthropic
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py models --provider google
```

The provider catalog should preserve common user aliases:

- `google` / `google-gemini` -> Gemini
- `anthropic` / `entropic` -> Claude
- `grog` / `xai` -> Grok

Keep provider model labels broad enough for the UI picker and exact enough for E2E assertions. Current examples include ChatGPT `GPT-5.5 Pro`, Gemini `Complex` / `Thinking with 3 Pro`, Perplexity `Sonar Deep Research`, and Grok `Grok 4.1 Fast Reasoning`.

Save the matrix for a later E2E run:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py matrix \
  --json \
  --output /tmp/ai-research-browser-matrix.json
```

Build the focused primary feature suite:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py feature-suite \
  --providers chatgpt,gemini,anthropic \
  --json \
  --output /tmp/hermes-ai-feature-suite-plan.json
```

Run Agent Browser against disposable profile clones:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py agent-browser-suite \
  --providers chatgpt,gemini,anthropic \
  --artifact-root /tmp/hermes-ai-research-agent-browser-e2e \
  --clone-root /tmp/hermes-ai-research-agent-browser-clones
```

Use `--plan-only` to inspect the queue first, `--max-runs 1` for a smoke test, and `--timeout 15` when a cloned browser is flaky. Treat `signed-out-or-wall` and `timeout` as real failed-login/automation-wall findings, not as success. For final account, plan, model, and quota proof, verify with a real running browser through Computer Use or a hidden CDP launch.

Before starting Gemini Deep Research or any paid workflow that must reuse the real account, run the real-session preflight. For an ambiguous "Starte Deep Research" request, prefer Comet/Gemini first:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py real-session-preflight \
  --browser comet \
  --profile work \
  --provider google \
  --port 9333 \
  --output /tmp/hermes-real-session-preflight-comet-gemini.json
```

`real-session-preflight` reports `can_attach`, `attach_port`, CDP endpoint attempts, port owner, running-browser blockers, `port_collision`, `alternate_cdp`, and provider session evidence. Port `9333` is only the preferred Comet port; if it belongs to VS Code, Code Helper, another browser, or any non-CDP listener, first use a discovered `attach_port` from the running Comet process if available, otherwise use `browser-cdp-recover --dry-run` and the recovered free port instead of treating the occupied port as Comet. If a disposable clone lands on a sign-in page while the real profile still has local provider session evidence, workflow runs are marked `real-session-required`. Do not claim Gemini Deep Research, ChatGPT Agent, or ChatGPT Deep Research started until a real CDP-enabled browser session or a dedicated minimized browser window confirms the provider UI state.

The profile alias `work` resolves by exact directory/name/account first, then by Work/Arbeit labels, and finally to the only discovered profile when a browser has exactly one local profile. This lets single-profile Comet/Komet setups run through `--profile work` without hard-coding a machine-specific directory name.

Run fixed provider workflows from a temporary profile clone:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py workflow-plan \
  --browser brave \
  --profile work \
  --provider chatgpt \
  --mode agent \
  --prompt "Custom prompt" \
  --submit \
  --confirm-start
```

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py workflow-run \
  --browser comet \
  --profile work \
  --provider google \
  --mode deep-research \
  --prompt "Custom Deep Research prompt" \
  --submit \
  --confirm-start \
  --cache
```

Run the same workflow through a persistent offscreen sibling profile:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py workflow-sibling-run \
  --browser comet \
  --profile work \
  --provider google \
  --mode deep-research \
  --prompt "Custom Deep Research prompt" \
  --submit \
  --confirm-start \
  --cache
```

Use `--sibling-user-data <dir>` for an explicit automation profile, `--refresh-sibling` to re-seed it from the source profile, and `--close-after` for smoke tests. Omit `--submit` for setup/dry-runs and do not claim Deep Research/Agent started unless the status artifacts show the provider UI was logged in and the requested mode was visible.

Initialize a fresh sibling profile for manual provider login:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py sibling-profile-init \
  --browser comet \
  --profile work \
  --provider google \
  --sibling-user-data ~/.cache/ai-research-browser/sibling-profiles/comet-google/user-data
```

If the workflow later reports `real-session-required`, the UI evidence contradicted local cookie/session evidence. Treat that as a required manual login/challenge step in the sibling profile, not as a started provider workflow.

Run the complete orchestrated evidence path for Gemini/ChatGPT/Perplexity/Grok workflows:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py workflow-orchestrate \
  --browser brave \
  --profile work \
  --provider google \
  --mode deep-research \
  --prompt "Custom Deep Research prompt" \
  --unbrowser \
  --unbrowser-session \
  --include-ai-exporter \
  --followup \
  --notion-sync \
  --output /tmp/hermes-gemini-orchestrate.json
```

`workflow-orchestrate` runs real-session preflight, optional Unbrowser Local MCP proof, optional Unbrowser `session_management` list/health, SaveAI / AI Exporter capability parsing, the Agent Browser workflow, optional "Fass zusammen" follow-up, and a Notion export eligibility plan. It does not quit or relaunch existing browsers. Notion sync remains ineligible unless `--allow-external-write` is set and a local exportable output exists.

Check Unbrowser saved session state directly:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py unbrowser-session \
  --action health \
  --domain gemini.google.com \
  --session-profile default \
  --output /tmp/hermes-unbrowser-gemini-session.json
```

Use Unbrowser session checks as supporting evidence only. A paid or long-running provider workflow still needs a real CDP/browser proof before Hermes claims that Deep Research or Agent actually started.

Attach an image or file when the provider exposes a file input:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py workflow-run \
  --browser brave \
  --profile work \
  --provider google \
  --mode chat \
  --prompt "Analyze the attached image." \
  --attachment /tmp/example-image.png \
  --cache
```

Attachment upload uses CDP `DOM.setFileInputFiles` against the temporary clone only. The workflow first opens known upload menus such as Gemini's `Menü „Datei hochladen“ öffnen`; if the provider changes the menu or still hides the file input, the workflow records `no-file-input` for E2E evidence.

Run the focused workflow suite for the main agentic/research features:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py workflow-suite \
  --browsers brave \
  --profile work \
  --submit \
  --confirm-start \
  --continue-on-failure \
  --cache
```

The default suite covers ChatGPT Agent, ChatGPT Deep Research, Gemini Deep Research, Perplexity Research, Grok Research/DeepSearch, and Claude Research/Search. Use `--plan-only` before a long run, `--max-runs 1` for smoke tests, `--features provider:mode` for a hand-picked queue, and `--all-features` for every workflow mode implemented by the script.

`workflow-run --strategy auto` is real-session first: it attaches only to a verified live CDP session or produces a restart-recovery plan when explicitly allowed. It does not silently launch disposable profile clones or sibling profiles for real ChatGPT/Gemini E2E; use `--strategy diagnostic-clone`, `workflow-sibling-run`, or `--allow-sibling-fallback` only when that isolation path is intentionally being tested. Before any UI typing, the workflow checks paid-quota permission, active cooldowns in `--rate-limit-state`, login/account/plan/model/feature evidence, and screenshots. If a provider rate-limit, CAPTCHA, challenge, or wait message was detected earlier, single workflow commands return `status=rate-limited` with `pause_required`/`resume_after` instead of retrying. Confirmation must use exact visible controls; do not let generic labels such as `Start` match dictation, voice, or unrelated UI. If no exact start/research control or running marker appears, keep the status at `submitted`.

After a long Deep Research run has produced a chat URL, send a follow-up summary request and export/cache the current chat:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py workflow-followup \
  --browser brave \
  --profile work \
  --provider google \
  --chat-url https://gemini.google.com/app/example \
  --prompt "Fass den Deep-Research-Report kompakt zusammen." \
  --include-ai-exporter \
  --attachment /tmp/context-note.pdf \
  --cache \
  --export-markdown /tmp/gemini-followup.md
```

Use the interactive picker:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py wizard --headful
```

Preview a hidden background launch for one browser:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py launch-background \
  --browser opera \
  --profile Default \
  --provider google \
  --mode deep-research \
  --model "Thinking with 3 Pro" \
  --dry-run
```

Preview hidden background launches for every launchable browser:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py launch-all-background \
  --provider chatgpt \
  --mode agent \
  --model "GPT-5.5 Pro" \
  --dry-run
```

Remove `--dry-run` only when you actually want to start the background sessions. Use `--headless` for zero-window browser processes; otherwise the CLI uses hidden macOS app launches and an `osascript` hide guard.

Capture account/login/quota status from visible provider UI text:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py accounts \
  --browser brave \
  --profile work \
  --provider chatgpt \
  --text-file /tmp/chatgpt-visible-text.txt
```

Build a local-only account/subscription audit across every discovered browser/profile/provider:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py account-audit \
  --output /tmp/ai-account-audit.json
```

`account-audit` reports `session_evidence` for ChatGPT, Gemini/Google, Claude/Anthropic, Grok/xAI, Perplexity, and OpenRouter. Treat `likely-logged-in` as a strong local session indicator, but still use `e2e-probe` or a visible UI capture for exact account email, subscription name, and remaining quota.

Parse already captured provider UI text files named `<browser>-<profile>-<provider>.txt`:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py account-audit \
  --text-dir /tmp/ai-provider-ui-text \
  --output /tmp/ai-account-audit.json
```

Treat `account-audit` JSON as private local evidence: it may contain names, emails, subscription labels, model names, and remaining Deep Research/Agent usage. Do not commit it.

List provider-specific probe hints:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py probe-specs
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py probe-specs --provider anthropic
```

Run a real Agent Browser/CDP E2E probe:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py e2e-probe \
  --artifact-root /tmp/hermes-ai-research-e2e \
  --browser chrome \
  --profile "Profile 2" \
  --provider chatgpt \
  --mode chat \
  --cdp-port 9224 \
  --open-controls
```

Parse a captured UI snapshot without touching a browser:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py e2e-probe \
  --artifact-root /tmp/hermes-ai-research-e2e \
  --browser opera \
  --profile Default \
  --provider anthropic \
  --mode chat \
  --text-file /tmp/opera-claude-visible-text.txt
```

Generate Oracle fetch/show commands:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py oracle-plan \
  -p "Review the provider E2E probes" \
  --file "skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/**" \
  --cdp-port 9224 \
  --deep-research
```

Parse visible existing chat names from a sidebar/list:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py parse-chats \
  --provider chatgpt \
  --text-file /tmp/chat-sidebar-visible-text.txt
```

Save a current conversation transcript into the cache:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py save-chat \
  --browser brave \
  --profile Default \
  --provider chatgpt \
  --chat-url https://chatgpt.com/c/example \
  --title "Existing research chat" \
  --text-file /tmp/chat-transcript.txt
```

Reuse cached chat data when available:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py chat-cache \
  --browser brave \
  --profile Default \
  --provider chatgpt \
  --chat-url https://chatgpt.com/c/example \
  --include-text
```

Force a fresh scrape/update:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py chat-cache \
  --browser brave \
  --profile Default \
  --provider chatgpt \
  --chat-url https://chatgpt.com/c/example \
  --text-file /tmp/fresh-chat-transcript.txt \
  --refresh
```

List the cache:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py list-chats
```

Check whether a browser/profile can be launched for CDP automation:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py preflight \
  --browser comet \
  --profile work
```

Build a hidden/headless launch command for ChatGPT Deep Research:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py launch-args \
  --browser brave \
  --profile work \
  --provider chatgpt \
  --mode deep-research \
  --model GPT-5.5
```

Use `--headful` when you need to see the browser or when a provider blocks headless mode. Model selection is recorded in the launch plan as `model_selection: select-in-provider-ui`; a real E2E must verify the model picker visibly selected that model.

Verify captured UI text against expected mode markers:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py verify-text \
  --provider chatgpt \
  --mode deep-research \
  --text-file /tmp/chatgpt-visible-text.txt
```

Record an E2E result with a screenshot path:

```bash
python3 skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/scripts/ai_research_browser.py record-e2e \
  --artifact-root /tmp/hermes-ai-research-e2e \
  --browser brave \
  --profile work \
  --provider chatgpt \
  --mode deep-research \
  --status verified \
  --screenshot /tmp/chatgpt-deep-research.png \
  --text-file /tmp/chatgpt-visible-text.txt \
  --note "Deep Research was selected in the ChatGPT tools menu."
```

## E2E Workflow

1. Run `discover` and choose an installed browser and profile.
2. Run `preflight` before attempting CDP/headless control.
3. If preflight is clean, launch with the generated `launch-args`; otherwise use Computer Use against the existing browser window.
4. Navigate to the provider:
   - ChatGPT: `https://chatgpt.com/`
   - Gemini: `https://gemini.google.com/app?hl=de`
   - Claude: `https://claude.ai/new`
   - Perplexity: `https://www.perplexity.ai/`
   - Grok: `https://grok.com/`
5. Select the requested mode in the provider UI.
6. Capture a real screenshot of the browser tab.
7. Extract visible UI text from Accessibility or the page.
8. Run `verify-text` and `record-e2e`.
9. Report whether the mode was truly started, only selected, blocked, or failed.

## Provider Notes

ChatGPT Deep Research is selected through the tools menu. A valid E2E needs to show the composer in Deep Research mode or a started research report.

ChatGPT Agent is selected through the tools menu or mode chip. A valid E2E needs to show the composer/task area in Agent mode or an active agent run.

Gemini Deep Research may be labeled `Deep Research`, `Recherche starten`, or `Start research` depending on locale and account state.

Gemini Agent availability varies by account and region. Record the visible account/model/quota text when it is shown.

Claude research and artifacts availability varies by account and current UI. A valid E2E should capture the visible mode marker, generated artifact panel, or sources/search state.

Grok may be typed as `grok` or `grog` in the CLI. Availability of research modes depends on the account and current Grok UI.

## Design Notes

This follows the same shape that makes Peter Steinberger's Peekaboo and Oracle useful for agents: separate discovery/snapshot JSON from actions, print a browser-control plan before touching a shared desktop, and avoid profile races by reusing reachable browser state or reporting blockers. The `matrix` command is the snapshot, while `wizard`, `launch-args`, `launch-background`, `launch-all-background`, `verify-text`, and `record-e2e` are the action/evidence layer.

If a user says "Oracle" in this context, check Peter Steinberger's `steipete/oracle` pattern first: API mode when possible, browser mode only with an explicit control plan, remote/reachable browser reuse, auto-reattach, Deep Research, and session artifacts. The CLI exposes Oracle as `oracle` for consult/code-review help and long-running session capture, and `oracle-plan` prints dry-run/status/session commands. It exposes OpenAI CUA as `openai-cua`, but keeps local logged-in browser profiles under `playwright-cdp`, `computer-use`, `agent-browser`, or `peekaboo`.

## Testing

Run unit tests from the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s skills/software-development/ai-research-browser/tests -p 'test_*.py'
```
