# Foundry Doc / Vision / Speech

This skill wires the **non-chat AI services** every threadlight process eventually
needs — image understanding, document parsing, voice — into the agent runtime.

It reads SPEC § 7b (AI Services & Model Selection) from `threadlight-design`,
selects the right Azure resource per modality, generates the tool contracts,
and emits the Bicep module selectors that `threadlight-deploy` Phase 6 + 
`azd-patterns` consume.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the SPEC declares ANY of:
- Image / photo / video frame analysis (returns triage damage photos, KYC selfie,
  blueprint annotation, supplier facility photos)
- Structured-document extraction (invoices, claim forms, KYC IDs, quotes, BOMs)
- Voice / audio (FNOL voice intake, call recording transcription, IVR responses)

If the SPEC only needs chat (text-in, text-out), you do NOT need this skill —
the default `gpt-5.4-mini` model from `threadlight-deploy` is sufficient.

## When NOT to Use

- **Pure chat agents** — `threadlight-deploy` handles the chat model
- **Knowledge retrieval over documents** — that's `foundry-iq` (semantic search
  over already-indexed content). Use this skill for the **extraction step that
  produces searchable text from unstructured docs**, then hand off to `foundry-iq`
  for retrieval.
- **MCP server deployment** — that's `foundry-mcp-aca`

## ⚠️ GPT-4o is LEGACY (May 2026)

GPT-4o and GPT-4o Vision are explicitly **forbidden** as defaults. SPEC § 7b
hardcodes the modern decision tree:

| Use case | Model | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Default chat reasoning | `gpt-5.4-mini` (2026-03-17) | 400K context, vision-capable, fastest, cheapest |
| Vision (default) | `gpt-5.4-mini` | Multimodal in same model — usually no separate vision deployment |
| Vision (high-stakes, large frames) | `gpt-5.4` (2026-03-05) | 1M context, more accurate on dense visual content |
| Vision + reasoning premium | `gpt-5.4-pro` | When the answer must reason about the image (e.g., "is this a structural defect?") |
| Bulk/cheap vision | `gpt-5.4-nano` | Background batch jobs, throwaway analysis |
| Code multimodal | `gpt-5.3-codex` | Screenshot → code, error UI → diagnosis |
| Structured docs | Document Intelligence v4 prebuilt | Field extraction with confidence scores; faster than vision LLM for known forms |
| Custom forms | Document Intelligence v4 custom | Train on 5+ samples of customer-specific forms |
| Voice → text | Azure Speech-to-Text (Whisper option) | Fast, batch, real-time options |
| Text → voice | Azure Speech-to-Text (neural voices) | For IVR, audio briefings |

If anyone proposes `gpt-4o`, push back: it doesn't support encrypted content,
has a 128K context vs 400K-1M, and is on a deprecation glide path. There is no
business case for new processes on legacy models.

## Pattern 0 — Foundry Toolbox (recommended starting point, May 2026)

Before wiring SDK calls per modality, **check whether a Foundry Toolbox can
do the job**. The Foundry Toolbox is a server-side, versioned bundle of
hosted tool configurations curated in the Foundry portal and exposed as a
single MCP-compatible endpoint. As of May 2026, the catalog includes
**Speech, Document Intelligence, Vision, Content Understanding, Translator,
Language, Content Safety, Custom Vision, Azure AI Search**, plus generic
hosted tools (web search, code interpreter, file search, image generation).

**Why prefer Toolbox over per-modality SDK code:**

- **Centralized config**: connection strings, SAS containers, model IDs all
  live in the portal — no env-var fan-out across containers
- **Versioning**: change toolbox config, test with `version="v3"`, promote
  to default — no agent redeploy
- **Auth handled server-side** for the upstream services (Speech / DocIntel
  account credentials are configured **once** at toolbox creation; the
  consumer only needs an Entra token to the Toolbox endpoint itself)
- **MCP-compatible consumption**: works with any agent runtime (MAF, GHCP
  SDK via bridge, LangGraph, custom code)
- **Same code across processes**: a healthcare KYC and an FSI claim agent
  can both consume the same `vision_doc_speech_toolbox`

**When NOT to use Toolbox** (fall back to direct SDK in Pattern A/B):

- You need fine-grained control over a SDK feature not exposed by the toolbox
  tool wrapper (e.g., DocIntel custom-trained model, Speech batch transcription
  with diarization, real-time streaming audio frames)
- Network-secured Foundry: **Azure Speech MCP doesn't support network-secured
  Foundry projects** as of May 2026 — you must use direct SDK in Pattern A/B
- Toolbox is preview (`azure-ai-projects>=2.1.0`); customer policy may forbid
  preview-tier features in prod
- High-volume batch (e.g., 100k invoices/night) — toolbox introduces a network
  hop the SDK doesn't

### Pattern 0a — DEFAULT: MCP consumption (works with ALL runtimes)

**Always start here.** `MCPStreamableHTTPTool` (or your runtime's equivalent
MCP client) talks to the Toolbox endpoint over HTTPS. This is the path the
Foundry team officially documents for MAF, GHCP (via bridge), LangGraph,
and custom code.

**Working sample (MAF — direct, with mandatory workarounds):**

```python
import os, asyncio
from typing import Any
# Use the SYNC azure.identity here — get_bearer_token_provider in the sync
# module returns a callable that returns a string when invoked. Using the
# .aio variant here returns a coroutine that gets f-string-formatted as
# "Bearer <coroutine object _provider at 0x...>" and the server returns 401.
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider
from agent_framework import Agent, MCPStreamableHTTPTool
from agent_framework.foundry import FoundryChatClient

# 1. Build a refreshing Entra token provider for the Toolbox MCP endpoint.
#    Scope MUST be https://ai.azure.com/.default — wrong scope = 401.
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()  # reads AZURE_CLIENT_ID for UAMI
token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(credential, "https://ai.azure.com/.default")

# 2. Build the MCP tool.
#    Endpoint format (note the "toolboxes/.../versions/.../mcp" shape — pin a version):
#    https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>/toolboxes/<name>/versions/<version>/mcp?api-version=v1
mcp_tool = MCPStreamableHTTPTool(
    name="vision_doc_speech_mcp",
    url=os.environ["TOOLBOX_MCP_ENDPOINT"],
    # GOTCHA: MAF calls header_provider(kwargs) — it MUST accept one positional
    # arg, not zero. Verified against agent_framework/_mcp.py in 1.x.
    # Use header_provider (NOT static `headers=`) so tokens refresh on expiry.
    header_provider=lambda kwargs: {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token_provider()}"},
    load_prompts=False,         # GOTCHA: Foundry MCP returns 500 on prompts/list
)

# 3. GOTCHA: MAF's MCPStreamableHTTPTool._ensure_connected() calls send_ping(),
#    which the Foundry MCP server rejects with 500. Override to a no-op.
async def _no_ping(*args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> None: return None
mcp_tool._ensure_connected = _no_ping  # type: ignore[assignment]

async def main() -> None:
    async with mcp_tool, Agent(
        client=FoundryChatClient(credential=credential, model="gpt-5.4-mini"),
        name="ClaimsIntake",
        tools=[mcp_tool],
    ) as agent:
        # GOTCHA: Toolbox MCP requires stream=True on tools/call.
        # MAF Agent.run streams by default — explicitly avoid stream=False overrides.
        result = await agent.run("Transcribe the call and extract claim details.")
        print(result.text)

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Working sample (GHCP — via the official MCP bridge):**

GHCP rejects dots in tool names; Foundry MCP returns names as
`{server_label}.{tool_name}`. The official sample at
`https://aka.ms/foundry-toolbox-copilotsdk` provides an MCP bridge that
replaces `.` → `_` automatically. Use that bridge — do NOT roll your own.

> **GHCP cannot use Pattern 0b (native).** Native toolbox attachment
> (`tools=toolbox` directly) is a MAF-specific surface that has no
> equivalent in the GitHub Copilot SDK. For GHCP, **Pattern 0a is the
> only option** — and you must use the published bridge.

**MCP gotcha cheat-sheet** (from official troubleshoot, all confirmed
May 2026 — these WILL bite if ignored):

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `401` on MCP calls | Wrong/expired token | Scope MUST be `https://ai.azure.com/.default`; use `header_provider` (refreshes), not static `headers` |
| `500` on `send_ping()` | Foundry MCP doesn't implement `ping` | Override `MCPStreamableHTTPTool._ensure_connected` to a no-op (see sample) |
| `500` on `prompts/list` | Foundry MCP doesn't implement prompts | Pass `load_prompts=False` |
| `500` on `tools/call` | Non-streaming not supported | Use `stream=True` (MAF default; explicitly verify if you override) |
| `400 Multiple tools without identifiers` | Two unnamed tools of same type in toolbox | Toolbox creator must add `server_label`/`name` to each MCP tool |
| Tool name not found / GHCP error | Foundry returns `{server_label}.{tool_name}`; GHCP rejects dots | GHCP: use the bridge that swaps `.` → `_`. MAF: use the dotted name as-is |
| Custom env var silently overwritten | Platform reserves `FOUNDRY_*` prefix | Rename your env vars (e.g. `TOOLBOX_MCP_ENDPOINT`, NOT `FOUNDRY_TOOLBOX_ENDPOINT`) |

### Pattern 0b — Native MAF (`MCPStreamableHTTPTool`)

Use `MCPStreamableHTTPTool` to connect a MAF agent directly to the
toolbox MCP endpoint. This replaces the removed `client.get_toolbox()`
convenience helper (removed in MAF 1.3.0).

- **GHCP SDK does NOT support this** — use Pattern 0a with the bridge instead
- The `allowed_tools` parameter filters to specific tools from the toolbox

```python
# MAF 1.3.0+ — MCPStreamableHTTPTool replaces the removed get_toolbox()
import os
from agent_framework import Agent, MCPStreamableHTTPTool
from agent_framework.foundry import FoundryChatClient
from azure.identity.aio import AzureCliCredential

async with AzureCliCredential() as credential:
    client = FoundryChatClient(credential=credential)
    toolbox_tool = MCPStreamableHTTPTool(
        url=os.environ["TOOLBOX_MCP_ENDPOINT"],
        load_prompts=False,
        headers={"Foundry-Features": "Toolboxes=V1Preview"},
        allowed_tools=["azure_speech", "document_intelligence"],
    )
    async with Agent(client=client, name="ClaimsIntake", tools=[toolbox_tool]) as agent:
        result = await agent.run("Transcribe and extract claim details.")
```

If something silently misbehaves (tools listed but never invoked, partial
schemas, schema-inference errors), **fall back to Pattern 0a (MCP)** — it
exercises the same upstream Toolbox endpoint with strictly fewer SDK
abstractions in between.

### Keyless RBAC for Toolbox consumption

Everything below assumes **keyless** auth — no API keys are passed anywhere
in the threadlight chain (we set `disableLocalAuth: true` on every Cognitive
Services resource at provisioning time per `azd-patterns`).

| Identity | Role | Scope | Why |
|----------|------|-------|-----|
| **Consuming agent's UAMI** | `Azure AI User` | Foundry project | Required to mint tokens for `https://ai.azure.com/.default` and read the toolbox MCP endpoint |
| **Toolbox creator (one-time, not runtime)** | `Azure AI Project Manager` | Foundry project | Needed to create/update toolbox versions and assign `Azure AI User` to consumers |
| **Foundry project's own MI** | `Azure AI User` | Foundry account | Project proxies inference + reads upstream tool credentials configured in toolbox |
| **Upstream service identities** (Speech / DocIntel / Vision MI) | per-service role (see Pattern A/B below) | each Cognitive Services resource | Configured ONCE at toolbox creation — consumers never see these |

> **Why `Azure AI User` and not `Azure AI Developer`?** `Azure AI Developer`
> is scoped to the legacy AML / Foundry-hub world; hosted-agent + toolbox
> resources need `Azure AI User` (or higher: `Azure AI Project Manager`).

**Toolbox catalog reference**: [Foundry tool catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/agents/concepts/tool-catalog)
· [Toolbox how-to (Python)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/foundry/agents/how-to/tools/toolbox)

If Toolbox doesn't fit (network-secured project, custom model, high-volume
batch), continue with Pattern A/B per modality below.

---

## ⚠️ Keyless / RBAC Matrix (every modality, every pattern)

Threadlight pilots are **keyless by default**. Every Cognitive Services
resource (`AIServices`, `DocumentIntelligence`, `SpeechServices`) is
provisioned with `properties.disableLocalAuth: true` per `azd-patterns`,
and runtime auth is via UAMI + Entra token. **No `KEY1` / `subscription_key`
appears anywhere in the chain.** When a customer needs to roll back to keyed
auth (rare — typically air-gapped lab), they explicitly opt in.

### The matrix

| Modality | Identity | Role assignment | Token scope | Notes |
|----------|----------|-----------------|-------------|-------|
| **Foundry chat (Responses endpoint)** | Agent's UAMI | `Azure AI User` on the **Foundry project** | `https://ai.azure.com/.default` | Project proxies inference using its own MI; this is the threadlight default |
| **Direct AOAI account endpoint** (bypassing project) | Agent's UAMI | `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` on the **Foundry account** | `https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default` | Only when you must hit the account endpoint — rare |
| **Foundry Toolbox via MCP** | Agent's UAMI | `Azure AI User` on Foundry project | `https://ai.azure.com/.default` | Toolbox creator (one-time) needs `Azure AI Project Manager` |
| **Vision via Foundry Responses** | Same as chat | Same as chat | Same as chat | Vision is a content-part on the chat call — no extra role |
| **Document Intelligence (direct SDK)** | Agent's UAMI | `Cognitive Services User` on the **DocIntel resource** | `https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default` | **NOT `Cognitive Services Contributor`** — Contributor only allows listing keys, and is denied at runtime when `disableLocalAuth: true`. Verified May 2026. |
| **Azure Speech (direct SDK)** | Agent's UAMI | `Cognitive Services Speech User` (or `Speech Contributor`) on the **Speech resource** | `https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default` | **REQUIRES custom subdomain** (one-time, **IRREVERSIBLE** — see Speech section) |
| **Azure AI Search (foundry-iq RAG)** | Agent's UAMI | `Search Index Data Reader` on Search service | `https://search.azure.com/.default` | Add `Search Service Contributor` for index management roles only |
| **Foundry continuous-eval** (Plan A built-in) | **Foundry project's own MI** (NOT the agent's UAMI) | `Azure AI User` on the project | n/a (server-side) | Project MI runs the scheduled evaluators against the agent — no consumer code |
| **Continuous-eval (Plan B ACA Job)** | Job's UAMI | `Azure AI User` on project + `Storage Blob Data Contributor` on results container | `https://ai.azure.com/.default` | Only if Plan A doesn't yet support your hosted-agent type |

### Why these specific roles (don't substitute)

- **`Azure AI Developer` is INSUFFICIENT** for hosted agents — it's scoped to
  the legacy AML/Foundry-hub world, not Foundry-project resources used by
  hosted agents. Use `Azure AI User` instead.
- **`Cognitive Services Contributor` does NOT work for keyless data-plane**:
  Contributor lists/regenerates keys; when `disableLocalAuth: true`, the
  data-plane explicitly rejects requests authenticated via Contributor.
  You need the `*User` data-plane role.
- **`Azure AI Project Manager` and `Azure AI Account Owner`** can ONLY assign
  `Azure AI User` to other principals (Microsoft-imposed constraint). They
  CANNOT grant arbitrary custom roles. If your customer needs a custom role,
  use `Owner` or `User Access Administrator` for the role-assignment step.

### Bicep wiring (pattern, per `azd-patterns`)

```bicep
// infra/modules/rbac.bicep — assign UAMI to each Cognitive Services resource
resource docIntelUserRole 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments@2022-04-01' = {
  scope: docIntelAccount  // resource symbolic name
  name: guid(docIntelAccount.id, agentUami.id, cognitiveServicesUserRoleId)
  properties: {
    roleDefinitionId: subscriptionResourceId(
      'Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions',
      'a97b65f3-24c7-4388-baec-2e87135dc908'  // Cognitive Services User
    )
    principalId: agentUami.properties.principalId
    principalType: 'ServicePrincipal'
  }
}

resource speechUserRole 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments@2022-04-01' = {
  scope: speechAccount
  name: guid(speechAccount.id, agentUami.id, speechUserRoleId)
  properties: {
    roleDefinitionId: subscriptionResourceId(
      'Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions',
      'f2dc8367-1007-4938-bd23-fe263f013447'  // Cognitive Services Speech User
    )
    principalId: agentUami.properties.principalId
    principalType: 'ServicePrincipal'
  }
}

resource projectAiUserRole 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments@2022-04-01' = {
  scope: foundryProject
  name: guid(foundryProject.id, agentUami.id, azureAiUserRoleId)
  properties: {
    roleDefinitionId: subscriptionResourceId(
      'Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions',
      '53ca6127-db72-4b80-b1b0-d745d6d5456d'  // Azure AI User
    )
    principalId: agentUami.properties.principalId
    principalType: 'ServicePrincipal'
  }
}
```

> **Verification step (always run before declaring the pilot ready):**
> from inside the running container, `az login --identity --client-id $AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
> then `az rest --method GET --uri "<resource-endpoint>/health"` to confirm
> the token works against each Cognitive Services data-plane. Don't ship a
> pilot where you've never proven RBAC end-to-end.

## Per-Modality Wiring (direct SDK — fallback when Toolbox doesn't fit)

### Vision (default `gpt-5.4-mini` via the Foundry Responses endpoint)

The Foundry Responses endpoint handles vision input as content parts in the
message. No separate model deployment unless SPEC § 7b explicitly upgrades.

There are two equally-valid client patterns — pick by **who owns the agent
loop**:

**Pattern A — Foundry-hosted agent calling vision as a tool** (recommended for
threadlight processes; the agent definition lives in Foundry):

```python
# src/agent/skills/<skill>/handler.py
from typing import Annotated
from agent_framework import tool

@tool(approval_mode="never_require")
async def analyze_damage_photo(
    image_url: Annotated[str, "Public/SAS URL of the damaged-product photo"],
    claim_id: Annotated[str, "Claim case_id this photo belongs to"],
) -> dict:
    """Score damage 1-10 and extract visible fields from the photo."""
    # The hosted agent's chat model handles the vision content part;
    # this tool just preps the input and returns a structured result.
    from openai import AsyncAzureOpenAI
    # The Foundry Responses endpoint accepts standard OpenAI client calls.
    # Vision JSON-mode on the Responses API uses `text={"format": {...}}`,
    # NOT the Chat-Completions `response_format=` kwarg. Verified against
    # openai-python (responses.py) — passing response_format silently degrades
    # to free-form text and breaks json.loads downstream.
    response = await openai_client.responses.create(
        model="gpt-5.4-mini",
        input=[{
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "input_text", "text": "Score the damage 1-10 and extract visible fields. Return JSON."},
                {"type": "input_image", "image_url": image_url},
            ],
        }],
        text={"format": {"type": "json_object"}},
    )
    return json.loads(response.output_text)
```

The `openai_client` is obtained at agent startup. The Foundry Responses endpoint
exposes Async OpenAI client calls; create it with the async AIProjectClient and
pass `agent_name=` so calls are routed to the bound hosted agent:

```python
from azure.ai.projects.aio import AIProjectClient
from azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential

async with (
    DefaultAzureCredential() as cred,
    AIProjectClient(
        endpoint=PROJECT_ENDPOINT,
        credential=cred,
        allow_preview=True,   # required when using agent_name on get_openai_client
    ) as project,
):
    openai_client = project.get_openai_client(agent_name=AGENT_NAME)
    # Inject openai_client into the agent runtime / tool registry
    ...
```

**Pattern B — Standalone agent with `FoundryChatClient`** (when your app owns
the agent loop, instructions, tools — e.g., from a receiver scaffold or batch
job):

```python
from agent_framework import Agent
from agent_framework.foundry import FoundryChatClient
from azure.identity import AzureCliCredential

agent = Agent(
    client=FoundryChatClient(
        project_endpoint=PROJECT_ENDPOINT,
        model="gpt-5.4-mini",
        credential=AzureCliCredential(),
    ),
    name="DamageAnalyzer",
    instructions="You score photos for damage and extract visible fields.",
)
response = await agent.run([
    {"type": "input_text", "text": "Score 1-10 and extract."},
    {"type": "input_image", "image_url": image_url},
])
```

For the high-stakes path (e.g., medical, structural defect, fraud-detect),
swap the model to `gpt-5.4-pro` — same API shape, different deployment name.

> **SDK version pin (May 2026)**: `agent-framework`, `agent-framework-foundry`,
> `azure-ai-projects>=2.0.0`. Imports moved out of the legacy `agent_framework.azure`
> namespace — use `from agent_framework.foundry import FoundryChatClient` (not the
> old `AzureAIAgentClient`).

### Document Intelligence v4 (prebuilt)

Use prebuilt models for ID, invoice, receipt, business card, contract,
W-2, tax forms, layout. Returns structured JSON + confidence scores.

```python
# src/agent/skills/<skill>/handler.py
from azure.ai.documentintelligence.aio import DocumentIntelligenceClient
from azure.ai.documentintelligence.models import AnalyzeDocumentRequest
from azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential

async def extract_invoice(blob_url: str) -> dict:
    async with (
        DefaultAzureCredential() as cred,
        DocumentIntelligenceClient(endpoint=DOC_INTEL_ENDPOINT, credential=cred) as client,
    ):
        # NOTE: the modern SDK uses positional `body=` (not `analyze_request=`)
        poller = await client.begin_analyze_document(
            model_id="prebuilt-invoice",
            body=AnalyzeDocumentRequest(url_source=blob_url),
        )
        result = await poller.result()
    fields = result.documents[0].fields
    return {
        "invoice_number": fields["InvoiceId"].value_string,
        "vendor": fields["VendorName"].value_string,
        "total": float(fields["InvoiceTotal"].value_currency.amount),
        "_confidence": min((f.confidence for f in fields.values() if f.confidence), default=0.0),
    }
```

> **SDK version pin**: `azure-ai-documentintelligence>=1.0.2`. The v4 REST surface is
> `2024-11-30 (GA)`. The package was renamed from `azure-ai-formrecognizer` —
> do NOT pull the legacy package.
> **Keyless RBAC pin**: assign `Cognitive Services User` (NOT Contributor — see
> matrix above) to the agent UAMI on the DocIntel resource scope. `DefaultAzureCredential`
> picks up the UAMI via `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` env var injected by ACA.

Threshold rule: if `_confidence < 0.85`, escalate to vision LLM for double-check
(exposes the field to the human action gate via `request-info`).

### Document Intelligence v4 (custom)

For customer-specific forms (their proprietary KYC questionnaire, their PIM
attribute sheet, their FNOL incident report). Requires training:

```bash
# scripts/train_custom_doc_model.py
az cognitiveservices document-intelligence model build \
  --resource-group <rg> \
  --account-name <docintel-account> \
  --model-id customer-kyc-form-v1 \
  --description "ContosoBank KYC questionnaire" \
  --build-mode template \
  --azure-blob-source <sas-url-to-training-set>
```

Training set: ≥ 5 samples of the form, labeled via Document Intelligence
Studio. Output is a custom model ID you reference in `prebuilt-invoice`'s slot.

### Azure Speech-to-Text

For voice-driven processes (FNOL, call center QA, IVR). Two patterns:

> ### ⚠️ ONE-WAY DOOR: Custom subdomain is IRREVERSIBLE
>
> Keyless auth on Speech resources **requires a custom subdomain**. The
> only way to set one is:
>
> ```bash
> az cognitiveservices account update \
>   --name <speech-acct> --resource-group <rg> \
>   --custom-domain <unique-subdomain-name>

## Pattern X — Vision-at-INGEST (NOT runtime tool) for diagram/comms corpora

> **Default to this pattern for any pilot whose source corpus contains
> diagrams, flowcharts, decision trees, or comms-template images.** The
> agent's runtime vision tool is the wrong layer for these — they're
> static, batchable, and citation-anchored, so extract once at ingest
> time and let `corpus_query` (or KB MCP) retrieve the structured text
> with `page_ref` metadata.

### Why ingest-time, not runtime

| Runtime vision tool (`vision_describe_*`) | Vision-at-INGEST |
|---|---|
| Hits hosted-agent gateway throttle (~6 calls/warm period — see `foundry-hosted-agents` § Gateway throttle finding) | One-shot batch, runs in postprovision or ACA Job — never touches the gateway |
| Adds 3–8s per query to user latency (vision call dominates the LLM round-trip) | Latency cost paid once at ingest; user sees instant retrieval |
| Citations are unstable — model paraphrases on each call | Citations are stable text + `page_ref` field on the chunk |
| Vision tool fails → user-facing failure | Ingest fails → re-run postprovision |
| Sample images shipped in container = Dockerfile COPY trap (see Gotchas below) | Source corpus is a one-shot input, processed before deploy |

### CU prebuilt-layout vs direct vision-LLM (validated tradeoff)

Azure Content Understanding's `prebuilt-layout` analyzer is **excellent
for text + tables** but **mangles diagram OCR**: flowchart node labels
returned as `connects → cmnects → cmnects` style garbled output.
Diagram semantics (which step → which decision → which next step) are
LOST. Direct gpt-5.4-mini vision with a structured prompt recovers
them. Recommended split:

| Source kind | Recommended extractor |
|---|---|
| Native PDF text body, tables, headings | CU `prebuilt-layout` (fast, accurate, $0.01/page) |
| Embedded diagrams / flowcharts / decision trees in PDFs | Direct vision-LLM per page (this pattern) |
| Standalone JPG/PNG comms templates (SMS, email screenshots) | Direct vision-LLM per image |
| .docx with semantic structure | `mammoth` direct extract — no OCR needed |
| Audio / video | Azure Speech batch (separate path) |

### `VisionClient` — minimal AAD-raw-requests pattern (no openai SDK dep)

The ingest script runs in a postprovision hook or ACA Job. Pulling the
full `openai` SDK just for chat-completions is overkill (50+ MB of
transitive deps). This 60-line wrapper uses raw `requests` against the
chat-completions endpoint with AAD bearer tokens:

```python
import base64, time
import requests
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider

DEFAULT_API_VERSION = "2024-12-01-preview"
MAX_TOKENS = 1500


class VisionClient:
    """Minimal Azure OpenAI vision client using AAD auth, no SDK dependency.

    Uses raw `requests` against the chat-completions endpoint so an
    ingest script runs in postprovision without pulling the openai SDK.
    """

    def __init__(self, endpoint: str, deployment: str, api_version: str = DEFAULT_API_VERSION):
        self.endpoint = endpoint.rstrip("/")
        self.deployment = deployment
        self.api_version = api_version
        cred = DefaultAzureCredential()
        self._token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(
            cred, "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default"
        )

    def describe(self, image_bytes: bytes, prompt: str, mime: str = "image/png",
                 max_tokens: int = MAX_TOKENS, retries: int = 3) -> str:
        b64 = base64.b64encode(image_bytes).decode("ascii")
        url = (f"{self.endpoint}/openai/deployments/{self.deployment}"
               f"/chat/completions?api-version={self.api_version}")
        body = {
            "messages": [
                {"role": "system",
                 "content": "You are a precise visual extractor. Output plain text only."},
                {

                        {"type": "text", "text": prompt},
                        {"type": "image_url",
                         "image_url": {"url": f"data:{mime};base64,{b64}"}},
                    ],
                },
            ],
            "max_completion_tokens": max_tokens,   # NOT max_tokens (see Gotchas)
            "temperature": 0.1,
        }
        for attempt in range(1, retries + 1):
            tok = self._token_provider()
            r = requests.post(url, headers={
                "Authorization": f"Bearer {tok}",
                "Content-Type": "application/json",
            }, json=body, timeout=180)
            if r.status_code == 429:
                wait = int(r.headers.get("Retry-After", "30"))
                time.sleep(wait)
                continue
            if r.status_code >= 500:
                time.sleep(5 * attempt)
                continue
            if r.status_code >= 400:
                raise RuntimeError(f"vision call failed HTTP {r.status_code}: {r.text[:400]}")
            data = r.json()
            choices = data.get("choices") or []
            if not choices:
                raise RuntimeError(f"no choices in response: {data}")
            return (choices[0].get("message") or {}).get("content") or ""
        raise RuntimeError("vision call exhausted retries")
```

### `DIAGRAM_PROMPT` — flowchart extraction template

The prompt structure is the durable part — it forces the model to emit
a parseable shape that the chunker downstream can split + index. Brand
nouns, channel names, and trigger labels are pilot-specific:

```python
DIAGRAM_PROMPT = (
    "You are extracting structure from a customer-journey blueprint page.\n"
    "Describe the visual content of THIS PAGE in three sections, in plain text:\n\n"
    "1) PAGE SUMMARY (1-2 sentences):\n"
    "   What is on this page at a glance? (e.g. 'Day 1 overdue customer journey - "
    "assisted channel decision tree from missed-payment trigger through to agent escalation')\n\n"
    "2) DIAGRAM STRUCTURE (only if a flowchart/decision tree/process diagram is present):\n"
    "   List nodes and decisions in the order they appear, using this format:\n"
    "     [START]  Customer searches 'missed loan payment <brand>'\n"
    "     [STEP]   Goes to <brand>.<tld>\n"
    "     [DECIDE] Logged into MyAccount?  --YES--> [STEP] Navigates to Billing\n"
    "                                       --NO---> [STEP] Information presented: Missed payments FAQ\n"
    "     [STEP]   Customer reviews advice on page\n"
    "     [END]    Connected Journey: I want to make a payment\n"
    "   Capture branch labels (yes/no, channel name, etc) and decision conditions.\n"
    "   If the page also shows pain points, KPIs or annotations beside the flow, list them.\n\n"
    "3) KEY ENTITIES / NUMBERS (bullet list):\n"
    "   Channels mentioned (Digital, Assisted, IVR, MyAccount, Bot, Webchat, Retail, etc.)\n"
    "   Day numbers, frequency labels, decision timers\n"
    "   Named systems (KM Tool, DPA-Security Checks, DCA, etc.)\n"
    "   Connected journeys referenced\n\n"
    "Be exhaustive but concise. If a section does not apply (no diagram, no entities), write 'N/A'.\n"
    "Do NOT invent content not present on the page. If text is illegible, write '[illegible]'."
)
```

The `[START] / [STEP] / [DECIDE] / [END]` brackets give the chunker a
deterministic split point and downstream search a way to surface
"decision points" specifically — the model converges on this format
within a few examples and the resulting chunks are dramatically more
queryable than free-form prose.

### `COMMS_PROMPT` — customer-facing comms template extraction

For SMS / email / letter screenshots, the goal is **verbatim message
body** plus structured metadata. The 3-section shape (META / MESSAGE
BODY / DESIGN NOTES) keeps the model honest:

```python
COMMS_PROMPT = (
    "You are describing a customer-facing comms template image.\n"
    "Output in three labeled sections in plain text:\n\n"
    "1) META:\n"
    "   - channel: SMS | email | letter | push | other\n"
    "   - audience: who this targets (e.g. 'overdue Pay-Monthly customer Day 1')\n"
    "   - trigger: what event sends this (e.g. 'missed payment + Day = 1')\n\n"
    "2) MESSAGE BODY (verbatim text from the image, preserving line breaks):\n"
    "   <copy the visible text exactly>\n\n"
    "3) DESIGN NOTES:\n"
    "   - branding cues (logo, colours)\n"
    "   - links / CTAs visible\n"
    "   - any disclaimer, regulatory text or accessibility note\n\n"
    "If text is illegible write '[illegible]'."
)
```

Token budget for COMMS_PROMPT can be tighter (~900) because the
verbatim-body section is the only big payload; for DIAGRAM_PROMPT use
1500–2500 tokens because dense diagram pages exhaust 900 quickly (see
Gotchas).

### PDF page rendering — `pypdfium2` over `pymupdf`

The diagram extractor renders each PDF page to PNG, then sends to
vision. **Use `pypdfium2`, not `pymupdf`** — `pymupdf` is AGPL-licensed
which most enterprise pilots can't ship; `pypdfium2` is MIT-licensed
PDFium-based and has API parity for the common case:

```python
import io
import pypdfium2 as pdfium

DEFAULT_DPI = 200   # sweet spot: fidelity vs cost (768 KB per page typical)

def render_pdf_pages(pdf_path):
    pdf = pdfium.PdfDocument(pdf_path)
    scale = DEFAULT_DPI / 72.0
    for i, page in enumerate(pdf, start=1):
        try:
            pil_image = page.render(scale=scale).to_pil()
            buf = io.BytesIO()
            pil_image.save(buf, format="PNG", optimize=True)
            yield i, buf.getvalue()
        finally:
            page.close()
    pdf.close()
```

DPI=200 is the validated sweet spot: lower (e.g. 150) starts dropping
flowchart node-label legibility; higher (e.g. 300) doubles the image
size with no measurable accuracy gain on chart/diagram OCR.

### Output schema (for downstream KB indexing)

Each extracted page → one JSONL line in `visual_chunks.jsonl`,
co-located with the text-side `chunks.jsonl`. The downstream ingest
merges both streams into the single KB index:

```jsonl
{"id": "journey-pdf-p06", "source_file": "I have missed a loan payment V1.3.pdf", "source_type": "journey", "kind": "visual", "visual_kind": "diagram", "page_ref": "page:6", "version": "1.3", "effective_date": "2025-06-04", "title": "Assisted journey - vulnerability branch", "content": "PAGE SUMMARY: ...\n\nDIAGRAM STRUCTURE:\n[START] ...\n\nKEY ENTITIES:\n- ..."}
{"id": "comm-day1-overdue-evo", "source_file": "Overdue balance evo step 1 day 1.jpg", "source_type": "comms", "kind": "visual", "visual_kind": "comm", "page_ref": null, "version": "current", "title": "Day-1 overdue EVO email", "content": "META:\n- channel: email\n- audience: ...\n\nMESSAGE BODY:\n<verbatim>\n\nDESIGN NOTES:\n..."}
```

Cross-link with `foundry-iq` SKILL § 9 (visual chunks with `page_ref`)
for the corresponding KB-side schema and § 11 for the per-source
manifest pattern that makes re-extract cheap (sha256 + mtime; skip
unchanged sources).

### Cost reality check

For a typical pilot corpus (1 PDF × 12 pages + 4 standalone comms
JPGs + ~20 text DOCX): vision spend ≈ **$0.10 per full re-extract**
(16 vision calls × ~2K tokens each at gpt-5.4-mini rates). Negligible
compared to the operational cost of a per-query runtime vision tool
that hits the gateway throttle.

## SPEC § 7b decision rules (what this skill expects to read)

The spec template forbids GPT-4o and prescribes the May-2026 model lineup.
This skill assumes those rules are followed; if SPEC § 7b says `gpt-4o`,
**fail loudly** and ask the spec author to update.

```yaml
# specs/SPEC.md § 7b (excerpted)
ai_services:
  chat: { model: gpt-5.4-mini, deployment: chat-default }
  vision:
    model: gpt-5.4-mini    # OR gpt-5.4 / gpt-5.4-pro / gpt-5.4-nano per use case
    use_case: free-form-photo
  doc_intel:
    tier: S0
    models: [prebuilt-invoice, prebuilt-id-document]
  speech:
    tier: S0
    region: eastus      # match Foundry region for low latency
    capabilities: [stt, tts]
```

---

## Bicep modules emitted (delegates to `azd-patterns`)

This skill does NOT own Bicep module shapes — those live in
`azd-patterns/SKILL.md` → "Composable Bicep Module Library". This skill
selects which modules `threadlight-deploy` Phase 6 includes:

| If SPEC § 7b includes... | Module included | Owner |
|--------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| `vision` with non-default model | `infra/modules/vision.bicep` (separate model deployment in the Foundry account) | this skill |
| `doc_intel` | `infra/modules/doc-intel.bicep` | this skill |
| `speech` | `infra/modules/speech.bicep` | this skill |

If `vision.model == gpt-5.4-mini` (the chat default), no separate vision module
is needed — the chat deployment handles vision content parts natively.

---

## Tool Contracts (template)

Generated tools always follow this shape, so they compose cleanly with the
agent's other tool-using skills:

```python
@tool(approval_mode="never_require")
async def analyze_damage_photo(image_url: str, claim_id: str) -> dict:
    """Score damage 1-10 and extract visible fields from a damaged-product photo.
    Use ONLY when the SPEC business rule requires visual evidence.
    Returns: { score: int 1-10, severity: str, visible_fields: dict, confidence: float }
    """
    ...
```

Tool naming: verb_noun snake_case, prefixed by modality
(`analyze_*`, `extract_*`, `transcribe_*`, `synthesize_*`).

| **gpt-5.4-mini vision returns truncated/garbled output** | Used `max_tokens=N` instead of `max_completion_tokens=N` in the chat-completions body | gpt-5.4-mini chat-completions vision REQUIRES `max_completion_tokens=N` — the older `max_tokens=N` is silently ignored or returns truncated output. Validated May 2026 |
| **Vision API rejects image > 4MP** OR returns garbage on dense flowchart | Image too large for the model's vision token budget | Pre-resize ≤2048px max edge with `Image.LANCZOS` + JPEG re-encode quality=88 BEFORE base64 encode.

| **Vision tool returns `vision_unavailable` even though deployment exists** | `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` env var set in azd env but NOT propagated to container's runtime env via agent.yaml `environment_variables` | Explicitly enumerate every env var the vision tool reads in `agent.yaml`'s `environment_variables` block — these are NOT auto-injected from azd env. Pattern: `environment_variables:\\n  - name: AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT\\n    value: ${AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT}\\n  - name: VISION_DEPLOYMENT_NAME\\n    value: my-vision-deployment` |
| **Comms-tuned 900-token budget exhausts on diagram pages** | A vision tool tuned for SMS comms (3-block META/BODY/NOTES, 900 max_completion_tokens) is reused for dense diagram OCR | Diagram pages need 1500–2500 token budget AND the DIAGRAM_PROMPT shape (`[START]/[STEP]/[DECIDE]/[END]` brackets). Comms images use COMMS_PROMPT and 900 budget. Don't share one tool across both — the prompt + budget mismatch ruins both outputs |
