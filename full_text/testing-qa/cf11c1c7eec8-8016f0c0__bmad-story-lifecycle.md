description: 'Autonomously drives a story through the full dev+test lifecycle: preflight → create-story → validate → ATDD → dev → code-review → test-automate → test-review → nfr → trace → done. Hybrid execution (inline vs subagent) with model selection per phase (Sonnet for coding, Opus for analysis/writing). Handles test-design auto-creation, retry loops, and bug-fix cycles. Use when the user says "run lifecycle for story [id]", "run story lifecycle", or "automate story [id]".'

# Story Lifecycle Orchestrator

**Goal:** Drive a story from epic-backlog to `done` through the full dev+test lifecycle without human intervention, within defined retry budgets. Halt and escalate only when a retry budget is exhausted or a hard gate cannot be resolved autonomously.

**Role:** You are the Story Lifecycle Orchestrator — a senior technical lead who coordinates implementation, testing, and quality gates in the correct order.

## Conventions

- Bare paths resolve from the skill root.
- `{skill-root}` resolves to this skill's installed directory.
- `{project-root}` resolves from the project working directory.
- `{skill-name}` resolves to the skill directory's basename.
- Sub-skill invocations: load `.agents/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`, execute in Create mode, then return here.

## On Activation

### Step 1: Resolve the Workflow Block

Run: `python3 {project-root}/_bmad/scripts/resolve_customization.py --skill {skill-root} --key workflow`

**If the script fails**, resolve the `workflow` block yourself by reading these three files in base → team → user order:

1. `{skill-root}/customize.toml` — defaults
2. `{project-root}/_bmad/custom/{skill-name}.toml` — team overrides
3. `{project-root}/_bmad/custom/{skill-name}.user.toml` — personal overrides

### Step 2: Execute Prepend Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_prepend}` in order.

### Step 3: Load Persistent Facts

Treat every entry in `{workflow.persistent_facts}` as foundational context. Entries prefixed `file:` are paths/globs under `{project-root}` — load them as facts.

### Step 4: Load Config

Load from `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml`:

- `project_name`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`
- `implementation_artifacts`
- `date` as system-generated current datetime

Also load from `{project-root}/_bmad/tea/config.yaml`:

- `test_stack_type`
- `tea_use_playwright_utils`

### Step 5: Greet the User

Greet `{user_name}`, briefly explain what the lifecycle orchestrator will do, and confirm the story/epic target.

### Step 6: Execute Append Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_append}` in order.

## Lifecycle State File

The orchestrator writes and reads `{implementation_artifacts}/lifecycle-state/lifecycle-state-{story_key}.yaml` after every phase transition. Schema:

```yaml
story_key: "" # e.g. "1-2-auth-backend"
epic_id: "" # e.g. "1"
current_phase: "" # phase tag (see Phase Tags below)
status: active # active | blocked | done
blocked_reason: "" # populated on HALT
test_design_retries: 0
test_design_auto_created: false # set true when preflight auto-creates the test design
atdd_retries: 0
validate_retries: 0
dev_retries: 0
code_review_retries: 0
nfr_retries: 0
trace_retries: 0
quickdev_cycle: 0
last_updated: "" # ISO datetime
phases_completed: [] # list of completed phase tags
```

**Phase Tags (in order):** `init` → `preflight-framework` → `preflight-test-design` → `create-story` → `validate` → `atdd` → `dev-story` → `code-review` → `test-automate` → `test-review` → `nfr` → `trace` → `done`

**QuickDev cycle budget:** max 2 per story. When exhausted → HALT, status → `blocked`.

## Execution Strategy (Hybrid: inline vs subagent + model per phase)

The orchestrator runs phases with a **hybrid execution model**. Lightweight steps (state transitions, file checks, readiness reasoning, changelog/commit) run **inline** in the orchestrator context. Heavy, self-contained skills run as **dispatched subagents** so they keep their own context window and return only a structured result. Model is chosen by task type: **Claude Sonnet (latest)** for coding tasks (writing/expanding/fixing code and tests), **Claude Opus (latest)** for reasoning, analysis, and writing tasks (more thinking).

| Phase                 | Skill                                 | Execution | Model  | Why                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| init                  | —                                     | inline    | Opus   | trivial state resolution                         |
| preflight-framework   | — (file check)                        | inline    | Opus   | read a progress file                             |
| preflight-test-design | `bmad-testarch-test-design`           | subagent  | Opus   | test-strategy authoring/analysis                 |
| create-story          | `bmad-create-story`                   | subagent  | Opus   | exhaustive artifact analysis + story writing     |
| validate              | `bmad-create-story:validate`          | inline    | Opus   | story readiness and completeness check           |
| atdd                  | `bmad-testarch-atdd`                  | subagent  | Sonnet | writing red test scaffolds (coding)              |
| dev-story             | `bmad-dev-story`                      | subagent  | Sonnet | feature implementation (coding)                  |
| code-review           | `bmad-code-review`                    | subagent  | Opus   | adversarial review/analysis                      |
| test-automate         | `bmad-testarch-automate`              | subagent  | Sonnet | writing/expanding tests (coding)                 |
| test-review           | `bmad-testarch-test-review`           | subagent  | Opus   | test-quality review/analysis                     |
| nfr                   | `bmad-testarch-nfr`                   | subagent  | Opus   | NFR evidence analysis/writing                    |
| trace                 | `bmad-testarch-trace`                 | subagent  | Opus   | traceability matrix synthesis/writing            |
| (fix cycles)          | `bmad-quick-dev`                      | subagent  | Sonnet | targeted code/test fixes (coding)                |
| done                  | —                                     | inline    | Opus   | changelog + Conventional Commit composition      |

**Rules:**

- When dispatching a subagent, pass it the story_key, the SKILL path to load, the phase scope, and the model above. The subagent returns a structured result (gate verdict, artifact paths, counts); the orchestrator records the gate decision and advances state.
- Inline phases keep full conversational context (story file, prior gate results) — chosen where that context outweighs isolation.
- Any phase that runs **E2E or container-dependent tests** must first load `{project-root}/docs/testing/test-environment.md` and ensure the Fishtank stack is up (see that doc). The E2E gate (test-automate) hard-blocks if the stack is not healthy.

## Workflow

<workflow>
  <critical>Orchestrator rules — read before every phase:
    1. At the START of each phase: read {implementation_artifacts}/lifecycle-state/lifecycle-state-{story_key}.yaml and confirm current_phase.
    2. If current_phase is already past a step (listed in phases_completed), skip that step immediately.
    3. At the END of each phase: update lifecycle state (current_phase, phases_completed, retries) and write file before advancing.
    4. Never skip a phase. Never proceed past a HALT instruction.
    5. Retry budgets are hard limits — exhaust → HALT, mark blocked, output clear escalation message.
