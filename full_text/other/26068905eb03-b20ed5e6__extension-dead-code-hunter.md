# Dead Code Hunter

Systematic dead code hunter for pi extensions. **File every validated finding as its own issue.** Each invocation picks random extension, analyzes using structured techniques, validates with proof, then files ALL valid findings as individual GitHub issues. If no dead code found in selected extension, discard it and pick another. Repeat until all findings are filed or all extensions exhausted.

## How It Works

### Phase 1 — Random Selection + Hunt Loop

This is a **hunt loop**. Core instruction: **keep hunting until ALL valid findings are filed.**

```
loop:
  1. Pick random extension from .pi/extensions/ (skip previously picked)
  2. Create hunt session label (dead-code-<ext>-<YYYYMMDD>)
  3. Run Phase 1.5 (knip preliminary scan)
  4. If knip found dead code → file EACH finding as separate issue (Phase 5)
  5. If knip found nothing or errored → run Phase 2-4 (understand + hunt + validate)
  6. For each dead code finding with confirmed proof → file as separate issue (Phase 5)
  7. Cluster: write cross-references, add session label to all issues (Phase 5)
  8. If no dead code at all → log reason, goto loop start (pick next extension)
  9. After all findings filed OR all extensions exhausted → output report (Phase 6)
```

**Critical rule:** Do NOT lower proof standards when hunt gets long. A finding without proof is not a finding. Skip and move on.

**Deterministic proof required:** All proof must come from deterministic tools (`ripgrep_search`, `structural_search`, manual code trace) — never from asking the LLM "is this code dead?" If you cannot find a `ripgrep_search` match or trace the control flow with certainty, the finding is speculative and must be skipped.

### Phase 1a — Random Selection

Pick one extension from `.pi/extensions/` using `bash ls`. Prefer subdirectory extensions (they contain multiple files, more surface area). Single-file `.ts` extensions also eligible. Do NOT pick same extension twice in a row within same invocation.

Selection method:

```bash
ls -d .pi/extensions/*/   # subdirectory extensions
ls .pi/extensions/*.ts     # single-file extensions
```

Pick randomly. Document which extension selected and why (e.g. "largest file count" or "most recently modified").

### Phase 1.5 — Knip Preliminary Scan

Before manual analysis, run Knip — an automated dead-code detection CLI. Knip analyzes the module graph (imports/exports) to find unused exports, unused dependencies, unused files, and duplicate exports. It runs in seconds and provides deterministic output that can be filed directly as an issue.

**Knip cannot detect:** unreachable code (after return/throw), dead branches (constant conditions), empty blocks, unnecessary conditionals, unused function parameters, orphaned imports within a file, dead event handlers, redundant code paths, or duplicate code blocks. These patterns require the manual Phase 2-4 detection techniques below.

#### Step 1: Run Knip

Run Knip against the selected extension directory using the root tsconfig:

```bash
npx knip --tsConfig tsconfig.json --include-entry-exports --directory .pi/extensions/<name>/
```

Flags:
- `--tsConfig tsconfig.json` — always use root tsconfig (extends `.pi/tsconfig.json`); extension directories do not have their own tsconfig
- `--directory` — scope analysis to the extension directory (knip v6 uses `--directory` flag, not positional argument)
- `--include-entry-exports` — also check exports of entry files, not just internal exports; ensures comprehensive coverage of extension internals
- No configuration file — knip uses defaults

#### Step 2: Parse Knip Exit Code and Output

Knip exit codes:
- **0** — no issues found. If exit 0 with no output → no findings. Fall through to Phase 2 (manual detection).
- **1** — lint issues found (unused exports, unused deps, etc.). Proceed to Step 3.
- **2** — execution error (bad input, missing dependency, internal failure). Fall back to Phase 2-4 manual detection. Do NOT abort the hunt.

Capture both exit code and stdout/stderr:

```bash
npx knip --tsConfig tsconfig.json --include-entry-exports --directory .pi/extensions/<name>/ 2>&1; echo "EXIT_CODE=$?"
```

#### Step 3: File Issues for All Knip Findings

If knip exits with code 1 and produces findings:

1. **File EACH finding as a separate issue.** Iterate through all knip output findings (each `file:line:col` entry). Do NOT batch multiple findings into one issue.
2. **Use the existing issue template** from Phase 5 — same structure, same severity guide (P0-P3).
3. **Technique** — set to `knip` (instead of a numbered technique).
4. **Confidence** — always **90%** for knip findings. Knip is reliable for statically-resolvable code (module graph analysis) but may have false positives for dynamically-invoked code (e.g., `Reflect.get()`, plugin loading by name string, dynamic import specifiers).
5. **Severity** — use the same severity guide (P0-P3) based on finding type and impact.
6. **Proof section** — replace the cross-reference search output with:
   ```
   ### Cross-Reference Proof

   Knip output:
   <raw knip output from stdout, relevant finding only>
   ```
7. **Issue creation** — follow Phase 5 instructions for `gh issue create`.
8. **Repeat** — after filing one issue, continue to the next knip finding until all are filed. Each finding gets its own `gh issue create` call.

#### Step 4: Fall Through to Manual Detection

If knip:
- Exits with code 0 (no findings), OR
- Exits with code 2 (execution error), OR
- Exits with code 1 but you choose to skip the finding (e.g., suspected false positive)

→ proceed to **Phase 2 (Code Understanding)** and continue with manual detection techniques. Knip only detects module-graph-level dead code; patterns like unreachable code, dead branches, empty blocks, unused parameters, orphaned imports, dead event handlers, and redundant paths require the manual techniques in Phase 3.

**Important:** If knip finds multiple findings, file each one as a separate issue before moving on. After all knip findings are filed, proceed to manual detection (Phase 2-4) for patterns knip cannot detect (unreachable code, dead branches, empty blocks, etc.). All manual findings also get filed as individual issues.

### Phase 2 — Code Understanding

Read the full extension before hunting. Use `read` to load all files.

For subdirectory extensions:

```bash
ls -la .pi/extensions/<name>/
read .pi/extensions/<name>/index.ts
read .pi/extensions/<name>/<other-files>.ts
```

For single-file extensions:

```bash
read .pi/extensions/<name>.ts
```

Understand:

- Purpose (what does it register? tool? command? event handler?)
- API surface (tool name, params, returns, events subscribed)
- Call graph (which functions call which, which exports consumed where)
- Dependencies (imports from pi packages, npm packages, node built-ins)
- Control flow (conditionals, loops, early returns, switch/case)
- Module structure (exports, re-exports, barrel files)
- **Package manifest** — check `package.json` for declared dependencies. These may have no actual imports (zombie deps).

**Dynamic code awareness:** Note any metaprogramming patterns (Reflect.construct, Proxy, dynamic imports with import(), Object.keys iteration over functions, getattr-like patterns). These can make statically-detected dead code actually alive at runtime. Flag at lower confidence when these patterns exist.

### Phase 3 — Dead Code Detection Techniques

Apply each technique below. For each, document what you checked and whether found anything. Assign a **confidence level** to each finding:

**Deterministic-first rule:** Every finding MUST be backed by either:

- A `ripgrep_search` showing zero references (for unused symbols/imports)
- A `structural_search` AST pattern match (for unreachable code / empty blocks)
- Manual traced control flow (line-by-line proof code path cannot execute)

Do NOT rely on asking the LLM "does this look dead to you?" — that is speculation, not evidence. If you cannot produce deterministic proof, skip the finding.

| Confidence | Meaning                                             | Typical for                                                     |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 100%       | Certain dead — code cannot execute or be referenced | Unreachable code after return/throw, function/method arg unused |
| 90%        | Strong evidence — dead unless dynamic invocation    | Unused import, zombie dependency                                |
| 60%        | Likely dead — may be framework-invoked              | Unused export, unused variable, empty block                     |

**Priority heuristic:** When multiple findings qualify, file them ALL. Order by impact:

1. Higher confidence first (100% > 90% > 60%)
2. Larger line count (more cleanup value)
3. More likely to cause confusion or bugs if modified

#### 1. Unused Exports / Functions / Variables

Check for exported symbols, functions, and variables that nothing references.

**Detection methods:**

```bash
# Check if a function/export is referenced outside its declaration file
ripgrep_search "myFunctionName" .pi/extensions/<name>/
```

- Search for each public function name — if only its declaration matches, it is unused
- Check private/helper functions — if only declaration + export line match, unused
- Module-level `const`, `let`, `var` not referenced outside initial assignment
- Parameters destructured but field never used in function body

**Patterns:**

```typescript
// UNUSED: exported but never imported by any other file
export function helper(data: string) { ... }

// UNUSED: variable assigned but never read
const MAX_RETRIES = 3;
// ... never referenced again

// UNUSED: destructured field never used
function process({ name, age, email }: User) {
  // only name and email used — age is dead
}
```

#### 2. Unreachable Code

Code paths that can never execute at runtime.

**Patterns:**

```typescript
// UNREACHABLE: after unconditional return
function getConfig() {
	return { color: "red" };
	const extra = loadExtra(); // never runs
}

// UNREACHABLE: after throw
function validate(input: string) {
	if (!input) throw new Error("required");
	return input.trim();
	console.log("validated"); // never runs
}

// UNREACHABLE: after break/continue in loop
for (const item of items) {
	if (item.skip) continue;
	process(item);
	break;
	cleanup(item); // never runs — break always before
}

// UNREACHABLE: both branches of if/else return
function getValue(n: number) {
	if (n > 0) return "positive";
	else return "non-positive";
	console.log("done"); // never runs
}

// UNREACHABLE: exhaustive switch with default before case
function handle(status: "ok" | "err") {
	switch (status) {
		default:
			return "unknown";
		case "ok":
			return "all good";
		case "err":
			return "error";
	}
	// switch always returns — anything after is dead
}
```

#### 3. Dead Branches — Conditionals That Never Vary

Conditions that are always true or always false, making one branch dead.

**Patterns:**

```typescript
// DEAD BRANCH: constant condition
const DEBUG = false;
if (DEBUG) {  // never enters — always false
  console.log("debug info");
}

// DEAD BRANCH: tautology / contradiction
if (items.length >= 0) {  // always true — length never negative

// DEAD BRANCH: always-true after null check chain
function process(items: string[]) {
  if (!items) return;  // items is string[], never undefined
}

// DEAD BRANCH: exhaustive enum/union check with impossible variant
type Status = "active" | "inactive";
function handle(s: Status) {
  if (s === "active") return "on";
  if (s === "inactive") return "off";
  if (s === "pending") return "wait";  // dead — not in type
}

// DEAD BRANCH: negated condition that's always false
function greet(name: string) {
  if (typeof name !== "string") {  // always false — TypeScript enforces
    return "invalid";
  }
}
```

#### 4. Unnecessary Conditionals

Conditions that always produce the same result.

**Patterns:**

```typescript
// REDUNDANT: identical branches
if (condition) {
	doSomething();
} else {
	doSomething(); // same as if branch
}
// Could be: doSomething()

// REDUNDANT: !! on boolean
function toggle(flag: boolean) {
	return !!flag; // !! is redundant on boolean-typed param
}

// REDUNDANT: ternary returning boolean literal
const result = condition ? true : false; // could be: const result = condition

// REDUNDANT: if-return-else-return
if (x > 0) return true;
else return false;
// Could be: return x > 0
```

#### 5. Duplicate Code

Identical or near-identical code blocks that should be unified.

**Patterns:**

```typescript
// DUPLICATE: same logic in two functions
function formatA(name: string): string {
	return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome.`;
}
function formatB(user: string): string {
	return `Hello, ${user}! Welcome.`;
}
// Only variable name differs — identical logic

// DUPLICATE: repeated condition chains
if (role === "admin") {
	grantAccess(role);
	return;
}
if (role === "admin") {
	auditLog(role);
}
// Two separate if-checks for same condition

// DUPLICATE: switch/case with same body
switch (color) {
	case "red":
	case "blue": // duplicate: both fall through to same handler expected
	case "green":
		processColor(color);
		break;
	case "red": // duplicate case
		processColor(color); // second copy of same handler
		break;
}
```

#### 6. Unused Parameters

Function parameters that are never read in the body. Also includes unused function/method arguments in callbacks, tool execute signatures, event handlers.

**Confidence: 100%** — If a parameter is declared but never read in the function body, it is certainly unused. Exception: only if the parameter is part of an interface/override contract where the parent signature requires it.

**Patterns:**

```typescript
// UNUSED PARAM: callback with unused context
function handler(event: Event, context: Context) {
  // context never read
  console.log(event.name);
}

// UNUSED PARAM: unused in tool execute signature
execute(toolCallId, params, signal, onUpdate, ctx) {
  // signal, onUpdate never used
  return process(params.name);
}

// UNUSED PARAM: unused in arrow function
items.map((item, index) => {
  // index never used
  return item.name;
});
```

#### 7. Orphaned Imports

Imports that are never referenced in the file body.

**Confidence: 90%** — Strong evidence but could be side-effect import (e.g. `import "module-alias"`) or re-exported. Verify both cases.

**Patterns:**

```typescript
// ORPHANED: import never used
import { readFile } from "fs/promises";
// ... never calls readFile

import path from "path";
// ... uses resolve but path import is for "path" — but if it's imported and
// no path.resolve() call exists, it's orphaned

// ORPHANED: type import with no type reference
import type { SomeConfig } from "./types";
// ... never uses SomeConfig in any type annotation
```

**Detection method:**

```bash
# For each import, search file for the imported symbol
ripgrep_search "symbolName" .pi/extensions/<name>/<file>.ts
# If only import line matches, it is orphaned
```

#### 8. Empty Blocks

Code blocks with no statements or only comments.

**Confidence: 60%** — Likely dead but may be intentional placeholder (TODO, future work, deliberate no-op). Check for explanatory comments before filing.

**Patterns:**

```typescript
// EMPTY: catch with no handling
try {
	await riskyOp();
} catch {
	// nothing
}

// EMPTY: if block with no body
if (condition) {
	// TODO
}

// EMPTY: function body empty
function noop() {}

// EMPTY: switch case with nothing
switch (x) {
	case 1:
	// intentional fallthrough (need comment)
	case 2:
		handleTwo();
}
```

#### 9. Dead Event Handlers / Tool Registrations

Event handlers or tool registrations that are never triggered or are overridden. Also includes code that is only invoked implicitly by pi framework (the pi-invocation pattern).

**Pi-specific whitelist:** The following patterns are pi framework invocations — do NOT flag code reachable only through these as dead:

- `pi.on(event, handler)` — handler invoked by pi runtime
- `pi.registerTool({ ... })` — tool execute invoked by pi runtime
- `pi.exec()` — child process execution
- `ctx.events.on(...)` — event listener set up by extension
- Any export consumed via pi extension manifest

**Confidence:**

- Event/tool handler body: 60% (framework-invoked, may be dead if never triggered)
- pi.on with non-existent event name: 100% (certainly dead)
- Tool with no prompt reference AND no external docs: 90% (very likely dead)

**Patterns:**

```typescript
// DEAD: handler registered but event never emitted by anything
pi.on("never_emitted_event", async (event, ctx) => { ... });

// DEAD: two handlers for same event, first is shadowed
pi.on("tool_call", handlerA);
pi.on("tool_call", handlerB);  // A is dead — B wins / both run but A's effect undone

// DEAD: tool registered but never used by any prompt or flow
pi.registerTool({ name: "old_feature", ... });
// No prompt references "old_feature"

// DEAD: subscription never cleaned up, handler no longer valid
const cleanup = ctx.events.on("message", handler);
// cleanup never called — handler still fires but should be dead
```

#### 10. Redundant / Dead Code Paths

Code that exists but has no functional effect.

**Confidence: 90%** — Strong evidence unless the dead computation is intentional (e.g. calling a function for side effect but discarding its return value).

**Patterns:**

```typescript
// DEAD PATH: assignment to local var that is never read
function compute(n: number) {
	let temp = n * 2;
	return n + 1; // temp never used
}

// DEAD PATH: reassignment before first read
let value = getDefault();
value = getReal(); // first assignment is dead — overwritten before read

// DEAD PATH: unused return value
function save(data: string): boolean {
	// ... persist ...
	return true;
}
save("hello"); // return value discarded — intentional? If so, why return?

// DEAD PATH: variable set but only mutated, never read
let cache = new Map<string, Result>();
function lookup(key: string) {
	// cache has entries set but never .get() called anywhere
	cache.set(key, compute(key));
	// never read from cache
}

// DEAD PATH: dead code in disabled conditional
if (false) {
	// This block never runs — deprecated feature?
	legacyProcess(data);
}
```

#### 11. Zombie Dependencies

Packages declared in `package.json` but never imported in any source file. These bloat install size, increase attack surface, and mislead developers about actual dependencies.

**Confidence: 90%** — Strong evidence. Only skip if the package is a build tool, type package (@types/\*), or used via CLI command (not import).

**Detection method:**

```bash
# List declared dependencies from package.json
grep -E '"@[a-z]|"\w+' .pi/extensions/<name>/package.json | grep -v devDependencies

# For each package, search all extension files for its import
ripgrep_search "from 'package-name'" .pi/extensions/<name>/
ripgrep_search "require('package-name')" .pi/extensions/<name>/
```

Also check if the package is referenced in any configuration file (tsconfig, webpack, jest config, etc.) or used via CLI in npm scripts.

**Patterns:**

```typescript
// ZOMBIE: package.json declares axios but no file imports it
// package.json: "axios": "^1.6.0"
// No "from 'axios'" or "require('axios')" anywhere

// ZOMBIE: devDependency with no usage
// package.json: { "devDependencies": { "mocha": "^10.0.0" } }
// But tests are in separate test dir or mocha not in scripts

// ZOMBIE: cli tool that could be npx
// "typescript": "^5.0.0" in dependencies when tsc is only run via npx

// ALIVE: @types/node — skip, type package
// ALIVE: rimraf used in scripts section only — skip if build-only
// ALIVE: package used only in CLI commands
```

### Phase 4 — Finding Validation (Proof Requirement)

Every suspected dead code finding MUST have deterministic proof. Rule: **"Cross-reference two sources"** — two independent confirmations before filing.

**No LLM-opinion evidence:** Evidence must come from deterministic sources — tool output (`ripgrep_search`, `structural_search`), code trace (control flow analysis), or file contents (import/export graph). Asking "does this look dead?" is not evidence. If both cross-references are LLM opinions, the finding does not meet the proof standard.

#### Proof Checklist

Each finding must include ALL of:

1. **Code evidence** — Exact line(s) showing dead code
   ```
   File: path/to/file.ts, line 42-45
   ```
2. **Why it is dead** — Explanation of why code never executes or is unreferenced
   ```
   Function `helper()` is defined at line 42 but never imported or called
   anywhere in the extension. ripgrep_search confirms zero references outside
   its declaration.
   ```
3. **Cross-reference proof** — Search result showing no callers / no reachability
   ```bash
   # grep for the symbol across the whole extension
   ripgrep_search "helper" .pi/extensions/<name>/
   # Output: only matches are declaration and export — no call sites
   ```
   Include the actual search output or summary in report.
4. **Confidence score** — Assign 60/90/100% based on technique type and verification depth
   ```
   Confidence: 90% — ripgrep_search confirms zero references outside declaration.
   ```
5. **Impact assessment** — Maintenance burden, confusion risk, bundle size, line count
   ```
   Impact: Low (12 lines) — unused export misleads future developers but no runtime harm.
   OR
   Impact: Medium (45 lines) — dead branch means safety check is never reached.
   ```

#### False Positive First Aid

Before filing, run through this checklist to reduce false positives:

1. **Is the code pi-framework-invoked?** — Check if the code is reached via `pi.on()`, `pi.registerTool()`, `ctx.events.on()`, or extension manifest exports. If yes, flag at 60% confidence or skip.
2. **Is it a side-effect import?** — `import "module-alias"` or `import "./polyfill"` intentionally has no symbol reference. Skip.
3. **Is it a dynamic invocation?** — `Reflect.get(obj, "methodName")`, `obj[methodName]()`, `Function.prototype.apply.call()`. These can make statically-dead code alive. Skip unless you can trace the dynamic call.
4. **Is it a debug flag pattern?** — `if (false)` should be `if (DEBUG)` where DEBUG is a configurable flag. Skip if the pattern is intentional for debugging.
5. **Is it an intentional placeholder?** — Empty function with TODO comment, empty catch with explanatory comment. Skip.
6. **Is it an override contract?** — Unused parameter in a function that implements an interface or overrides a parent class. Skip (convention: `_unused` prefix).
7. **Is it a forward reference for type annotations?** — `from __future__ import annotations` or string-type annotations `foo: "Sequence"`. Skip.
8. **Is it re-exported?** — Check if the symbol is re-exported via `export { symbol } from` or barrel file. If yes, the export is used even if the local reference is not.

#### When Proof Is Insufficient

If code is ambiguous (possible false positive), skip it. Do not file speculative findings. When unsure, re-read the full file to trace the execution path. If still unsure, skip.

Key validation rules:

- **Unused export**: Must grep entire extension directory. If found in tests or config, still counts (only non-test code matters). If found in another production file, it is used → skip.
- **Unreachable code**: Must trace control flow to prove no path reaches the line. Check all callers.
- **Dead branch**: Must prove condition never varies at runtime. Check if variable is ever assigned elsewhere.
- **Empty block**: Must confirm no side effects expected. Check TODO comments — if intentional placeholder, skip.
- **Orphaned import**: Must check import is not re-exported or used as type in another context.
- **Zombie dependency**: Must check all files in extension, not just one. A package may be imported in a different file than where it appears.

### Phase 5 — GitHub Issue Creation

Only create issue after proof is complete. Use `gh issue create` via `bash gh`.

#### Hunt Clustering

When filing multiple issues in one hunt session, cluster them so the group is discoverable:

1. **Create a session label** — Before filing the first issue, create a hunt-specific label:
   ```bash
   gh label create "dead-code-<ext-name>-<YYYYMMDD>" --repo <repo> --color "#B60205" --description "Dead code findings from <ext-name> hunt on <date>" 2>/dev/null || true
   ```
   Apply this label to ALL issues from this hunt session (in addition to `dead-code` or `bug`).
2. **Defer cross-references** — File all issues first, collecting their numbers. Then update each issue body with a `## Related Issues` section listing siblings:
   ```bash
   # After all issues created, update each body
   gh issue edit <N> --repo <repo> --add-label "dead-code-<ext-name>-<YYYYMMDD>" --body-file <body-with-cross-refs>.md
   ```
3. **Tracking comment** — Post a comment on the first/filed-with-lowest-number issue listing all:
   ```bash
   gh issue comment <first-N> --repo <repo> --body "## Hunt Session: <ext-name> - <YYYYMMDD>\n\n| # | Finding | Issue |\n|---|---------|-------|\n| 1 | <name> | #N |\n| 2 | <name> | #M |"
   ```

#### Issue Template

Each issue body includes a trailing placeholder for cross-references that gets filled after all issues are created:

```markdown

```

```

After all issues are created, update each one with cross-references and add the session label:

```bash
# Build cross-reference table
TABLE="## Related Issues\nSame hunt session (label: \`dead-code-<ext-name>-<YYYYMMDD>\`):\n\n| # | Finding | Issue |\n|---|---------|-------|"
SEQ=0
for URL in "${ISSUE_URLES[@]}"; do
  NUM=$(echo "$URL" | grep -oE '[0-9]+$')
  SEQ=$((SEQ+1))
  TABLE+="\n| $SEQ | <finding-name> | #$NUM |"
done

# Update each issue: add session label + cross-reference body
for URL in "${ISSUE_URLS[@]}"; do
  NUM=$(echo "$URL" | grep -oE '[0-9]+$')
  # Read original body, append cross-references, write back
  gh issue view "$NUM" --repo "$REPO" --json body --jq '.body' > ignore/update-${NUM}.md
  echo -e "\n$TABLE" >> ignore/update-${NUM}.md
  gh issue edit "$NUM" --repo "$REPO" --add-label "dead-code-<ext-name>-<YYYYMMDD>" --body-file ignore/update-${NUM}.md
  rm ignore/update-${NUM}.md
done
```

Read repo from `.pi/settings.json`:

```bash
grep -o '"repo"[^,]*' .pi/settings.json | tail -1 | sed 's/.*"repo": *"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/'
```

#### Labels

Always add `dead-code` label. Add severity label if exists in repo: `severity:high`, `severity:medium`, `severity:low`. If `dead-code` label does not exist on repo, use `bug` instead.

#### Existing Issues Check

Before creating issue, check if similar dead code already reported:

```bash
gh issue list --repo <repo> --label dead-code --state open --json title --limit 30 \
  | grep -i "<keyword>"
```

If duplicate found, skip and note which issue. Also check `bug` label issues for keywords.

### Phase 6 — Report

After all issues filed, update cluster cross-references, then output summary.

```
## Dead Code Hunt Report

**Extension:** <name>
**Session label:** dead-code-<ext-name>-<YYYYMMDD>
**Files analyzed:** <count>
**Total lines:** <approximate>
**Techniques applied:** <all 11>

### Findings

| # | Technique | Type | Confidence | Severity | Lines | Issue |
|---|-----------|------|------------|----------|-------|-------|
| 1 | unused-exports | Unused function | 90% | P2 | 15 | [#123](url) |
| 2 | unreachable-code | Code after return | 100% | P3 | 3 | [#124](url) |

### Summary
<total findings, total filed, any skips with reason>

### Cluster
All issues share label \`dead-code-<ext-name>-<YYYYMMDD>\` for bulk operations:
\`\`\`bash
gh issue list --repo <repo> --label "dead-code-<ext-name>-<YYYYMMDD>" --state open
\`\`\`
```

## Rules

1. **Hunt until all filed** — Must loop through extensions until ALL valid findings are filed or all extensions exhausted. Do not stop after first finding.
2. **One finding per issue** — Each finding gets its own separate issue. No batching multiple findings. No skip after filing one — continue filing the rest.
3. **Proof or skip** — No speculative findings. Ambiguous = skip
4. **Cross-reference two sources** — code evidence + why dead + search proof minimum
5. **No duplicate** — Check existing open issues first
6. **File cleanup** — Delete temp files after issue creation
7. **Track picked extensions** — Maintain list of picked extensions this run. Never re-pick same extension within one invocation.
8. **LLM is the hunter** — Do NOT delegate analysis to tools. Read code directly, reason about it. However, use deterministic tools for proof — do not ask yourself "is this code dead?" and accept your own answer as evidence. That is speculation, not proof.
9. **Structural search allowed** — Use `structural_search` for AST patterns (try/catch, if/else, switch/case, unreachable after return)
10. **Literal search allowed** — Use `ripgrep_search` for text patterns (symbol references, import usage, function calls)
11. **No false positives** — If you cannot prove code is dead by tracing the code path, do not file it. Low bar means skip extension entirely.
12. **All exhausted = report** — If every extension checked and zero dead code found, output full report stating that. No fabricated findings.
13. **Orphaned import nuance** — Some imports are side-effect-only (e.g. `import "module-alias"` or `import "./polyfill"`). These are intentional and should be skipped.
14. **Zombie dependency nuance** — Check `package.json` for unused npm packages. A package declared but never imported in any file is a zombie. Cross-check with `ripgrep_search` across all extension files.
15. **Confidence not negotiable** — If you cannot confidently classify a finding, do not file it. Prefer 100% findings over lower confidence ones when multiple options exist.
16. **Sort by impact** — When multiple 100% findings exist, file the one with largest line count or most confusing semantics. Bigger cleanup = better issue.
17. **Deterministic over LLM** — Always use `ripgrep_search`, `structural_search`, or manual code tracing to prove dead code. Do NOT ask the LLM (yourself) "is this code dead?" — that is speculation. Real proof requires a tool output or traced control flow. The only exception is confidence scoring (60/90/100%), which is a heuristic, not evidence.
