# Design Complete

Mark a finished design as complete, archive it out of the active designs directory, and clean up session state.

**Argument**: `{design-name}` (required) — must match an existing directory under `three-pillars-docs/tp-designs/`.

## Steps

0. **Run first-run preflight** per skills/_shared/first-run.md.

0a. **Run cwd preflight** per `skills/_shared/cwd-preflight.md`: `python3 "$TP_ROOT"/skills/_shared/cwd_preflight.py {design-name}`. Exit 3 → stop and show the `cd` fix. Exit 0 → continue.

1. **Validate the design name** per `skills/_shared/validate-name.md`.
2. **Resolve the design directory**: `three-pillars-docs/tp-designs/{design-name}/`. If it doesn't exist, tell the user and stop.
3. **Check if `-learn` has been run** (hard-blocks unless `--skip-learn` was passed): Determine whether this is a spike (has `spike-results.md`) or a full design (has `implementation-audit.md`).
   - **For spikes**: Check if the `product_roadmap.md` Design Inventory table has been updated with the spike's verdict (GO/PARTIAL/NO-GO). If not, **refuse to proceed**:
     > **Refusing to complete**: `/tp-spike-learn` hasn't been run yet — the Design Inventory doesn't carry a GO/PARTIAL/NO-GO verdict. That step propagates findings into project docs and scans for affected downstream designs; skipping it leaves the roadmap silently stale. Run `/tp-spike-learn {design-name}` first, then re-invoke this skill. If you have a specific reason to skip (e.g., the spike was a one-off scratchpad with no roadmap presence), re-invoke with `--skip-learn`.
   - **For full designs**: Check if the `product_roadmap.md` Design Inventory status reflects completion. If it still says "Designed" or "Pending", **refuse to proceed**:
     > **Refusing to complete**: `/tp-design-learn` hasn't been run yet — the Design Inventory status is still "Designed" / "Pending" / "Implementing". That step propagates implementation results into `product_roadmap.md`, `architecture.md`, and `known_issues.md`, updates the Design Inventory status, and scans for affected sibling designs. Skipping it causes the roadmap to drift silently across the completion boundary. Run `/tp-design-learn {design-name}` first, then re-invoke this skill. If you have a specific reason to skip — legacy designs that pre-date this rule, or designs where learn was run out-of-band and the roadmap status is intentionally stale — re-invoke with `--skip-learn`.
   - **`--skip-learn` escape hatch**: If the user passed `--skip-learn`, log a one-line notice (`Proceeding without learn per --skip-learn flag`) and continue. The flag exists for legacy designs and well-understood out-of-band cases; it must not become the default workflow. Do not silently treat absence-of-flag as override.
4. **Show a summary** of what will happen:
   - The completion date that will be stamped (today's date, `YYYY-MM-DD`)
   - Whether `handoff.md` exists and will be archived (banner added)
   - The destination: `three-pillars-docs/completed-tp-designs/{design-name}/`
   - The current branch and the base branch — after archival, a commit will be made on the current branch and (if the current branch is not the base) a PR back to base will be offered
5. **Ask for confirmation** before proceeding. A simple "Complete this design?" is enough.
6. **On confirmation, execute these steps in order:**

   a. **Preserve `handoff.md` — do not delete it.** It is the last live session state. It is bannered as an archive marker at its new location (step 6d1) and carried into `completed-tp-designs/` by the `git mv` in step 6c, so the **local** archive retains the real session prose for `/tp-session-restore` on this machine. **`handoff.md` is gitignored by design** (`skills/tp-session-save/SKILL.md` — session state may reference sensitive configuration, so it is deliberately kept out of version control): it therefore stays a **local-only** file and is **not** committed to the completion PR. "Archive" here means *preserve-and-banner in place*, not *commit to VCS* — the point is to stop deleting it, so the local operator can still restore the session, without moving session context into version control.

   b. **Create `three-pillars-docs/completed-tp-designs/`** directory if it doesn't exist.

   b1. **Merge any spec delta before archiving**: If `three-pillars-docs/tp-designs/{design-name}/spec-delta.md` exists, run `/tp-spec merge {design-name}` to merge it into the domain base spec at `three-pillars-docs/specs/<domain>/spec.md`. **This step is a no-op skip when the design has no `spec-delta.md`** (e.g., designs not scaffolded via `/tp-spec add`, like `living-spec-layer` itself) — if `three-pillars-docs/tp-designs/{design-name}/spec-delta.md` does not exist, skip the merge sub-step (no-op) and proceed to the `git mv`. If the merge is blocked (conflict or parse error), surface the error and stop — do not proceed with archival until the delta is clean or deliberately removed.

   c. **Move the design directory** using `git mv three-pillars-docs/tp-designs/{design-name} three-pillars-docs/completed-tp-designs/{design-name}` to preserve git history.

   d. **Stamp the completion date on `design.md` at its new location**. Edit `three-pillars-docs/completed-tp-designs/{design-name}/design.md`. If it already has YAML frontmatter (starts with `---`), add a `completed: YYYY-MM-DD` field to the existing frontmatter. If it has no frontmatter, prepend a new frontmatter block:
      ```
      ---
      completed: YYYY-MM-DD
      ---

      ```
      followed by the existing content (preserve a blank line between the closing `---` and the document body).

      **Why edit after the move, not before**: `git mv` transfers the index entry, not the working-tree content. If you edit `design.md` before the move, that edit becomes an unstaged modification at the old path; `git mv` then stages a pure rename with the pre-edit content, and your frontmatter quietly fails to make it into the archival commit. Editing at the new location avoids the trap — step 6f's `git add` of the new design.md path catches the rename and the modification in one shot.

   d1. **Banner the archived `handoff.md` at its new location** (step 6d1). If `three-pillars-docs/completed-tp-designs/{design-name}/handoff.md` does not exist (a pre-rule design, or a design that never wrote one), **skip this sub-step cleanly** — there is nothing to banner. Otherwise, prepend the dual archive marker to it: a machine frontmatter flag and a human blockquote.
      - If it already has YAML frontmatter, add `archived: true` and `completed: YYYY-MM-DD` fields to it. If it has none, prepend a new frontmatter block:
        ```
        ---
        archived: true
        completed: YYYY-MM-DD
        ---

        ```
      - Immediately after the frontmatter, insert the human-readable blockquote:
        ```
        > **📦 Archived handoff** — `{design-name}` was completed YYYY-MM-DD and archived to `completed-tp-designs/`. This is the last live session state, preserved for reference; it is not an active handoff.

        ```
        followed by the existing handoff content.

      **This is a local-only edit — do NOT `git add` it.** `handoff.md` is gitignored (`.gitignore` ignores `tp-designs/*/handoff.md` **and** `completed-tp-designs/*/handoff.md`; session state stays out of VCS per `skills/tp-session-save/SKILL.md`). The banner is applied to the moved file in the working tree and is **not** staged or committed — `git add` would refuse the ignored path anyway (and forcing it with `-f` would defeat the security policy). The bannered handoff is the local operator's record, read by `/tp-session-restore` on this machine; it never enters the completion PR. Edit at the NEW path (`completed-tp-designs/{design-name}/handoff.md`) so the local file that `/tp-session-restore` will resolve carries the banner.

   e. **Update Current Focus in `product_roadmap.md`**: If the roadmap has a `## Current Focus` table containing this design, remove its row and shift remaining priorities up (Priority 2 → 1, etc.). If removing this row unblocks another row (was listed in its "Blocked By"), clear the blocker and update its "Next Action" to the now-available step. Show the proposed changes and get user confirmation before writing.

   f. **Commit the archival changes** on the current branch:
      - **First, set `phase = "cleanup-pending"`** on `lock.json` at its archived location (`three-pillars-docs/completed-tp-designs/{design-name}/lock.json` — the `git mv` in step 6c moved it). This marker MUST land in the archival commit below, not in a later staging step, or it never reaches the PR and `/tp-post-merge`'s discovery gate can't find the design. (Step 6g references this as already-committed.)
      - **Run archive-time cite rewrite** (before staging), capturing the JSON: `RECONCILE_JSON="$(python3 "$TP_ROOT"/skills/_shared/reconcile_docs.py --archive-cites --slug {design-name} --apply --json)"`. This rewrites any `tp-designs/{design-name}` path cites in code and living docs to `completed-tp-designs/{design-name}` so cites on `{base}` are never dead between archive and post-merge. The `--json` output lists the rewritten file paths as an `edits[]` array (each entry carries a `path`). Stage exactly the `--json` file list alongside the archival paths — **by looping over it** (the staging block below), never a fixed hardcoded set, so a rewrite outside the fixed archival paths is never left unstaged. `--auto` runs this sub-step identically (mechanical, no prompt).
      - Run `git status --short` and verify the only changes are the archival paths **+ the reconcile `--json` file list**: the old `three-pillars-docs/tp-designs/{design-name}/` (as deletions from the rename), the new `three-pillars-docs/completed-tp-designs/{design-name}/` (additions, including any previously-untracked files like demos and decisions.md from a pre-rule-change design), optionally `three-pillars-docs/product_roadmap.md` (modified), and the rewritten files from the `--json` list. If unrelated changes appear in the working tree, stop and tell the user to commit or stash them first — the skill won't sweep unrelated WIP into the completion commit.
      - Stage the archival paths explicitly (do NOT use `git add -A` or `git add .`). The `git mv` from step 6c only stages tracked files; any untracked siblings in the design directory (e.g., `decisions.md` or `demos/` content from a pre-2026-05 design before those became tracked-from-creation) need explicit re-add at the new path. The `git add` of the new `design.md` path is also what captures the frontmatter stamp from step 6d — `git mv` staged a pure rename, this `add` rewrites the index entry with the post-edit content:
        ```bash
        # Tracked files that git mv already staged, plus the frontmatter modification at the new design.md path
        git add three-pillars-docs/tp-designs/{design-name} three-pillars-docs/completed-tp-designs/{design-name}/design.md
        # Catch any previously-untracked siblings that came along at filesystem level
        git add three-pillars-docs/completed-tp-designs/{design-name}/decisions.md 2>/dev/null
        git add three-pillars-docs/completed-tp-designs/{design-name}/demos/ 2>/dev/null
        # Roadmap update from step 6e
        git add three-pillars-docs/product_roadmap.md
        # cleanup-pending lock phase from the start of step 6f — MUST be in this commit
        git add three-pillars-docs/completed-tp-designs/{design-name}/lock.json
        # NOTE: handoff.md is NOT staged — it is gitignored by design (step 6a/6d1); the
        # banner from step 6d1 stays a local-only edit and never enters the completion PR.
        # Merged base spec from step b1 — the base spec lives OUTSIDE the design dir, so git mv
        # does NOT pick it up; it must be staged explicitly or it silently misses the commit.
        # If no spec-delta.md existed (the merge sub-step was a no-op), this line is a harmless no-op.
        git add three-pillars-docs/specs/<domain>/spec.md 2>/dev/null || true
        # Reconcile --archive-cites --json rewritten-file list: LOOP over it and git add EACH
        # rewritten path (closing the "a rewrite outside the fixed set above stays unstaged" hole).
        # RECONCILE_JSON was captured from the --json run at the top of step 6f.
        for f in $(printf '%s' "$RECONCILE_JSON" | python3 -c 'import sys,json; [print(e["path"]) for e in json.load(sys.stdin).get("edits", [])]'); do
          git add "$f"
        done
        # Sanity check before commit — design.md should appear as a rename WITH insertions (the frontmatter),
        # NOT a pure rename (0 insertions). If you see a pure rename, step 6d's edit didn't land in the
        # working tree at the new path; redo the frontmatter edit at the new path and re-add before committing.
        git status --short
        ```
        After this, `git status` should show no remaining untracked entries under `three-pillars-docs/completed-tp-designs/{design-name}/`. If any do, stage them too — the archive must be complete.
      - **Staged-blob guard — run AFTER staging, strictly BEFORE the commit.** The archived `design.md`/`lock.json` staged *index blobs* (not the working-tree files) must carry the completion stamp / `cleanup-pending` phase, and no live `tp-designs/{design-name}` cite may survive — inspecting the blob *after* the commit would be inert. Run the read-only helper:
        ```bash
        python3 "$TP_ROOT"/skills/tp-design-complete/scripts/verify_archive_staged.py \
          --repo "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" --slug {design-name}
        ```
        - **Exit `0`** → all staged-blob assertions pass; proceed to the commit.
        - **Exit `1`** (an assertion failed — a stamp/phase/cite that reached only the working tree, not the index): re-`git add` the specific offending path named on the helper's stderr repair line (the **double-add** — the fix for a stampful working tree whose index blob is stale), then re-run the helper. If it **still exits `1`**, abort loudly with the repair message and a **non-zero exit** — never commit a stampless / lock-phaseless archive.
        - **Exit `2`** (a precondition error — an archived path absent from the index, a bad slug): abort **IMMEDIATELY** with a distinct precondition message and a non-zero exit. Do **not** run the double-add retry — re-adding a path that is not there cannot fix a precondition error.
        - Under `--auto`: on any abort (exit `1` still-failing, or exit `2`), log the abort to `three-pillars-docs/tp-designs/{design-name}/decisions.md` (the sanctioned `--auto` audit-trail write, same class as the BLOCKED-learn logged exception) and exit non-zero so the orchestrator escalates.
      - Commit with a focused message. **The commit runs UNPIPED** (no `| tail`, no `| head`, no subshell that would swallow a hook's non-zero exit); capture the pre-commit HEAD first and, after the commit, assert HEAD advanced — a hook-blocked commit leaves HEAD unchanged and is a **failure**, not a success:
        ```bash
        PRE=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
        git commit -m "Complete design: {design-name}"
        if [ "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" = "$PRE" ]; then
          echo "archival commit did not advance HEAD (hook-blocked?) — aborting, not reporting success" >&2
          exit 1
        fi
        ```
        **Do not add any Co-Authored-By trailer** — respect the user's commit-style preferences.
      - If the commit fails (e.g., a pre-commit hook blocks it → HEAD unchanged per the check above), stop and surface the hook output to the user. Do not retry with `--no-verify`, and do not proceed to the PR step.

   g. **Offer to open a PR** back to the base branch:
      - The `phase = "cleanup-pending"` marker was set and committed as part of the archival commit in step 6f (do not re-stage it here). If you somehow reach this step with the lock still showing an earlier phase (e.g., 6f was hand-run without it), set it now and amend the archival commit (`git add .../lock.json && git commit --amend --no-edit`) **before** opening the PR — the marker must be on the branch the PR ships, or `/tp-post-merge`'s discovery gate can't find the design.
        This phase marker is the **discovery signal** that tells `/tp-post-merge` (and `/tp-merge-from-main` step 8) the design is awaiting teardown — it is *not* the safety gate. The actual gate is `/tp-post-merge`'s own merge verification (`verify_merged.py`); `/tp-post-merge` is the sole skill that runs post-merge cleanup, and it tears down only on a verified merge regardless of this marker.
      - Resolve the *default* branch: try `git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null` and strip `origin/`; if that returns nothing, fall back to `main` (then `master`) if the remote has that ref (`git ls-remote --heads origin main` / `master`). Call this `{default}`.
      - **Parent-aware base resolution** — the current branch may have been cut from another in-flight design's branch rather than from `{default}`. The PR should target the parent in that case so the design's lineage is preserved through to merge.
        - Compute the repo root: `ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"`.
        - Run `python3 "$TP_ROOT"/skills/tp-design-complete/scripts/detect_parent.py --repo "$ROOT" --design {design-name} --default-branch {default}`. The script inspects sibling designs' `lock.json` files (no namespace pattern matching — any branch name declared in `lock.json` is honored) to find branches that are ancestors of HEAD and have *not* been merged into `{default}`. Capture its stdout as JSON.
        - On exit 0, parse the JSON and branch on the `verdict` field:
          - **none** → set `{base} = {default}`. No prompt.
          - **single** → tell the user: `Detected parent design '{design}' on branch '{branch}'. Target this for the merge instead of '{default}'? (parent / default / other)`. On `parent`, set `{base} = {branch}`. On `default`, set `{base} = {default}`. On `other`, prompt for an explicit branch name and use that.
          - **multiple** → list each candidate numbered with design / branch / `last_touched`, plus `default` and `other` as keywords. Prompt for a number or keyword and set `{base}` accordingly.
        - On non-zero exit or JSON parse failure, log a one-line warning (`parent-detection unavailable; defaulting to {default}`) and set `{base} = {default}`. The default-branch path must always remain reachable — a buggy detector must never block a completion.
        - **Failure modes the heuristic can't catch** (worth knowing for when to override): rebased branches lose their original creation point so the merge-base ancestry breaks; force-pushed parents shift the merge-base under the script's feet; and if the user fast-forward-merged the parent into a different sibling, both will look like ancestors of HEAD until the parent gets deleted. The interactive prompt gives the user the last word — fall back to `default` or `other` when the detected target looks wrong.
      - Get the current branch: `git branch --show-current`.
      - **Skip** the PR offer and tell the user how to push manually if any of these are true:
        - No `origin` remote (`git remote get-url origin` fails).
        - Current branch equals the resolved base branch — there is nothing to PR; the archival commit is already on base and the user can push directly when ready.
      - Otherwise, ask:
        > Push `{current-branch}` and open a PR into `{base}`? (yes / no)
      - On **yes**:
        - `git push -u origin {current-branch}`. If push fails, stop and surface the error.
        - If `gh` is installed and authenticated (`gh auth status` returns 0), open the PR through the shared PR-author chokepoint — `skills/_shared/github_pr_author.py` resolves an optional bot account from `.three-pillars/config.json`'s `github` block before the `gh pr create` underneath ever runs:
          ```bash
          # Resolve the FREE chokepoint git-toplevel-first (see first-run.md §Resolve a FREE _shared script)
          TOP="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || true)"
          if [ -n "$TOP" ] && [ -f "$TOP"/skills/_shared/resolve_script.py ]; then RS="$TOP"/skills/_shared/resolve_script.py; else RS="$TP_ROOT"/skills/_shared/resolve_script.py; fi
          GHPA="$(python3 "$RS" github_pr_author.py)"
          python3 "$GHPA" create --context manual -- \
            --base {base} --head {current-branch} \
            --title "Complete design: {design-name}" \
            --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
          Archives `three-pillars-docs/tp-designs/{design-name}/` to `three-pillars-docs/completed-tp-designs/{design-name}/` and stamps the completion date on `design.md`.

          Closes the TDD pipeline for this design. Review and merge to land the archival on `{base}`.
          EOF
          )"
          ```
          Repos with no `github.pr_author_account` configured run plain `gh pr create` underneath — byte-identical to today's behavior (ambient `gh` auth; the helper's resolve step returned `None`). A helper exit code of **3** means the configured bot account is unavailable (`BotAuthUnavailable`); surface the helper's actionable stderr to the user and do **not** retry with ambient auth — a silent fallback would re-create the self-approval trap the config exists to prevent.
          - **Light/just-do-it fidelity checklist**: before invoking the helper, read the design's weight class — `python3 "$TP_ROOT"/skills/_shared/weight_class.py read three-pillars-docs/completed-tp-designs/{design-name}` (the dir was archived in step 6c; `read_class` reads design.md's frontmatter). When it returns `light` or `just-do-it`, append the **fidelity checklist** from `skills/_shared/weight-class.md` §Light fidelity checklist to the PR body — paste the checklist block verbatim between the body template's last line and the `EOF`. That checklist (every in-scope item traced to the diff, drift flagged) is the light class's impl-level instrument; the PR body is where the reviewer consumes it. For `full`/`spike` (or the legacy `("full", "default")` read), the body template is unchanged.
          Report the PR URL back to the user.
          - **Request Copilot review** on the new PR (default-on; suppress with `--no-review`) — a completion PR with no reviewer requested is a review loop with nothing to classify (F2). Resolve `{n}` from the created PR URL and request the Copilot bot via the REST `requested_reviewers` endpoint — the known-good path; do **not** use `gh pr edit --add-reviewer` (it fails on classic-Projects repos with a GraphQL deprecation error before the reviewer is added):
            ```bash
            gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}/requested_reviewers \
              -f 'reviewers[]=copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]'
            ```
            **Fail-open** (load-bearing): a non-zero exit must **not** fail the completion — the PR already exists; report the failure and continue. Mirrors `tp-run-full-design` Tier 6; pairs with `copilot-review-custom-instructions` (the `.github/` instructions that make the requested review produce convention-aware comments instead of no-ops). After the review is requested, `/tp-pr-iterate {design-name}` can drive the review loop.
        - If `gh` is not available or auth fails, tell the user the branch is pushed and print a GitHub compare URL they can open in a browser: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/compare/{base}...{current-branch}?expand=1` (derive `{owner}/{repo}` from `git remote get-url origin`).
      - On **no**: leave the commit in place and remind the user how to push + open a PR when ready.
      - **Never merge the PR** from within the skill — review happens on the PR, not inside the skill.
      - **This skill ends at PR-open** — teardown is `/tp-post-merge`'s sole responsibility. After reporting the PR URL, tell the user:
        > After the PR is merged, run `/tp-post-merge {design-name}` to delete the branch and worktree. If you use `/tp-merge-from-main` to sync the base in, its step 8 will auto-chain `/tp-post-merge` automatically once the completion PR has landed.

   h. **Report success** with:
      - The archive location: `three-pillars-docs/completed-tp-designs/{design-name}/`
      - The commit SHA produced in step 6f (short form)
      - The PR URL if one was opened, or the branch name the user still needs to push/PR manually
      - Next step: `/tp-post-merge {design-name}` after the PR is merged (or `/tp-merge-from-main` step 8 auto-chains it)

## Rules
- Use `git mv` for the move so history follows the files.
- Never delete any artifact — `handoff.md` (bannered as an archive marker per step 6a/6d1), design.md, detailed-design.md, plan.md, review.md, implementation-audit.md, `lock.json`, and every other artifact move with the directory. The `lock.json` moves with the directory as a historical record of who held the design; see `skills/_shared/collaboration.md` for the lock convention.
- If `design.md` doesn't exist in the directory, warn but continue with the move (some designs may have non-standard structures).
- If `three-pillars-docs/completed-tp-designs/{design-name}/` already exists, tell the user and stop — don't overwrite a previously completed design.
- The frontmatter block uses YAML between `---` delimiters. "Frontmatter" is metadata at the top of a markdown file — a convention from static site generators like Jekyll and Hugo. Many tools parse it automatically.
- **Commit scope**: stage only the archival paths listed in step 6f **+ the reconcile `--json` file list** (the rewritten cite files from `reconcile_docs.py --archive-cites`). Never use `git add -A` / `git add .` — unrelated WIP must not be swept into the completion commit. If the working tree has unrelated changes, stop before committing and ask the user to handle them first.
- **Commit message**: do not include a Co-Authored-By trailer. The completion commit is a mechanical archival step; the trailer is not appropriate here.
- **Ends at PR-open — teardown is `/tp-post-merge`'s sole responsibility**: this skill opens the PR (or surfaces the compare URL) but never merges it and never deletes the `tp/{design-name}` branch. Post-merge teardown (branch delete, worktree remove, MRU clear) lives exclusively in `/tp-post-merge {design-name}`. `/tp-merge-from-main` step 8 auto-chains it after a successful completion-PR merge. No merge, no branch delete inside this skill.
- **Never bypass hooks**: if `git commit` or `git push` is blocked by a hook, surface the output and stop — do not retry with `--no-verify`.

## Auto Mode

`--auto` is a **Shape B (Generator)** per `skills/_shared/auto-mode.md`. It exists so the autonomous orchestrator (`/tp-run-full-design` Tier 5.6) can archive a finished design unattended — the *archival* half of closeout-before-merge. It performs the mechanical archival and **nothing that needs a human or owns the PR surface**.

In `--auto`:
- **Run the archival half only**: step 6a handoff **preserve** (no delete), step 6b1 `/tp-spec merge {design-name}` (no-op if no `spec-delta.md` — see step 6b1 for the skip rule), step 6c `git mv` to `completed-tp-designs/`, step 6d frontmatter completion **stamp**, step 6d1 handoff **banner** at the archived path (skipped cleanly if no `handoff.md` exists), step 6e Current Focus / Design Inventory rewrite, step 6f `Complete design: {design-name}` **commit** (scoped `git add` of the archival paths including `three-pillars-docs/specs/<domain>/spec.md` if a delta was merged, no Co-Authored-By; **`handoff.md` is NOT staged — it is gitignored and stays local-only, per step 6a/6d1**), and set `phase = "cleanup-pending"` on the archived `lock.json` — so autonomous completions preserve and banner the **local** handoff identically to interactive completions, without committing session state to VCS.
- **The archival commit inherits the step-6f staged-blob guard.** Under `--auto`, `verify_archive_staged.py` runs as the commit's pre-commit self-check exactly as in interactive mode (identical mechanical assertion). On a still-failing exit `1` (double-add did not resolve it) or an exit `2` precondition error, `--auto` logs the abort to `three-pillars-docs/tp-designs/{design-name}/decisions.md` (sanctioned audit-trail write) and exits non-zero for orchestrator escalation — it never commits a stampless / lock-phaseless archive. The unpiped / HEAD-advanced commit check applies identically.
- **Skip step 5 (the confirmation prompt)** — proceed without asking.
- **Skip step 6g (PR)** — `--auto` opens **no PR**, requests **no Copilot review**, and performs no cleanup/teardown of the worktree. PR-opening is always the **caller's** concern: in the orchestrator path, Tier 6 opens the single completion PR (`tp/{slug} → {default}`) *after* this archival commit lands; opening one here would double up. The step-6g Copilot review request rides inside the skipped step 6g — under `--auto` it is never invoked. **In the autonomous path, Tier 6 is the sole initial completion-PR review requester.** (See `tp-run-full-design/SKILL.md` ## Tier 6 § Step 2.) Log exactly one line to `three-pillars-docs/tp-designs/{design-name}/decisions.md` as a sanctioned `--auto` audit-trail write (same class as the BLOCKED-learn logged exception):
  ```
  [tp-design-complete] review-request-deferred-to-tier-6
  ```
  Post-merge cleanup/teardown now lives exclusively in `/tp-post-merge` — setting `cleanup-pending` on the archived lock is what allows the orchestrator or `/tp-merge-from-main` step 8 to chain it automatically after the human merge.
- **Honor the step-3 learn-ran hard-block, without prompting.** It is **auto-satisfied** when `/tp-design-learn` (or `/tp-spike-learn`) ran immediately prior in the same run (orchestrator Slot 9, the normal case). If it is *not* satisfied, **BLOCK**: append a `### [tp-design-complete] BLOCKED — learn-not-run` entry to `three-pillars-docs/tp-designs/{design-name}/decisions.md` and exit non-zero (the orchestrator escalates). Do **not** auto-pass via `--skip-learn` and do **not** prompt.
- **The BLOCK `decisions.md` write is the sanctioned `--auto` audit-trail exception, not silent mutation.** `decisions.md` is the permanent, human-reviewed decision log that *is* the autonomous run's accountability record (see `auto-mode.md`); appending a BLOCKED entry is logging, not the "silent mutation of docs/designs/code without the human merge gate" the vision non-goal forbids. The archival commit itself still lands inside the human-gated completion PR — never auto-merged.
- **Lock**: the directory move carries `lock.json` with it (per `skills/_shared/collaboration.md`), exactly as in interactive mode. The `cleanup-pending` phase is set on the archived lock so `/tp-post-merge` can find and tear down the design after the human merge.

**Contract: in `--auto`, this skill merges any spec delta (no-op if absent) + archives + stamps + rewrites Current Focus + commits (staging the merged base spec if a delta was merged) + sets cleanup-pending, opens no PR, removes no worktree, never prompts, and BLOCKs (logging to `decisions.md`) rather than completing a design whose learn step has not run.**
