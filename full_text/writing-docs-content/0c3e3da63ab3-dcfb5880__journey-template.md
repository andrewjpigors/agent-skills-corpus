# Journey Template Skill

Generate a complete agentic journey from a user's app idea. A journey is a hands-on learning experience where developers use GitHub Copilot (CLI, app, or IDE) to build and deploy an app to Azure.

## Curriculum packaging (required)

**Every journey README must include:**
- No learning-path or stage numbering — journeys are self-contained; link related journeys in What's Next
- Honest first-run time + cost **if left running** + same-day teardown
- **Done when** checklist with concrete manual verification steps
- Full-stack: **one-line default stack** at the first generate prompt (not a defaults table); put stack details in PLAN.md
- Plugin commands: only `microsoft/azure-skills` / `azure@azure-skills`
- What's Next aligned to the path (not renumbered leftovers)
- OSS: shared deploy recipe (location, secrets, probes, resolve issues, issues.md)

Update root `README.md` learning path + journey table when adding a journey.

## Journey Types

| Dimension | Full-Stack (e.g. AIMarket) | OSS Deployment (e.g. n8n, Grafana, Superset) |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **What the learner does** | Builds an app from scratch with GitHub Copilot | Deploys an existing OSS app via `@oss-to-azure-deployer` agent |
| **Files generated** | README.md + PLAN.md | README.md + app-specific skill in `.github/skills/` |
| **README structure** | "The Journey" with 3-5 phases (adapt to app complexity) | "Deploy with the Agent" with 3 steps (Setup → Deploy → Verify) |
| **Time** | 3–5 hours first run (say 2–3 only if re-run) | 15–45 minutes first run |
| **Images** | 4-6 (one per phase boundary) | 2 (hero + deployment) |
| **Unique sections** | "The Spec", "How Agentic AI is Used", one-line default stack at first prompt | "Configuration Reference", "Key Learnings", skip rules if expensive |
| **Compute target** | Container Apps, App Service, Functions, Static Web Apps, AKS | Container Apps, AKS, App Service |

## Output Structure

```
journeys/<app-name>/
├── README.md          # Learner-facing walkthrough
├── PLAN.md            # AI-readable spec (full-stack journeys only)
└── images/            # Generated images (added separately)
```

For OSS deployment journeys, also create an app-specific skill:

```
.github/skills/<app>-azure/
├── SKILL.md              # Overview, quick start, architecture, verification
├── config/
│   ├── environment-variables.md
│   └── health-probes.md
└── troubleshooting.md
```

The SKILL.md needs YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: <app>-azure
description: Deploy <App> to Azure. Use when deploying <App> for <purpose>.
---
```

### OSS Skill SKILL.md Structure

The skill is what the `@oss-to-azure-deployer` agent reads. Follow this section order (reference `n8n-azure` as the primary example):

1. **Overview / When to Use** — one paragraph
2. **Critical: Infrastructure Generation** — infrastructure is generated fresh each deployment via `azure-prepare` plugin, NOT committed to the repo
3. **Critical: Subscription Context** — read the value with `az account show --query id -o tsv`, then pass it to `azd env set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID <subscription-id>` without shell command substitution
4. **Critical: \<App-Specific Gotcha\>** — the #1 deployment failure cause (e.g., PostgreSQL SKU needs both `name` AND `tier`; Bicep outputs MUST use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE)
5. **Official Documentation** — link to app's docs
6. **Quick Start (Verified)** — exact prompt sequence, tested and confirmed
7. **Key Configuration Files** — table pointing to `config/environment-variables.md`, `config/health-probes.md`, `troubleshooting.md`
8. **Architecture** — Mermaid diagram of Azure resources
9. **App-Specific Requirements** — database, networking, storage, ports
10. **Cost Estimate** — table with SKUs and monthly costs
11. **Verification Checklist** — curl / az commands to confirm deployment
12. **Tear Down** — `azd down --force --purge`
13. **Differences from Generic Patterns** — what makes this app non-standard (startup timing, SSL, env vars, ports)

For AKS-based apps (like Superset), also include:
- `references/kubernetes-manifests.md` in the skill directory
- Default credentials section (e.g., admin/admin)
- "Why AKS Instead of Container Apps?" justification in the README
- Resource requirements table (CPU/Memory per pod)

---

## README.md Template

Every journey README MUST follow this exact structure. Reference `journeys/aimarket/README.md` for a full-stack example and `journeys/n8n/README.md` for an OSS deployment example.

### Required Sections (in order)

```markdown
# Agentic Journey NN: <App Name> — <Subtitle>

> ✨ **<One-sentence hook — what makes this journey interesting, not a summary>**

<p align="center">
  <img src="./images/<hero-image>.jpg" alt="<Alt text>" width="800" />
</p>

<1-2 sentence intro. Focus on what the learner will accomplish, not a feature list.>

## Learning Objectives

- <Concrete outcomes: "you'll know how to X" not "use X">

> ⏱️ **Estimated Time**: ~NN minutes

## Deploy with the Agent / The Journey

### Step 1: Setup

<Plugin setup — use these EXACT commands:>

```bash
copilot
```

Once inside the interactive session, add the marketplace (first time only):

```
> /plugin marketplace add microsoft/azure-skills
```

Then install the plugin:

```
> /plugin install azure@azure-skills
```

> **Already installed?** If you completed the root [Quick Start](../../../README.md#quick-start) (or already installed `azure@azure-skills`), skip the install commands — the plugin persists across sessions.
> **Canonical only:** `microsoft/azure-skills` — never document alternate marketplace names.

<For OSS journeys, select the agent:>

```
> /agent
```

Select **`oss-to-azure-deployer`** from the list.

### Step 2: Deploy

<p align="center">

## Configuration Reference (OSS journeys only — full-stack journeys put this in PLAN.md)

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| ... | Yes/No | ... |

### Container Resources

| Setting | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| CPU | 0.5 | ... |

|-------|------|--------|
| Liveness | /api/health | initialDelay: 30s, period: 10s |
| Startup | /api/health | failureThreshold: 10, period: 10s |

---

## Cost Breakdown

| Resource | SKU | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-----|--------------|
| ... | ... | ~$X |
| **Total** | | **~$X-Y/month** |

Use human-readable SKU names (e.g., "Pay-per-GB" not "PerGB2018").

## Troubleshooting

### <Symptom — what the user sees>

**Cause:** <What went wrong>

**Fix:** <How to fix it>

Separate deployment errors from post-deployment usage issues with:
> **Post-Deployment Issues:** The following issues relate to *using* the app after deployment, not the deployment itself.

### Structural Variations by Journey Type

**OSS deployment journeys** use the base template as-is. Section order:

`Deploy with the Agent` (3 steps) → `Configuration Reference` → `Cost Breakdown` → `Troubleshooting` → `Verification Checklist` → `Cleanup` → `Key Learnings` → `Assignment` → `What's Next` → `Resources`

**Full-stack journeys** replace several sections:

| Base Template Section | Full-Stack Replacement |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| `Deploy with the Agent` (3 steps) | `The Journey` (4 phases: Build API → Frontend → AI → Deploy) |
| `Configuration Reference` | Omit — specs live in PLAN.md |
| `Key Learnings` | `How Agentic AI is Used` — table of agentic use cases |

Full-stack journeys also add:
- **"The Spec"** section after Architecture — links to PLAN.md with a note: *"This is a spec for AI agents. You don't need to read it — GitHub Copilot will."*
- **Phase-level images** — one image at each phase boundary (e.g., spec-to-code, storefront, AI features, deployment)
- **Teaching markers** within each phase (🔍 Inspect, 💡 What you're learning, 🧪 Test it yourself)
- **Two deployment options** in final phase: Option A (GitHub Copilot) and Option B (GitHub Copilot cloud agent)

For mobile frontends (iOS/Android), note in the README:
- Backend is deployed to Azure with `azd up`; mobile app runs locally or via TestFlight / Play Store internal testing
- API URL must be configurable (not hardcoded) — use environment config or build schemes
- Mobile app is NOT deployed by azd — only the Azure backend is
- Include device testing instructions (simulator/emulator + physical device)

For AKS deployments (e.g., Superset), add:
- **"Why AKS Instead of Container Apps?"** section after Architecture with architectural justification
- **kubectl-based verification** commands alongside curl commands
- **Complexity note** in the opening if deploy time exceeds 15 minutes

For API-only journeys (no frontend):
- Omit Phase 2 entirely — journey goes straight from API/Backend to Deploy
- Remove `web` service from azure.yaml — single service only
- Skip the frontend rebuild step in the deployment flow
- Verification is curl/API testing only

### Emoji Conventions

Use consistently throughout all journeys:

| Emoji | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| ✨ | Tagline hook (one per journey) |
| ⏱️ | Time estimate |
| 💰 | Cost estimate |
| 📋 | Prerequisites |
| 🔍 | Inspect what was generated (full-stack only) |
| 💡 | Meta-learning insight (full-stack only) |
| 🧪 | Test it yourself (full-stack only) |
| ⚠️ | Warning or critical note |

---

## PLAN.md Template (Full-Stack Journeys Only)

The PLAN.md is a spec document that GitHub Copilot reads to generate code. It is NOT tutorial content. Add a note at the top: "This is a spec for AI agents. You don't need to read it — GitHub Copilot will." Reference `journeys/aimarket/PLAN.md` for the complete example.

### Required Sections

```markdown
# <App Name>: <Subtitle> — Spec

<One-sentence description>. This document is the spec — GitHub Copilot reads it to generate the implementation.

**Out of scope:** <What this app does NOT do>

---

## Choose Your Stack

| | Node.js | Python | .NET | Java |
|---|---------|--------|------|------|
| **Framework** | Express + TypeScript | FastAPI | ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs | Spring Boot |
| **Database** | `better-sqlite3` | `sqlite3` (stdlib) | `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` | `JdbcTemplate` + SQLite |

<Adapt this table to your journey's stack. Not limited to these — Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, etc. are also valid choices.>

Frontend: React, Angular, Vue, Swift/SwiftUI (iOS), Kotlin/Jetpack Compose (Android), React Native, Flutter, or none for API-only journeys. Deploy backend with **azd** + **Bicep using Azure Verified Modules (AVM)**.

## Project Structure

<Adapt phases to your app. Not all phases are required — omit Frontend for API-only apps, omit AI for apps without AI features. The final phase is always Deploy.>

## Phase 1: API / Backend
### Data Access Layer (repository pattern — interfaces → implementations → factory)
### Data Models (with field types, constraints, and validation)
### Endpoints (with request/response JSON examples — VALIDATE ALL JSON IS VALID)
### Error Response Format (status codes, error codes, response schema)
### Seed Data (exact IDs, descriptions, image URLs)

## Phase 2: Frontend / Mobile Client (omit for API-only apps)
### Pages/Screens and Components
### State Management
### API Client
### Platform-Specific Notes (mobile only — Xcode setup, Android Studio, signing, etc.)

## Phase 3: AI Features (omit if not applicable)
### AI Feature 1: <Name>
### AI Feature 2: <Name>
### Environment Variables

## Phase N (final): Deploy to Azure
### Containerization (Dockerfiles, or Functions/App Service config if serverless)
### Azure Resources (AVM modules — list each resource with its module path)
### Bicep Requirements (list every deployment gotcha discovered during testing)
### Deployment (two-stage flow if frontend needs API URL at build time)
### Mobile Distribution (mobile only — TestFlight, Google Play internal testing, API URL configuration)
### Known Deployment Gotchas (document real failures — soft-deleted resources, SKU issues, etc.)
```

Key rules for PLAN.md:
- **Validate ALL JSON** — every request/response example must be valid JSON (check closing brackets)
- **Seed data must be complete** — exact IDs, names, descriptions, prices, image URLs
- **Error format** — specify the exact error response schema the API should return
- **Deployment gotchas** — document every real failure encountered during testing with the fix
- **Model references** — use gpt-5-mini as primary model, gpt-4.1 as fallback
- **Data access** — if the app supports multiple database backends, reference the `data-access-abstraction` skill for the repository pattern

---

## Deployment Patterns

### azure.yaml Structure

```yaml
name: <app-name>
metadata:
  template: <app-name>@0.0.1
services:
  api:
    project: ./api
    host: containerapp
    language: ts
    docker:
      path: ./Dockerfile
  web:
    project: ./client
    host: containerapp
    language: ts
    docker:
      path: ./Dockerfile
infra:
  provider: bicep
  path: ./infra
```

Supported `host` values: `containerapp`, `aks`, `appservice`, `function`, `staticwebapp`, `springapp`. Choose based on your app's compute needs.

### Dockerfile Patterns

**API (Node.js with native deps):**
```dockerfile
FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM node:24-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
RUN apk add --no-cache python3 make g++
COPY package.json package-lock.json* ./
RUN if [ -f package-lock.json ]; then npm ci; else npm install; fi
COPY . .
RUN npx tsc -p tsconfig.json

FROM node:24-alpine
WORKDIR /app
RUN apk add --no-cache python3 make g++
COPY package.json package-lock.json* ./
RUN if [ -f package-lock.json ]; then npm ci --omit=dev; else npm install --omit=dev; fi
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

- `.dockerignore`: exclude `node_modules`, `dist`, `*.db`, `.env`. Do NOT exclude `tsconfig.json`.

**API (Python/FastAPI):**
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

FROM python:3.12-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/bin /usr/local/bin
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

- `.dockerignore`: exclude `__pycache__`, `*.pyc`, `.venv`, `*.db`, `.env`.

**Client (React/Vite SPA):**
```dockerfile
FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM node:24-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json* ./
RUN if [ -f package-lock.json ]; then npm ci; else npm install; fi
ARG VITE_API_URL
ENV VITE_API_URL=$VITE_API_URL
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

- `ARG` + `ENV` MUST come BEFORE `npm run build` or the build arg is silently ignored.
- `.dockerignore`: exclude `node_modules`, `dist`, `.env`.

**nginx.conf (SPA routing):**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html;
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

NO `/api/` proxy block. Each Container App has its own public URL.

For other languages (.NET, Java, Go, etc.), follow the same multi-stage pattern: builder image for compilation → lean runtime image for production. Adapt the base image, package manager, build command, and runtime command for your stack.

### Full Deployment Flow

```
1. Generate azure.yaml with hooks.postdeploy when SPA needs API URL at build time
2. azd env set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID + azd up
3. postdeploy hook rebuilds frontend (VITE_API_URL) automatically — do not make first success manual
4. Verify the deployed health endpoint and core user flow
5. azd down --force --purge when lab is done
```

If the frontend bakes in a backend URL at build time, always generate `infra/hooks/postdeploy.js` from the `container-apps-deployment` skill and reference it directly from `azure.yaml`. A filtered service deployment may skip project-level hooks, so document direct `node infra/hooks/postdeploy.js` execution. API-only apps skip postdeploy.

**Any ARM64 host:** Prefer an ACR remote build targeting `linux/amd64`. If a local cross-build is required, verify Buildx and emulation during preflight, keep static builder stages on `$BUILDPLATFORM`, and never install privileged QEMU/binfmt automatically.

### Pre-Deployment Requirements (once per subscription)

```bash
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.App
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationalInsights
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL    # if using PostgreSQL
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService   # if using AKS
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.CognitiveServices  # if using AI services
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Search             # if using AI Search
```

### AKS Deployment Pattern

For apps requiring Kubernetes (e.g., Superset with multiple pods, init containers, or complex networking):

```yaml
# azure.yaml for AKS
name: <app-name>
metadata:
  template: <app-name>@0.0.1
services:
  app:
    project: ./src
    host: aks
    language: py    # varies by stack
    docker:
      path: ./Dockerfile
infra:
  provider: bicep
  path: ./infra
```

AKS-specific infrastructure needs:
- **AKS cluster**: `br/public:avm/res/container-service/managed-cluster`
- **Node pool sizing**: D2s_v3 (2 vCores, 8GB) is the minimum practical size (~$85/month each)
- **Standard Load Balancer**: required for public access (~$18/month)
- **Kubernetes manifests**: Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, Secret
- **kubectl verification**: `kubectl get pods`, `kubectl logs`, `kubectl port-forward`
- **Init containers**: for database migrations (e.g., `superset db upgrade`)

### Cross-Platform Post-Provision Hooks

Use a hook when configuration needs a value available only after provisioning. Place JavaScript or TypeScript hooks in `infra/hooks/` and reference them directly from `azure.yaml`:

```yaml
hooks:
  postprovision:
    run: ./infra/hooks/postprovision.js
```

For example, n8n's `WEBHOOK_URL` depends on the Container App URL. The CommonJS `.js` hook resolves paths with `__dirname`, reads outputs with `azd env get-value`, and invokes Azure CLI through `execFileSync()` or `spawnSync()` argument arrays. It must not use Bash variables, PowerShell variables, `chmod`, pipelines, or interpolated shell strings.

---

## Bicep Patterns

### AVM Modules

Always use Azure Verified Modules from `br/public:avm/...`. Common modules:

| Resource | Module |
|----------|--------|
| **Compute** | |
| Container Apps Env | `br/public:avm/res/app/managed-environment` |
| Container Apps | `br/public:avm/res/app/container-app` |
| AKS | `br/public:avm/res/container-service/managed-cluster` |
| App Service Plan | `br/public:avm/res/web/serverfarm` |
| App Service / Functions | `br/public:avm/res/web/site` |
| Static Web App | `br/public:avm/res/web/static-site` |
| **Data** | |
| PostgreSQL Flexible | `br/public:avm/res/db-for-postgre-sql/flexible-server` |
| Azure SQL | `br/public:avm/res/sql/server` |
| Cosmos DB | `br/public:avm/res/document-db/database-account` |
| Redis Cache | `br/public:avm/res/cache/redis` |
| Storage Account | `br/public:avm/res/storage/storage-account` |
| **AI** | |
| AI Search | `br/public:avm/res/search/search-service` |
| AI Foundry | `br/public:avm/ptn/ai-ml/ai-foundry` |
| **Infrastructure** | |
| Monitoring | `br/public:avm/ptn/azd/monitoring` |
| Container Registry | `br/public:avm/res/container-registry/registry` |
| Key Vault | `br/public:avm/res/key-vault/vault` |
| Service Bus | `br/public:avm/res/service-bus/namespace` |

Browse the full AVM catalog: https://azure.github.io/Azure-Verified-Modules/indexes/bicep/

### Managed-Identity ACR Pattern

Don't enable the ACR admin account or pass registry passwords to Container Apps. Use the registry login server as a normal output, then use a two-phase deployment:

1. Provision each Container App with a public placeholder image and system-assigned identity.
2. Assign `AcrPull` on the registry to that identity.
3. Configure the Container App registry entry with the ACR login server and `identity: 'system'`.
4. Deploy the private image only after the role and registry configuration exist.

Some `azd` versions perform the registry step automatically and others don't. Verification must inspect the live Container App registry configuration before declaring success. Use resource-group-scoped wrapper modules only for services that genuinely require `listKeys()`; ACR image pulls don't require admin credentials.

### Required Bicep Settings

- **`azd-service-name` tags** on each container app — azd maps services by these tags
- **Container App startup probe:** `failureThreshold` max is 10 (not 30) with the AVM module
- **AI Search:** SKU `basic`, `disableLocalAuth: false`, `semanticSearch: 'free'`
- **AI Services (Foundry):** `disableLocalAuth: false`, system-assigned managed identity, `allowProjectManagement: true`
- **Raw Foundry fallback:** Deploy the account first, then deploy model children from a nested Bicep module that receives the created account name; do not race account and model creation
- **Entra-admin inputs:** Preflight and persist the complete principal ID, login, and type group, with separate `User` and `ServicePrincipal` handling
- **Azure SQL firewall names:** Use neutral names such as `AllowAzureServices`; avoid reserved words such as `WINDOWS`
- **Container Apps:** `zoneRedundant: false` for regions that don't support it (e.g., West US)
- **Outputs:** Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT`)
- **PostgreSQL SKU:** Include both `name` AND `tier` — omitting tier causes deployment failure
- **`uniqueString()` module parameters:** Add `@minLength(13)` and `@maxLength(13)` when passing the token across a module boundary

### Soft-Deleted Cognitive Services

If a previous deployment was torn down, AI Services resources are soft-deleted for 48 hours and block re-creation. Before redeploying:

```bash
az cognitiveservices account list-deleted
az cognitiveservices account purge --name <name> --resource-group <rg> --location <location>
```

## Teaching Markers (Full-Stack Journeys)

Place these after each GitHub Copilot generation step:

**🔍 Inspect** — immediately after generation, tell the learner exactly what to check:
```markdown
**🔍 Inspect what was generated:**
Open the order creation route. Look for:
1. Does it validate that all product IDs exist and are active?
2. Does it check inventory before creating the order?
3. Does it capture `priceAtPurchase` from the product's current price (not the request)?
```

**💡 What you're learning** — explain the meta-skill:
```markdown
**💡 What you're learning:** Complex business logic is where AI generation needs the most
human review. GitHub Copilot gets CRUD right but often misses multi-step validation.
```

**🧪 Try it yourself** — portable verification with a generated Node.js script:
````markdown
**🧪 Test it yourself:**
```text
node scripts/verify-api.mjs
```
````

---

## Writing Rules

### Opening Hook
- Lead with what the learner gets, not what the app is
- Bad: "In this journey, you'll deploy X, a Y platform, to Azure..."
- Good: "Want Y on Azure without writing Bicep? Tell an agent what you want and it deploys it in 20 minutes."

### Time Estimates
- Be honest about **first run** (include fix loops)
- OSS deployments: 15–45 minutes first run
- Full-stack builds: 3–5 hours first run

### Cost Callouts
- Always show cost in the prereqs box as **if left running**, plus same-day teardown
- For expensive journeys ($100+/month or AKS ~$200), bold skip/budget guidance
- Use human-readable SKU names (not "PerGB2018")

### Tone
- Conversational and direct, like a senior dev pair-programming with you
- No AI-generated filler: "crucial", "comprehensive", "leverage", "seamless", "fostering"
- No "In this agentic journey, you'll..." opening pattern
- Use "you" not "the learner" or "the developer"

### Copilot Naming
- Narrative / learner instructions: **"GitHub Copilot"** (works for CLI, app, or IDE)
- Terminal product only when showing `copilot` or CLI-only notes: **"GitHub Copilot CLI"** or **"Copilot CLI"**
- In GitHub (issues/PRs): **"GitHub Copilot cloud agent"**
- Never bare **"Copilot"** without qualifier

### Images
- Hero image at top, deployment architecture image before deploy step
- Titles in dark navy (#1e3a5f), tight placement (minimal whitespace)
- Optimize: 1200px max width, JPEG quality 80, progressive, <100KB each

---

## Repo Integration

After creating a new journey, update these files:

1. **Root `README.md`** — Agentic journeys table (what you'll do, cost — no time column; time estimates live in the journey README header only)

2. **`AGENTS.md`** — project structure and skills table

3. **Root prerequisites** — only tools common to ALL journeys (Azure CLI, azd, GitHub Copilot, Git). Language runtimes and Docker/kubectl go in the journey's additional prerequisites.

4. **No journey numbering** — journeys are self-contained with no prescribed order. Do not add "Journey N of M", stage numbers, or path-completion language anywhere.

5. **Images** — generate with the `technical-image-generator` skill using the established palette:
   - White background, soft light blue and gray accents
   - Titles in dark navy (#1e3a5f) Helvetica Bold 42pt
   - Optimize: 1200px max width, JPEG quality 80, progressive, <100KB each

---

## Checklist

Before considering a journey complete:

### Content & Quality

- [ ] Opening hook passes the "does a developer care yet?" test
- [ ] Time estimate is honest first-run (tested)
- [ ] Cost "if left running" + same-day teardown called out
- [ ] No path/stage numbering anywhere in the README
- [ ] Done when checklist + verify script where applicable
- [ ] Full-stack: one-line default stack at first generate prompt (details live in PLAN.md)
- [ ] No bare "Copilot" — use "GitHub Copilot" in narrative; "GitHub Copilot CLI" / "cloud agent" only when product-specific
- [ ] No AI-generated filler words or summary paragraphs
- [ ] All JSON examples are valid (check closing brackets!)
- [ ] SKU names are human-readable in cost tables (not "PerGB2018")
- [ ] gpt-5-mini is primary model (fallback to gpt-4.1)
- [ ] Images optimized (1200px, JPEG, <100KB)

### Structure & Sections

- [ ] Architecture diagram shows all Azure resources
- [ ] Plugin setup: only `microsoft/azure-skills` / `azure@azure-skills`
- [ ] Troubleshooting covers real errors from actual deployments (Symptom/Cause/Fix format)
- [ ] Assignment guides discovery (do → observe → ask agent → fix)
- [ ] Cleanup section with `azd down --force --purge`
- [ ] What's Next lists related journeys as plain links (no path/completion language)
- [ ] OSS journeys: Configuration Reference section (env vars, container resources, health probes)
- [ ] OSS journeys: Key Learnings (4-5 max) don't repeat troubleshooting content
- [ ] Full-stack journeys: "The Spec" section linking to PLAN.md
- [ ] Full-stack journeys: Teaching markers (🔍, 💡, 🧪) in each phase
- [ ] Full-stack journeys: "How Agentic AI is Used" section with use case table

### Deployment & Infrastructure

- [ ] `azd-service-name` tags on all container apps in Bicep
- [ ] Pre-deployment provider registration commands included
- [ ] `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` set explicitly before `azd up`
- [ ] VITE_API_URL handled via **postdeploy hook** (if React frontend) — not manual-only first success
- [ ] Soft-deleted Cognitive Services warning (if using AI services)
- [ ] Platform flag `--platform linux/amd64` documented (if Docker builds)
- [ ] Windows, macOS, and Linux prerequisite and command paths reviewed
- [ ] Stateful verification uses portable scripts or paired Bash and PowerShell examples
- [ ] Browser verification uses Playwright's bundled Chromium
- [ ] Required lifecycle hooks are CommonJS `.js` or `.ts`, not unsupported `.mjs` or host-specific `.sh`/`.ps1`
- [ ] Wrapper module pattern used for resources needing `listKeys()` (if subscription-scoped)
- [ ] Health probe timing tested with actual startup time

### Repo Integration

- [ ] Journey added to root README journey table
- [ ] AGENTS.md updated (project structure + skills table)
- [ ] Additional prerequisites in journey README (not root)
