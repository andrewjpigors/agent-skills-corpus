# GHCP SDK Hosted Agents on Foundry

Deploy Foundry hosted agents using the **GitHub Copilot SDK** with BYOK
(Bring Your Own Key) authentication. No `GITHUB_TOKEN` required. Uses the
**Invocations protocol** (GA, version `2.0.0`) with SSE streaming for
unlimited tool-loop duration.

> **GA migration (v2.0.0).** This skill now uses the unified single-file
> `azure.yaml` deploy shape shared with `foundry-hosted-agents` — the old
> two-file `agent.yaml` + separately-wired `azure.yaml` contract, the
> remote-build/manual `services:` wiring, the tenant-ID-env deploy hook,
> and the manual account-scope `Foundry User` role grant are all retired.
> See § "azure.yaml (unified GA deployment)" and § "Identity & RBAC for
> hosted agents" below.

## When to Use GHCP SDK Instead of MAF

| Consideration | MAF | GHCP SDK |
|---------------|-----|----------|
| **Auth** | `DefaultAzureCredential` → `FoundryChatClient` | BYOK: `DefaultAzureCredential` → bearer token |
| **Protocol** | Responses API (request/response) | Invocations (SSE streaming) |
| **Tool loop limit** | ~120s (Foundry gateway timeout) | ♾️ (SSE keeps connection alive) |
| **Per-query overhead** | Low (1-3 internal turns) | High (20-34 internal tool calls per query) |
| **Skill discovery** | `SkillsProvider.from_paths()` (recommended) **OR** inline concat (legacy) | `SkillsProvider` (default) |
| **Custom tools** | `@tool` decorator | Not supported (use MCP servers instead) |
| **Toolbox** | `MCPStreamableHTTPTool` (was `client.get_toolbox()`, removed 1.3.0) | Not directly available |
| **Maturity** | Production-proven | Validated (identical eval scores) |

**Use GHCP SDK when:**
- Slow tools mask the per-query overhead: web scraping, long-running tools, or multi-site scans.
- You need streaming progress events to the caller for workflows that run beyond the ~120s Responses gateway limit.
- The workload looks like **bat-scraper**: Playwright/tool calls take 30-60s each, so GHCP SDK orchestration overhead is acceptable.

**Use MAF when:**
- Tools are fast: data queries, MCP retrieval, or single-shot tools where orchestration overhead dominates latency.
- You need the faster runtime path; field measurements show MAF at **~19s** vs GHCP SDK at **>220s** for the same fast-MCP workload (~10x faster).
- Agent needs custom `@tool` functions, Foundry Toolbox (`web_search`, `code_interpreter`), or simpler deployment.

---

## ⚠️ Performance Caveat: Per-Query Overhead

Each `CopilotClient` query generates **20-34 internal tool calls** for planning,
skill discovery, tool selection, and related orchestration.
That happens regardless of how many user-facing tool calls the agent actually makes.
The overhead lives in `CopilotClient` itself; `SkillsProvider` is **NOT** the cause.
Removing `SkillsProvider` does not eliminate the extra internal turns.
Field measurement on an identical agent (`gpt-5.4`, same MCP tool set, same query)
ran in **~19s on MAF** but **>220s on GHCP SDK** when MCP tools were fast.
The overhead is masked when tools are slow: bat-scraper Playwright calls take
30-60s each, so 20 internal calls vanish in the noise.
Decision rule: if your slowest tool is <2s, you almost certainly want MAF.
If your slowest tool is >30s and you need streaming progress events to the caller,
GHCP SDK is the better fit.

> **Note on `SkillsProvider` cost (both runtimes).** `SkillsProvider` is
> **not** GHCP-only — MAF supports it equally well via
> `context_providers=[skills_provider]` (see `foundry-hosted-agents`
> § Skill Loading). On both runtimes, `SkillsProvider` itself adds only
> **+1 `load_skill` round-trip per skill the agent activates per query**
> (typically 1-3 per query). The 20-34-call overhead above is the
> `CopilotClient` runtime, an entirely separate concern.

---

## Runtime Pattern (GHCP SDK + Invocations)

**Copy the reference template** at `references/container.py` into the project root.
Then adapt `_load_mcp_servers()` for your MCP server configuration.

The template provides:
1. `_init_byok()` / `_get_provider()` — BYOK auth with `DefaultAzureCredential`
2. `_ensure_session()` — Creates/resumes `CopilotClient` session with provider, skills, MCP
3. `_stream_response()` — Subscribes to session events, yields SSE
4. `handle_invoke()` — `@app.invoke_handler` that returns `StreamingResponse`

```
container.py → CopilotClient + InvocationAgentServerHost → port 8088
  ├── BYOK auth (ai.azure.com scope)
  ├── Skills via skill_directories parameter
  ├── MCP servers via mcp_servers parameter
  └── SSE streaming (no timeout on long tool loops)
```

**Key points:**
- `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` is **injected by the platform** — never declare it
  under the `azure.yaml` agent service's `environmentVariables` list (see
  § "azure.yaml (unified GA deployment)")
- BYOK scope is `https://ai.azure.com/.default` — NOT `cognitiveservices.azure.com`
- Token is static per session — `_get_provider()` mints fresh token each session creation
- `working_directory` should be `$HOME` (hosted agents sandbox filesystem at home dir)
- `system_message` requires dict format: `{"mode": "replace", "content": "..."}`
- `PermissionHandler.approve_all` auto-approves tool calls (required for unattended agents)

---

## Why Invocations Protocol (Not Responses)

The GHCP SDK can also run behind `ResponsesHostServer` using `GitHubCopilotAgent`:

```python
# ⚠️ This pattern DOES NOT WORK for long tool loops on Foundry
from agent_framework_foundry_hosting import ResponsesHostServer
from agent_framework.github import GitHubCopilotAgent

agent = GitHubCopilotAgent(...)
server = ResponsesHostServer(agent)
server.run()
```

**Why it fails:** `GitHubCopilotAgent.send_and_wait()` blocks until the full response
completes. Default timeout is 60s (configurable). But **Foundry's gateway has a ~120s
hard timeout** on non-streaming responses. Any tool-heavy workflow (web scraping,
multi-site scanning) taking >120s returns a gateway timeout.

**Invocations protocol solves this:** SSE events stream continuously, keeping the
connection alive. A query using 50+ tool calls over 5 minutes works perfectly because
events flow throughout.

| Approach | Max Duration | Why |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| ResponsesHostServer + send_and_wait | ~120s | Foundry gateway timeout on non-streaming |
| InvocationAgentServerHost + SSE | Unlimited | Events stream continuously |

**Critical:** the `azure.yaml` agent service must declare `protocol: invocations`
only — do **not** add a `responses` protocol entry. `InvocationAgentServerHost`
only serves `/invocations`; the `/responses` path returns 404 even if declared.
See the troubleshooting row **"responses protocol not declared" (bot 400)** —
dual protocols don't work. **WHY:** `InvocationAgentServerHost` is the only
server type the GHCP SDK runtime ships with; serving Responses requires
switching to the MAF runtime (`ResponsesHostServer`) entirely. External
callers (bot, eval scripts) must POST to the Invocations SSE endpoint
directly, or use `azd ai agent invoke --protocol invocations`. If you need
`oai.responses.create()` for a Teams bot, use MAF runtime instead.

---

## pyproject.toml

**Copy** `references/pyproject.toml` into your project root and update `name` and `version`.

**Notes:**
- `github-copilot-sdk` provides `CopilotClient`, session management, event types
- `azure-ai-agentserver-invocations` provides `InvocationAgentServerHost`
- `azure-ai-agentserver-core` pinned EXACT (`==2.0.0b7`) — it's a transitive dep of `-invocations` declared as `>=2.0.0b7` (unbounded upper); the exact pin stops a future core `b8+` from silently breaking fresh container builds
- `azure-identity` pinned to avoid pulling beta versions
- `prerelease = "if-necessary-or-explicit"` needed for beta agentserver package

---

## Dockerfile

**Copy** `references/Dockerfile` into your project root. No changes needed for most agents.

## BYOK Authentication Deep Dive

BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) lets `CopilotClient` use your Foundry model deployment
instead of GitHub's hosted models. No `GITHUB_TOKEN` needed.

### How It Works

```
CopilotClient.create_session(provider={...})
  └── Routes LLM calls to your Foundry project endpoint
      └── Uses bearer token from DefaultAzureCredential
          └── Scope: https://ai.azure.com/.default
```

### Provider Configuration

`copilot.ProviderConfig` is a `TypedDict` — at runtime it produces a
plain `dict`, so the "class" form and the "dict" form below are byte-identical
runtime objects. Use the class form when you want IDE / typing help; use the
dict form when you want a one-liner.

What actually matters is the **values**: `type="azure"` + bare endpoint is the
PRIMARY shape (matches the official Microsoft sample, ~2-3× faster); the
legacy `type="openai"` + `/openai/v1/` is still accepted for backward compat.

```python
# RECOMMENDED — class form (TypedDict), gives you typing + IDE completion.
from copilot import ProviderConfig

provider = ProviderConfig(
    type="azure",                          # SDK adds api-version itself
    base_url=FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT,             # BARE project endpoint — no /openai/v1/
    wire_api="responses",
    bearer_token=token.token,              # from DefaultAzureCredential
)
```

```python
# LEGACY — same wire shape, type='openai' kept for backward compat (2-3× slower).
provider = {
    "type": "openai",
    "base_url": f"{FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT}/openai/v1/",  # must end with /openai/v1/
    "bearer_token": token.token,
    "wire_api": "responses",
}
```

### Provider shape decision matrix

Measured against `gpt-5.4-mini` on a live Foundry project (May 2026):

| `type` | `base_url` suffix | Result | Latency |
|--------|-------------------|--------|---------|
| `"azure"` | bare endpoint | ✅ **Recommended** | ~2.6s |
| `"azure"` | `/openai/v1/` | ✅ Works | ~7.9s |
| `"openai"` | `/openai/v1/` | ✅ Legacy compat | ~6.9s |
| `"openai"` | bare endpoint | ❌ `400 Missing api-version` | n/a |

`github-copilot-sdk` `1.0.1` (GA, this skill) and prior `0.3.0` / `1.0.0b*`
preview lines all accept both `type="azure"` and the legacy
`type="openai"` shapes; the legacy dict form is preserved across releases
for backward compatibility. The 1.0 GA constructor is flat — pass
`github_token=...` directly to `CopilotClient(...)` (no `SubprocessConfig`
wrapper; `auto_start` kwarg removed — call `await client.start()` explicitly).
The public import surface as of the GA release is
`from copilot import CopilotClient, PermissionHandler, ProviderConfig` and
`from copilot.session_events import SessionEventType` (matches the official
Microsoft sample's `main.py`) — see `references/container.py`.

### Common BYOK Mistakes

| Mistake | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Wrong scope | 401 Unauthorized | Use `ai.azure.com` not `cognitiveservices.azure.com` |
| `type="openai"` + bare endpoint | `400 Missing api-version` | Either switch to `type="azure"` + bare, or append `/openai/v1/` |
| Token not refreshed | 401 after ~1h | Mint fresh token per session in `_get_provider()` |
| Permission error during deploy or invoke | 403 / `PermissionDenied` | Hard FAIL except the exact immediate-post-active readiness envelope documented under § "Invoking the Agent". That narrow case retries the same path; all others require root-cause investigation. Never grant roles to route around it |

---

## CopilotClient Session Parameters

```python
# Recommended pattern (matches official Microsoft sample): explicit start().
# As of github-copilot-sdk 1.0 GA, CopilotClient takes flat kwargs — no
# SubprocessConfig wrapper, no auto_start. Construct, then await start().
client = CopilotClient()
await client.start()

session = await client.create_session(
    provider=provider,                    # ProviderConfig OR dict — see "Provider Configuration"
    model="gpt-5.4-mini",                 # Foundry model deployment name
    system_message={                      # MUST be dict, not string
        "mode": "replace",
        "content": "You are a helpful assistant.",
    },
    skill_directories=["/app/skills"],    # Paths to SKILL.md directories
    mcp_servers=[                         # MCP server configs (list[dict] or dict[str, dict])
        {"name": "playwright", "url": "https://my-mcp.azurecontainerapps.io/mcp"},
    ],
    working_directory=str(Path.home()),   # Must be $HOME for hosted agents
    streaming=True,                       # Enable streaming events
    on_permission_request=PermissionHandler.approve_all,  # Auto-approve tools
)
```

### Session Event Types

| Event Type | Meaning | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| `SESSION_IDLE` | Response complete | Stop streaming, yield `done` event |
| `SESSION_ERROR` | Agent error | Yield error event, stop |
| `assistant.message` | Final assistant response | Contains full response text |
| `assistant.message_delta` | Streaming content chunk | Accumulate for progressive display |
| `assistant.streaming_delta` | Raw streaming delta | Lower-level than message_delta |
| `assistant.reasoning` | Reasoning trace | Full reasoning block |
| `assistant.reasoning_delta` | Reasoning chunk | Streaming reasoning |
| `tool.execution_start` | Tool call started | Log for debugging |
| `tool.execution_complete` | Tool call finished | Log for debugging |
| `assistant.turn_start` | New turn | Track turn count |
| `assistant.turn_end` | Turn complete | May have more turns |

---

## Invoking the Agent

**Primary path — `azd ai agent invoke`.** Per the current GA CLI (verified
against a locally installed `azure.ai.agents` `1.0.0-beta.4` extension),
`azd ai agent invoke` DOES wrap the positional message argument correctly
and accepts a raw JSON payload for the Invocations protocol:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke "<agent-name>" '{"input": "Say hello in one short sentence."}' \
  --protocol invocations \
  --output raw \
  --timeout 180
```

- `--protocol invocations` selects the Invocations protocol (the CLI
  defaults to `responses` otherwise)
- `--output raw` (or `-o raw`) dumps the unmodified server response
  (status line, headers, body) — the SSE `data:` lines are visible verbatim,
  which is what you want to grep for `assistant.message` /
  `assistant.message_delta`
- `--timeout <seconds>` (or `-t`) bounds the request; the CLI default is
  1800s, which is far longer than most smoke/CI budgets need

Immediately after a new version becomes `active`, the first model call can
briefly return an HTTP-200 SSE readiness envelope while the platform's
implicit agent permission finishes propagating. The exception is exact and
has these guards:

1. The first recognized auth failure must be a `model.call_failure` event
   with `statusCode: 401` whose
   `PermissionDenied` error contains both
   `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/OpenAI/responses/write` and
   `POST /openai/v1/responses`.
2. After that anchor, subsequent generic 401 `PermissionDenied`
   `model.call_failure` events and `session.info` events containing
   `transient_auth_error` may interleave. At least one transient-info event
   is required. The anchor must not repeat; a repeated anchored failure is
   outside the observed readiness envelope and remains a hard failure.
3. The envelope must end with a terminal error containing
   `Authentication failed with provider` and
   `HTTP 401`.

Observed streams may include benign `session.usage_info` and
`assistant.turn_end` lifecycle events inside the recognized envelope. The SSE
epilogue is a separate `event: done` frame whose JSON payload contains a
non-empty string `invocation_id`; accept it only after assistant success or
the recognized provider-auth terminal. Untyped data outside that done frame,
unknown typed events inside the envelope, or a malformed done payload remain
hard failures.

If assistant output arrives after the recognized provider-auth terminal, it
establishes recovered assistant output. Only after that recovery may
`session.usage_info` and `assistant.turn_end` follow before the exact done
frame. Those lifecycle events before assistant recovery do not convert the
terminal failure into success.

Only that complete immediate-post-active sequence is retryable. Retry the
**same JSON positional invoke path** with bounded backoff (six attempts,
15 seconds between attempts). Do not switch invocation methods and do not
add a role grant. Missing, malformed, reordered, or unrelated terminal
events remain a hard failure.

> The older claim that `azd ai agent invoke` "does not wrap user input" was
> a pre-GA defect specific to earlier preview builds. It does not reproduce
> against the current GA CLI and is retired from this skill — do not carry
> it forward into new guidance.

### Via curl or the reference script (advanced/optional)

For callers that need to parse the raw SSE stream directly (e.g. wiring a
bot integration rather than a one-off smoke test), use
`references/invoke_agent.py` as a library or standalone script:

```bash
export AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT="https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>"
export AGENT_NAME="my-agent"
python references/invoke_agent.py "What is the capital of France?"
```

The `invoke_invocations()` function POSTs to
`{endpoint}/agents/{agent_name}/endpoint/protocols/invocations?api-version=v1`
(GA endpoint API version literal `v1` — no `Foundry-Features` preview
header) and parses both `assistant.message` and `assistant.message_delta`
events, preferring the complete message when available.

**Important:** Always parse both event types. Some responses only emit deltas
without a final complete message event.

---

## Evaluation

### Two-Phase Eval (Invocations Protocol)

Foundry eval SDK's `azure_ai_agent` target does not route to hosted agent endpoints.
Use a two-phase workaround:

1. **Invoke**: Call the agent via Invocations endpoint, collect responses
2. **Score**: Submit query+response pairs to Foundry evaluators

### Eval Data Format for Task Adherence

Task Adherence evaluates whether the agent followed its system instructions.
Include the system message in conversation array format:

```python
eval_item = {
    "query": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "Your system prompt here..."},
        {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "User question"}]},
    ],
    "response": [
        {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Agent response"}]},
    ],
}
```

### Eval Judge Model Sensitivity

| Judge Model | Task Adherence | Other Evaluators |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| `gpt-5.4` | **7%** (overly strict) | Stable |
| `gpt-5.4-mini` | **86%** (accurate) | Stable |

**Always use `gpt-5.4-mini`** as the judge model for Task Adherence.
`gpt-5.4` penalizes responses for claiming tool usage that can't be verified
from response-only data. All other evaluators (Coherence, Intent Resolution,
Task Completion) are stable across both judge models.

### Validated Scores (14-query benchmark)

| Evaluator | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Coherence** | 100% | Identical to MAF |
| **Intent Resolution** | 100% | Identical to MAF |
| **Task Adherence** | 86% | Identical to MAF (gpt-5.4-mini judge) |
| **Task Completion** | 64% | Identical to MAF |
| **Tool Usage (URLs)** | 100% | All responses contain source URLs |

---

## azure.yaml (unified GA deployment)

The old **two-file** contract (`agent.yaml` + a separately hand-wired
`azure.yaml`) is gone. A single `azure.yaml` at the project root is now the
source of truth for both the Foundry project/model deployment and the
hosted agent itself — declared as a graph of `services`, each with a `host`
field and a `uses` list of dependencies. This is the same unified shape
`foundry-hosted-agents` uses, adapted for the GHCP SDK's Invocations
protocol instead of MAF's Responses protocol.

> **MUST:** Copy verbatim from [`references/yaml/azure.yaml`](references/yaml/azure.yaml). Do NOT redefine inline — the validator enforces single-source-of-truth. That file is the canonical `azure.ai.project` + `azure.ai.agent` service pair for a container-built GHCP SDK hosted agent connecting to a **pre-provisioned** Foundry project.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-dev/main/schemas/v1.0/azure.yaml.json
name: my-agent-project

requiredVersions:
  extensions:
    azure.ai.agents: '>=1.0.0-beta.4'

services:
  ai-project:
    host: azure.ai.project
    # Point at an EXISTING project instead of provisioning a new one.
    endpoint: ${FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT}

  my-agent:
    host: azure.ai.agent
    project: .
    language: docker
    uses:
      - ai-project
    kind: hosted
    name: my-agent
    protocols:
      - protocol: invocations
        version: 2.0.0
    environmentVariables:
      - name: AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME
        value: ${AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}
    container:
      resources:
        cpu: "1"
        memory: 2Gi

infra:
  provider: microsoft.foundry
```

### Critical rules

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| `kind: hosted` on the `azure.ai.agent` service | Marks it as a containerized/source-built hosted agent (as opposed to a Foundry Agent Service prompt agent) |
| Protocol `invocations`, version `2.0.0` | Current GA protocol + version for the GHCP SDK's `InvocationAgentServerHost`. Do NOT add a `responses` protocol entry — see § "Why Invocations Protocol (Not Responses)" |
| `container.resources` nested object | NOT a top-level `resources:` list |
| NO `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` in `environmentVariables` | Reserved — the platform injects it automatically, along with `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ARM_ID`, `FOUNDRY_AGENT_NAME`, `FOUNDRY_AGENT_VERSION`, `FOUNDRY_AGENT_SESSION_ID`, and `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`. Declaring any of them yourself is redundant at best and risks shadowing the platform value |
| `uses: [ai-project]` on the agent service | Forms the dependency graph `azd` resolves at provision/deploy time — the agent can't reference the project's model deployment without it |
| Connect to an existing project via `endpoint:` | Set `services.ai-project.endpoint` from `${FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT}` to reuse a pre-provisioned Foundry project instead of having `azd` provision a new one |
| `infra.provider: microsoft.foundry` | Selects the Foundry extension's bicep-less provisioning provider for the unified services graph |

### Guided init vs. direct-copy brownfield deploy

The **recommended guided path** adopts the manifest and wires the existing
project/registry context into the active azd environment:

```bash
PROJECT_ID="/subscriptions/<sub-id>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<account>/projects/<project>"
azd ai agent init -m ./azure.yaml \
  --project-id "$PROJECT_ID" \
  --deploy-mode container
```

If you instead copy the canonical files into an existing repository and run
`azd deploy` directly (**direct-copy**), `azure.yaml` alone is insufficient.
The `azure.ai.agents` service target requires the full project ARM ID,
project endpoint, subscription, and bare ACR login server in the **active
azd environment**:

```bash
azd env set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID "<sub-id>"
azd env set FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT \
  "https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>"
azd env set AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ID \
  "/subscriptions/<sub-id>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<account>/projects/<project>"
azd env set AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT "<registry>.azurecr.io"
azd env set AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME "<model-deployment>"
azd deploy my-agent --no-prompt
```

`AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT` is a **bare hostname** — no
`https://` scheme and no trailing slash. This direct-copy limitation is
the adoption wiring covered by
[Azure/azure-dev #8981](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/8981):
`azd ai agent init ... --deploy-mode container` wires it automatically;
plain `azd deploy` cannot infer the omitted brownfield values.

### Installing the `azd` Foundry extensions

```bash
azd ext install microsoft.foundry
```

`microsoft.foundry` is a **beta meta-package** — it contributes no
commands of its own. Installing it pulls in every individual Foundry
extension: `azure.ai.agents` (`azd ai agent`, the one this skill uses),
`azure.ai.connections`, `azure.ai.inspector`, `azure.ai.projects`,
`azure.ai.routines`, `azure.ai.skills`, and `azure.ai.toolboxes`. It is
**not** a rename or replacement of `azure.ai.agents` — the agent
extension still owns the `azd ai agent` command group, the
`azure.ai.agent` service `host` value, and the `microsoft.foundry`
**provisioning** identifier azd uses internally when it synthesizes
infrastructure. Installing just `azure.ai.agents` also pulls in
`azure.ai.inspector` (a dependency), so it's a valid narrower
alternative to the meta-package:

```bash
# Just the agent surface (also pulls in azure.ai.inspector)
azd ext install azure.ai.agents

# Upgrade later
azd ext upgrade microsoft.foundry
```

Verify what's installed:

```bash
azd ext list --output json
```

---

## `azd env` variables for the `azure.ai.agents` extension

The guided `azd ai agent init` path is **bicep-less by default** — it
doesn't write an `infra/` directory; `azd` synthesizes infrastructure from
the `services` graph in `azure.yaml`. Guided init writes the brownfield
values below automatically. A direct-copy deploy must set them explicitly
before `azd deploy`:

| Env var | Set via | Format | Why it matters |
|---------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | `azd env set` or guided init | subscription GUID | Selects the subscription containing the existing project and registry |
| `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | `azd env set` or guided init | `https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>` | Deploy-time project lookup for direct-copy brownfield deploy; also injected by Foundry into the running container, but MUST NOT be listed under `environmentVariables` |
| `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ID` | `azd env set` or guided init | `/subscriptions/<sub-id>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<account>/projects/<project>` | Full ARM ID required by the Foundry project resolver; an endpoint alone is insufficient |
| `AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT` | `azd env set` or guided init | `<registry>.azurecr.io` | Bare ACR login server used for container build/push; no scheme or trailing slash |
| `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` | `azd ai agent init` records it automatically from the deployment you select; change later with `azd env set` | deployment name (e.g. `gpt-5.4-mini`) | Projected through the agent service's `environmentVariables` entry in `azure.yaml`, and read by `container.py` as `os.environ["AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"]` |

## Identity & RBAC for hosted agents

`azd ai agent` creates a dedicated Microsoft Entra agent identity per
hosted agent at deploy time (visible via `azd ai agent show`) — this is
what your running container uses to call models and tools.

### Default case: no agent role assignment needed

As of the GA hosted-agent permissions model (Azure/azure-dev PR #8941,
merged 2026-07-03), the Foundry service grants the agent identity its
required permissions **internally** — model inferencing through the
project endpoint and session storage read/write are available by
default, with no client-side role assignment step.

**No explicit role assignment or additional configuration is needed for
the standard BYOK case documented in this skill.** There is no postdeploy
RBAC-grant hook to run, and no manual account-scope `Foundry User` grant
for the agent identity. If you were relying on a manual account-scope
`Foundry User` grant from a pre-GA build of this skill, delete that step —
it's not just unnecessary now, the client-side assignment attempt is
itself what the GA change removed (it used to fail noisily when the
deploying user lacked `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write`).

**A permission error during deploy or invoke is a hard FAIL, except for the
exact immediate-post-active readiness envelope documented under § "Invoking
the Agent".** That narrow case retries the same path with bounded backoff.
Investigate every other cause (wrong scope, expired credential, wrong project)
and do not attempt to work around it with an ad hoc role assignment.

**Deploying user** still needs a role to create/update the agent:

| Role | Scope | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| `Foundry Project Manager` | Foundry project | Data-plane permissions to create/update agents |

`azd` handles the ACR pull role (**Container Registry Repository
Reader** on the project's managed identity) automatically as part of
`azd deploy`.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| **401 on BYOK** | Wrong scope (`cognitiveservices.azure.com`) | Use `https://ai.azure.com/.default` |
| **`send_and_wait()` timeout** | 60s default + 120s gateway limit | Use Invocations protocol instead of ResponsesHostServer |
| **SSE response 0 chars** | Parser only captures `assistant.message` | Also capture `assistant.message_delta` as fallback |
| **Task Adherence eval 0%** | Using `gpt-5.4` as judge model | Use `gpt-5.4-mini` as judge |
| **Agent feels much slower than expected** | CopilotClient internal-turn overhead (20-34 internal calls per query) | Use MAF runtime instead — see `## ⚠️ Performance Caveat: Per-Query Overhead` |
| **CopilotClient needs GITHUB_TOKEN** | Not using BYOK provider | Pass `provider` dict to `create_session()` |
| **`system_message` ignored** | Passed as string | Must be dict: `{"mode": "replace", "content": "..."}` |
| **Skills not loading** | Wrong path format | Use absolute paths in `skill_directories` list |
| **Agent crashes on startup** | Missing `azure-ai-agentserver-invocations` | Add to dependencies, use `prerelease = "if-necessary-or-explicit"` |
| **Gateway timeout (502/504)** | Using Responses protocol for long queries | Switch to Invocations protocol |
| **Token expired during long query** | BYOK token static per session | Token has ~1h validity; for longer sessions, create new session |
| **Token expired during eval runs** | Long eval runs (many scenarios) exhaust the BYOK token | Refresh the provider token per invocation: call `_get_provider()` fresh before each `_ensure_session()`, or create a new session every ~30 min |
| **Container can't resolve packages** | pip doesn't handle pre-release deps | Use `uv` with pre-release settings in `[tool.uv]` |
| **Missing `[tool.setuptools] packages = []`** | uv resolution fails without it | Add to pyproject.toml (see `references/pyproject.toml`) |
| **CognitiveServices API version wrong** | Using old `2024-10-01` | Use `2025-10-01-preview` for agent management APIs |
| **Hooks fail on Windows** | `shell: sh` in a custom azd hook | Use `shell: pwsh` for cross-platform |
| **Permission error on deploy or invoke** | Wrong scope, expired credential, wrong project, or another authorization failure | Hard FAIL except the exact immediate-post-active readiness envelope below. Investigate the real cause and never add a manual role grant |
| **Immediate post-deploy SSE `model.call_failure` 401 / `transient_auth_error`** | Agent version is active but implicit model permission has not finished propagating | Retry the same JSON positional `azd ai agent invoke` path with bounded 15-second backoff (max six); do not grant roles. Any different permission envelope remains a hard FAIL |
| **"responses protocol not declared" (bot 400)** | `azure.yaml`'s agent service only declares `invocations` but bot/CLI calls via Responses API (`oai.responses.create()`) | **Dual protocols don't work** — `InvocationAgentServerHost` only serves `/invocations`; the `/responses` path returns 404 even if a second protocol entry is declared. **Fix:** Rewrite the bot to POST directly to the Invocations SSE endpoint (or use `azd ai agent invoke --protocol invocations`) and parse `assistant.message` + `assistant.message_delta` events. **Alternative:** Use MAF runtime (ResponsesHostServer) which natively serves responses. |
| **ACR push 403 / RBAC error** | Deploying user lacks `AcrPush` on the target ACR | Assign `AcrPush` on the ACR, or use the guided `azd ai agent init --deploy-mode container` path, which wires the registry automatically (Azure/azure-dev #8981) |
| **Evals show no telemetry** | AppInsights not connected to Foundry account | Create `AppInsights` connection on the **account** (not project). Category: `AppInsights`, target: ARM resource ID, metadata: `ApiType: Azure`. `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` is reserved — platform injects it. |
| **Agent traces missing** | Agent identity lacks telemetry RBAC | Assign `Monitoring Metrics Publisher` on AppInsights to the agent identity (from `azd ai agent show`). Project MI needs `Log Analytics Data Reader` on Log Analytics workspace. |
| **gpt-4.1 encrypted content error** | gpt-4.1 deprecated, doesn't support encrypted content required by GHCP SDK | Default to `gpt-5.4-mini` or `gpt-5.4`. Update `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` in `azure.yaml` / azd env. |
| **`azd deploy` says "deployed in <1s" and nothing ships** | Copied a stripped-down `azure.yaml` missing the `services:` block | Use the canonical `references/yaml/azure.yaml` verbatim — see § "azure.yaml (unified GA deployment)" |

## Architecture Comparison

```
MAF (Responses Protocol):
  container.py → Agent + FoundryChatClient + ResponsesHostServer → port 8088
    └── Request/response: caller waits for full response
    └── Timeout: ~120s (Foundry gateway)

GHCP SDK (Invocations Protocol):
  container.py → CopilotClient + InvocationAgentServerHost → port 8088
    └── SSE streaming: events flow continuously
    └── Timeout: unlimited (connection kept alive by events)
```

### Decision Matrix

| Factor | Choose MAF | Choose GHCP SDK |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Tool loop duration | <120s | >120s |
| Custom `@tool` functions | ✅ Required | ❌ Not supported |
| Foundry Toolbox | ✅ `MCPStreamableHTTPTool` (was `get_toolbox()`, removed 1.3.0) | ❌ Not available |
| Streaming output | ❌ Response only | ✅ Event stream |
| Progressive skills | ✅ `SkillsProvider.from_paths()` (or legacy concat) | ✅ `SkillsProvider` |
| MCP tools | `client.get_mcp_tool()` | `mcp_servers` parameter |
| Auth complexity | Low (DAC → FoundryChatClient) | Medium (BYOK token minting) |
| Packages | Stable releases | Pre-release beta |
| Deploy shape | Unified `azure.yaml` (`foundry-hosted-agents`) | Unified `azure.yaml` (this skill) — same GA shape, different protocol/runtime |
