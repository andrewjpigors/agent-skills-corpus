# Product Management Lifecycle: $ARGUMENTS

You are orchestrating the feature **"$ARGUMENTS"** through the complete product management lifecycle. Every phase requires explicit user approval before proceeding to the next.

## Preflight: Observed Patterns Catalog (v7.8.5+ — added 2026-05-13)

<!-- BEGIN pattern-preflight (generated) -->
The [pattern↔skill map](../../shared/pattern-skill-map.json) tracks **67 work-blocking patterns** (25 gate-firing patterns + 42 workflow patterns) drawn from the [Observed Patterns Catalog](../../integrity/observed-patterns.md) (`make observed-patterns`). The patterns below are the ones mapped to `/pm-workflow` work — probe the mechanized ones, checklist the rest:

| ID | Pattern | Blocker | Remediation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `#1` | BRANCH_ISOLATION_HISTORICAL — squash-merge + branch-cleanup artifact *(probed)* | no | Confirm squash-merge cleanup-artifact via PR head_ref; set isolation_opt_out + reason only if work was genuinely direct-to-main. |
| `#2` | CACHE_HITS_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_INACTIVE — Mechanism C captured, writer-path manual *(probed)* | no | Mid-workflow Reads captured but not yet persisted; log via scripts/log-cache-hit.py (v7.9 auto-writes). |
| `#3` | BRANCH_ISOLATION_VIOLATION Mode B — infra-only commit on non-feature branch *(probed)* | yes | Move the infra-path commit onto a feature/chore branch (isolated worktree); Mode B ignores isolation_opt_out. |
| `#4` | BRANCH_ISOLATION_VIOLATION Mode C — state.json current_phase mutation off-branch *(probed)* | yes | Work on the declared feature/chore branch, or set isolation_opt_out + reason when the branch field is legitimately stale. |
| `#5` | ISOLATION_OPT_OUT_REASON_MISSING — opt-out without justification *(probed)* | yes | Set isolation_opt_out_reason to a non-empty justification, or remove isolation_opt_out. |
| `#6` | FEATURE_CLOSURE_COMPLETENESS — missing frontmatter on current_phase=complete *(probed)* | yes | Populate the 7 required case-study frontmatter fields + kill_criteria_resolution before the complete-transition commit. |
| `#7` | CACHE_HITS_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION_DRIFT — empty cache_hits[] post-v6 *(probed)* | yes | Log Reads via scripts/log-cache-hit.py; features created_at < 2026-05-02 are auto-exempt. |
| `#8` | TIER_TAG_LIKELY_INCORRECT — heuristic T1/T2/T3 mismatch (advisory permanent) *(probed)* | no | Verify the T1/T2/T3 tag; pin correct T1 values in case-study-t1-references.json or set tier_tags_present:false. |
| `#9` | SCHEMA_DRIFT_LEGACY_CREATED — legacy `created` key *(probed)* | yes | Rename the legacy `created` key to canonical `created_at` in state.json. |
| `#10` | FRAMEWORK_VERSION_FORMAT — unprefixed numeric values *(probed)* | yes | Set framework_version to canonical vX.Y format (e.g. v7.9). |
| `#11` | STATE_OWNER_* (MISSING / INVALID / LOCATION_MISMATCH) — cross-repo schema *(probed)* | yes | Set state_owner to ft2\|fitme-story matching file location; reverse-sync mirrors use state_owner_sync_origin ending -reverse. |
| `#12` | PR_CACHE_STALE — empty/stale cache → cascading false positives *(probed)* | no | Auto-refreshes via scripts/ensure-pr-cache-fresh.py; run make refresh-pr-cache if findings persist. |
| `#13` | BROKEN_PR_CITATION — unresolved PR cite (graceful fallback when gh unavailable) *(probed)* | yes | Fix the PR citation or add pr_citation_exempt frontmatter; skipped gracefully when gh is unavailable. |
| `#15` | PARTIAL_SHIP_TERMINAL — decision fork on completion *(probed)* | yes | Remove partial_ship:true, or downgrade current_phase + add partial_ship_terminal_disposition. |
| `#16` | CASE_STUDY_MISSING_FIELDS — required frontmatter validation *(probed)* | yes | Fill the required frontmatter fields, or apply the appropriate case_study_type exemption. |
| `#17` | CU_V2_INVALID — schema-only check (presence, not magnitude) *(probed)* | yes | Fix cu_v2 schema: 4 factors in [0,1], total within 0.01 of sum, valid tier_class. |
| `#18` | STATE_NO_CASE_STUDY_LINK — terminal phase requires case_study or exemption *(probed)* | yes | Add case_study / parent_case_study path, or case_study_type:no_case_study_required + reason. |
| `#19` | MECHANISM_C_SHIP_DATE auto-exemption | no | No action — gates auto-exempt features with created_at < 2026-05-02. |
| `#20` | GATE_COVERAGE_ZERO — meta-check for silent-pass detection *(probed)* | no | Diagnose root cause (predicate too strict / schema drift / never-fires-by-design); fix or document advisory-permanent. |
| `#21` | case_study_type exemption tags — bypass scope | no | Apply the correct case_study_type tag + case_study_exempt_reason; framework versions cannot use framework_meta_retroactive post-v7.9. |
| `#24` | Field-rename silent-pass in a READER/INDEX (measurement layer) — generalization of #7/#9 *(probed)* | no | Make the reader accept BOTH field representations (d.get('new') or d.get('legacy')); add a unit test pinning both; grep every reader of a renamed field in the same change. |
| `#25` | Derived index from gitignored session-local source regresses on overwrite — union-merge, don't overwrite *(probed)* | no | A committed artifact derived from a gitignored session-local source must union-merge with the existing committed copy (max counters, min first_seen, max last_*, carry over entries present only in committed), never overwrite. A thin/empty local source must not shrink it. Provide a --rebuild escape hatch for intentional resets. Fixed in scripts/refresh-gate-last-fired.py (PR #749). |
| `W2` | Publish verbatim, then remediate | no | Never silently rewrite published artifacts; add a Correction Note / §99 addendum instead. |
| `W6` | Measurement case-study impartiality | no | Backfill/exempt measurement adoption all-or-none; document any exemption explicitly. |
| `W20` | Stale-session-state inventory drift | no | Run make freshness-check before any 'what's open' inventory or before editing recently-shipped files. |
| `W27` | make preflight enhancement_parent false-positive | no | enhancement_parent mis-aims at the enhancement's own prd.md; verify against state.json::parent_feature (now fixed). |
| `W30` | Q6 PR-list parity gate's minimal YAML parser silently strips list items lacking # | yes | In case-study related_prs frontmatter, use either string form (- "PR #623") OR inline bracket form (related_prs: [621, 623]). Bare YAML integers under dashed lists get silently dropped by _parse_case_study_frontmatter at scripts/check-state-schema.py:1149. Durable parser patch queued in backlog Framework hygiene. |
| `W32` | scripts/close-feature.py requires --force-incomplete when merged PR was the only phase (implementation → complete directly, no testing phase) | yes | For single-phase framework features (e.g., sub-fixes shipping their own unit tests in-phase), call `python3 scripts/close-feature.py <feature> --force-incomplete` directly. The `make close-feature` target does NOT pass --force-incomplete through. Durable script-heuristic patch queued in backlog Framework hygiene. |
| `W35` | Hook session-id keyed on never-set CLAUDE_SESSION_ID env → constant "default" → cross-session marker suppresses the gate forever | yes | When a hook needs the session id, read it from the hook STDIN payload (`session_id`), never `os.environ['CLAUDE_SESSION_ID']` (Claude Code does not set it). Use scripts/w9_session.py::session_id(). Symptoms: a gate's once-per-session marker piles up as `.claude/_session-state/default-*`; a gate's telemetry all carries one outcome from one code path while a documented sibling path emits nothing. When one gate name has two producers, give each its own gate name so GATE_COVERAGE_ZERO can see each independently. Fixed via feature fix/w9-session-id-keying (2026-06-14). |
| `W40` | Cross-layer tracker lag: item shows OPEN in Linear/Notion/backlog while already SHIPPED in the repo (no mechanical slug<->tracker join) *(probed)* | no | Trackers (Linear/Notion/backlog/plans) are downstream mirrors; repo (.claude/features/<slug>/state.json::current_phase + merged PRs) is source of truth. Before starting any tracker item, verify-first against the repo (feature-dir phase + gh pr list/git log); an 'open' item with a complete feature dir or merged PR is stale-open -> close it, don't rebuild. Mechanize via the FW-NAMING convention (FIT-200): slug + state.json.linear_id + scheme-prefixed code; `make crosswalk` builds item-registry.json + advisory for missing joins. Never reuse a bare thematic number across schemes (DE-R14 vs TC-R9). Mark shipped->Done, duplicate->Canceled, permanently-blocked->Won't-Do, keep genuinely-overdue open. See observed-patterns.md W40. |

At activation run `make skill-preflight SKILL=pm-workflow` — probes the 21 mechanized blockers for this work type; clear any before proceeding.

**Mandatory** (CLAUDE.md §v7.8.5): any novel pattern surfaced this session MUST be appended to [`observed-patterns.md`](../../integrity/observed-patterns.md) before the feature closes — then re-run `make gen-skill-preflight`.
<!-- END pattern-preflight -->

## Skill Loading Protocol (v5.1 — On-Demand + Model Tiering)

Before starting any phase, check `.claude/shared/skill-routing.json` → `phase_skills` for the current phase. Load ONLY the listed SKILL.md files — do NOT load all 11 skills.

1. Read `skill-routing.json` → `phase_skills[current_phase]`
   - If the value is an **array**: use it as the skill list directly (v5.0 format, no tier)
   - If the value is an **object**: read `.skills` for the skill list, `.model_tier` for the tier recommendation
2. Load `.claude/skills/{skill}/SKILL.md` for each listed skill
3. For cache: load `compressed_view` fields from `.claude/cache/` by default (≤200 words each)
4. Only expand full cache entries when the compressed view is insufficient — set `expand_cache: true` mentally

**Why:** Loading all 11 SKILL.md files costs ~38K tokens. Most phases need only 1-2 skills. On-demand loading saves ~30K tokens/session. Cache compression saves another ~24K tokens.

**Fallback:** If `phase_skills` is missing or `load_mode` is not `on_demand`, fall back to loading all skills (v4.4 behavior).

## Model Tiering Protocol (v5.1 — ANE Mixed Precision)

After loading phase skills, check `skill-routing.json` → `model_tiering` for the current phase's recommended model tier.

1. Read the `model_tier` field from `phase_skills[current_phase]` (only present if value is an object)
2. If `model_tiering.enabled` is `true` and a tier is found, announce: "Recommended model: **{tier}** ({reason})"
3. **Opus phases** (judgment): research, prd, ux_or_integration, review
4. **Sonnet phases** (mechanical): tasks, implementation, testing, merge, documentation, learn

**User override:** The user can always override the tier recommendation. This is advisory, not enforced.

**Fallback:** If `model_tiering` is missing or `enabled` is `false`, default to opus for all phases.

## Batch Dispatch Protocol (v5.1 — TPU Weight-Stationary)

When the user requests an operation that applies the same skill/command to multiple targets (e.g., "audit all screens", "validate analytics for all features"), use batch dispatch instead of individual invocations.

### Detection

Batch dispatch is appropriate when:
- The user explicitly requests a multi-target operation ("audit screens X, Y, Z")
- Phase 0 of a parent feature spawns multiple child audits
- Analytics taxonomy sync needs to run across multiple features

### Execution

1. Check `skill-routing.json` → `batch_dispatch.supported_operations` for a matching operation
2. If found:
   a. **Load template once** — read the `template_source` file into context
   b. **Iterate targets** — for each target, apply the template and collect results
   c. **Aggregate** — produce a single report with per-target sections
   d. **Write individual** — if `output_pattern` is set, write per-target files
3. If not found in `supported_operations`, fall back to sequential individual dispatches

### Supported Batch Operations

| Operation | Skill | Template | Targets |
|-----------|-------|----------|---------|
| `audit` | /ux | ux-foundations.md | Screen files (Swift) |
| `design_compliance` | /design | design-system.json | UX spec files |
| `analytics_taxonomy_sync` | /analytics | analytics-taxonomy.csv | Feature PRD files |

### Example: Batch Audit

User: "Audit all 6 screens for v2 alignment"

1. Load `docs/design-system/ux-foundations.md` (template — load ONCE)
2. For each screen in [Home, Training, Nutrition, Stats, Settings, Onboarding]:
   a. Read the current v1 Swift file
   b. Apply UX foundations audit pattern
   c. Collect findings (P0/P1/P2 with tractability tags)
3. Produce aggregated report: `v2-batch-audit-report.md`
4. Write individual: `.claude/features/{screen}/v2-audit-report.md` per screen

**Savings:** 1 template load + N screen reads = N+1 reads. Without batch: N × (template + screen) = 2N reads. For N=6: 7 vs 12 reads + 5 fewer hub dispatch cycles.

**Fallback:** If `batch_dispatch` config is missing from `skill-routing.json`, each target is dispatched individually (v5.0 behavior).

## Dispatch Intelligence Protocol (v5.2 — Pre-Flight + Routing)

Before dispatching any subagent, apply the 3-stage pipeline from `.claude/shared/dispatch-intelligence.json`:

### Stage 1 — Score Complexity

Read the task's `complexity` field from tasks.md (lightweight/standard/heavyweight). If missing, default to `standard`.

### Stage 2 — Probe Capability

Check target file paths against the `permission_table` in dispatch-intelligence.json:
- Path matches `known_writable` → dispatch to subagent
- Path matches `known_readonly` → controller handles directly
- Unknown path → dispatch haiku micro-probe (5 tool budget, 15s timeout)

**Critical note:** `.claude/` paths are in `known_writable` in the table but subagents CANNOT write to them regardless of settings.json permissions. The controller must always handle `.claude/` writes directly.

### Stage 3 — Dispatch with Budget

Use `model_routing` config for the task's complexity tier:
- Include in prompt: `"BUDGET: You have {N} tool uses for this task."`
- Set model parameter: haiku (lightweight), sonnet (standard), opus (heavyweight)
- On budget hit: accept if usable, escalate if incomplete (max 1 escalation)

### Escalation Path

`lightweight (haiku) → standard (sonnet) → heavyweight (opus) → BLOCKED (report to user)`

### Dispatch Logging

Every dispatch logs to the checkpoint file for validation analysis:
```json
{"task_id": "T1", "predicted_complexity": "standard", "model_used": "sonnet", "tool_budget": 25, "actual_tool_uses": 15, "actual_duration_seconds": 102, "result": "DONE", "quality": "no_rework"}
```

### Mirror Pattern (v5.2B — Parallel Write Safety)

When dispatching an agent to modify a SHARED file (one that other agents may also modify):

**Pre-dispatch:**
1. **SNAPSHOT** the target file to `.build/snapshots/{dispatch_id}/`
2. **EXTRACT** the agent's region using 3-tier detection:
   - Tier 1: `// BEGIN:agent-region:{name}` markers → extract between BEGIN/END (fastest)
   - Tier 2: `// MARK: - {Section}` conventions → extract from MARK to next MARK (fast)
   - Tier 3: Full file → give entire file, flag for marker addition (slow, first-time penalty)
3. **DISPATCH** with region only + read-only type context (imports, signatures)

**Agent prompt includes:**
```
You are modifying this code region:
---
[extracted region]
---
Add your code within this region. Return ONLY the modified region content.
```

**Post-return:**
4. **RECONSTRUCT** the file by replacing the region at its boundaries
5. **BUILD CHECK** — run xcodebuild
6. If **PASS**: delete snapshot, add markers if Tier 3 was used, commit
7. If **FAIL**: **ROLLBACK** from snapshot, log error, redispatch or escalate

**Progressive learning:** Each Tier 3 dispatch that succeeds adds `// BEGIN:agent-region:{name}` / `// END:agent-region:{name}` markers. Next dispatch to the same region uses Tier 1 automatically. The system gets faster with every dispatch.

**When NOT to use mirror pattern:**
- project.pbxproj edits (use ID-prefix isolation instead — proven in stress test)
- Files only one agent will touch (no contention risk)
- Files under 50 lines (overhead exceeds benefit)

## Phase Timing Protocol (v6.0 — Measurement Instrumentation)

Every phase transition now records precise timestamps in `state.json → timing`. This replaces estimated wall times with measured durations.

### On Phase Start (after user approves transition)

1. Write `timing.phases[{phase}].started_at` = current ISO 8601 timestamp
2. If this is the **first phase** of the feature, also write `timing.session_start` = now
3. If resuming after a break, ask the user: "How long were you away?" and add the answer to the previous phase's `paused_minutes`

### On Phase End (before requesting next transition approval)

1. Write `timing.phases[{phase}].ended_at` = current ISO 8601 timestamp
2. Compute `timing.phases[{phase}].duration_minutes` = `(ended_at - started_at)` in minutes
3. Update `state.json → updated` timestamp

### On Feature Completion (current_phase → "complete")

1. Write `timing.session_end` = current ISO 8601 timestamp
2. Compute `timing.total_wall_time_minutes` = sum of all `timing.phases[*].duration_minutes`
3. Set `timing.time_source` = `"measured"`

### Multi-Session Features

If a feature spans multiple conversations/sessions:
1. On session start: append a new entry to `timing.sessions[]` with `started_at` = now and `phases_active` = [current phase]
2. On session end: write `ended_at` and compute `duration_minutes` for the current session entry
3. `timing.total_wall_time_minutes` = sum of all `timing.sessions[*].duration_minutes`

### Parallel Features

When multiple features are being worked on concurrently (stress tests, parallel dispatch):
1. Set `timing.parallel_context.concurrent_features` = count of active features
2. Set `timing.parallel_context.concurrent_feature_slugs` = list of other feature slugs
3. Set `timing.parallel_context.is_stress_test` = true if this is a deliberate parallel test

## Cache Tracking Protocol (v6.0 — Deterministic Hit Logging)

Replace probabilistic cache health checks with deterministic per-event logging. Every cache access is recorded in `.claude/features/{feature}/cache-hits.json`.

### On Skill Load (reading from .claude/cache/{skill}/)

1. Check if a cache entry exists for the current task type and context
2. **HIT**: Append to `cache-hits.json → sessions[current].hits[]`:
   ```json
   {
     "timestamp": "{ISO 8601}",
     "cache_level": "L1|L2|L3",
     "skill": "{skill-name}",
     "cache_key": "{skill}:{task_type}:{context}",
     "hit_type": "exact|adapted",
     "task_context": "{task description from tasks list}"
   }
   ```
3. **MISS**: Append to `cache-hits.json → sessions[current].misses[]`:
   ```json
   {
     "timestamp": "{ISO 8601}",
     "cache_level": "L1|L2|L3",
     "skill": "{skill-name}",
     "expected_key": "{key that was looked up}",
     "miss_reason": "no_entry|stale|wrong_context",
     "task_context": "{task description}"
   }
   ```
4. **STALE** (SHA256 of source file doesn't match `invalidated_by` hash): Log as miss with `miss_reason: "stale"`

### Hit Type Taxonomy

- `exact`: Cache entry used directly without modification
- `adapted`: Cache entry used as a starting point but modified for current context
- `stale`: Entry existed but was outdated — counted as a miss

### On Phase Completion

1. Compute session summary: count L1/L2/L3 hits and misses
2. Write `total_hit_rate = total_hits / (total_hits + total_misses)` to session summary

### On Feature Completion

1. Finalize `aggregate` section in `cache-hits.json` (totals across all sessions)
2. Identify `most_valuable_hit` (entry that saved the most rework) and `costliest_miss` (pattern that had to be built from scratch)
3. Update `.claude/shared/cache-metrics.json`:
   - Increment `by_framework_version[current].features_measured`
   - Recompute `avg_hit_rate` and `L1_avg/L2_avg/L3_avg`
   - Add to `cache_health_trend[]` with date and hit rate
4. Check promotion candidates: any L1 entry hit by 2+ different skills → add to `promotion_candidates[]`

### Velocity Annotation

When writing the case study, annotate velocity claims based on cache hit rate:
- `hit_rate >= 0.6`: velocity is framework-attributable (no annotation needed)
- `hit_rate 0.3–0.6`: annotate as "partial cache" — velocity partially reflects practitioner skill
- `hit_rate < 0.3`: annotate as "cold cache" — velocity may significantly reflect practitioner skill over framework

This annotation does NOT change the CU calculation. It adds interpretive context to min/CU comparisons.

## Contemporaneous Logging Protocol (v7.5 — Tier 2.2 Auto-Emission)

**This protocol supersedes the v6.0 Cache Tracking Protocol's separate
`.claude/features/{feature}/cache-hits.json` writer path.** The canonical
Tier 2.2 writer is `scripts/append-feature-log.py`, which writes to
`.claude/logs/{feature}.log.json` AND mirrors cache events into
`state.json.cache_hits[]` so `make measurement-adoption` counts them.
Filed as issue #140; shipped 2026-04-24. If the v6.0 instructions above
conflict with this section, this section wins.

### On every phase transition (auto-emit, not voluntary)

When the user approves a phase transition (Research → PRD, PRD → Tasks, etc.),
the skill MUST append an event to the feature's log before any other write:

```bash
python3 scripts/append-feature-log.py \
  --feature {feature-slug} \
  --event-type phase_started \
  --phase {new-phase} \
  --summary "Phase {new-phase} opened after user approval of the {old-phase} exit criteria." \
  --actor claude_opus_4_7
```

Then, on phase end (before requesting the next transition):

```bash
python3 scripts/append-feature-log.py \
  --feature {feature-slug} \
  --event-type phase_approved \
  --phase {phase} \
  --summary "Phase {phase} complete. {1-sentence of what landed.}" \
  --artifact {list of files touched} \
  --metric tests_passing=N \
  --actor claude_opus_4_7
```

### On any cache hit during work (Tier 1.1 writer path)

When the skill loads a cache entry (L1 per-skill, L2 shared, or L3 project)
and the entry materially influenced the output, emit a cache-hit event using
the v7.7 auto-discovering wrapper (added T2 / commit `448d989` branch):

```bash
python3 scripts/log-cache-hit.py \
  --key <cache-key> \
  --layer <L1|L2|L3> \
  [--hit-type <adapted|exact|miss>] \
  [--skill <skill-name>]
```

The wrapper auto-discovers the active feature by scanning
`.claude/features/*/state.json` by mtime (most-recently-modified non-paused
feature wins), so `--feature` is not required. It dual-writes: first to
`state.json.cache_hits[]` directly, then delegates to
`scripts/append-feature-log.py` for Tier 2.2 narrative logging. It is
fail-soft — any error exits 0 with a warning to stderr so logging never
breaks cache reads. The v7.7 T3 hook (`CACHE_HITS_EMPTY_POST_V6`, commit
`448d989`) gates `current_phase: complete` on at least one `cache_hits[]`
entry, so this call is now required before a feature can be marked complete.

If you need to supply the feature name explicitly (e.g. the active-feature
auto-discovery would resolve to the wrong feature), fall back to the direct
invocation:

```bash
python3 scripts/append-feature-log.py \
  --feature {feature-slug} \
  --event-type cache_hit \
  --phase {current-phase} \
  --summary "Reused {cache-key} for {task description}. {What it saved.}" \
  --cache-hit L1|L2|L3 \
  --cache-key {entry-id} \
  --cache-hit-type exact|adapted \
  --cache-skill {skill-name}
```

Both calls append to the log AND to `state.json.cache_hits[]`. Prefer the
wrapper for the normal case (no `--feature` arg needed = less friction =
higher adoption).

### On runtime verification events (Tier 2.1)

When `make runtime-smoke PROFILE=<id> MODE=<local|staging>` produces a
`passed` or `failed` status, emit a `runtime_verification` event:

```bash
python3 scripts/append-feature-log.py \
  --feature {feature-slug} \
  --event-type runtime_verification \
  --phase test \
  --summary "Staging {profile} smoke {passed|failed}. {xcresult bundle link.}" \
  --artifact .claude/shared/runtime-smoke-staging-{profile}.json \
  --metric status={passed|failed} \
  --metric returncode={0|N}
```

### Why auto-emit?

v7.5 Tier 2.2 shipped as "pilot active" specifically because adoption
was voluntary — contributors had to remember to invoke the logger. This
protocol makes emission automatic on the PM workflow's own transition
events, eliminating the adoption gap.

The retroactive policy still applies: if the skill needs to append an
event older than the most recent entry, it must use `--retroactive
--retroactive-reason "..."`. The logger enforces this.

### What this does NOT do

- It does not auto-generate the narrative case study. That's still a
  Phase 9 deliverable written after merge.
- It does not replace `state.json → timing` instrumentation. Both
  coexist: `timing` is the measured-duration ledger; `.claude/logs/`
  is the narrative event trail.
- It does not backfill the v6.0-era `.claude/features/{feature}/cache-hits.json`
  files — those are frozen as-is. Going forward, the log + state.json
  path is canonical.

## Eval Coverage Gate Protocol (v6.0 — AI Quality Assurance)

Ensures AI-touching features have verifiable eval coverage before shipping. Non-AI features auto-pass.

### During PRD Phase (AI-touching features only)

1. Identify all **AI behaviors** in the PRD:
   - Recommendations (nutrition, training, recovery)
   - Scoring (readiness, confidence, tier assignment)
   - Classification (cohort, goal-awareness, intensity selection)
   - Any output that depends on AI/ML logic
2. For each behavior, define minimum eval coverage:
   - **Golden I/O evals**: >= 3 per behavior (known-good input → expected output)
   - **Quality heuristic evals**: >= 2 per behavior (output meets quality bar)
   - **Tier/edge case evals**: >= 1 per behavior (boundary conditions)
3. Write the coverage plan to the PRD under `### Test & Eval Requirements`
4. Store the full behavior list in `state.json → phases.testing.eval_results.uncovered_behaviors`

### During Testing Phase

1. Run evals: `cd ai-engine && pytest evals/ -v`
2. Parse results and write to `state.json → phases.testing.eval_results`:
   - `total_evals`, `passing`, `failing`, `eval_pass_rate`
   - `categories` breakdown (golden_io, quality_heuristic, tier_behavior, etc.)
   - Update `uncovered_behaviors` — remove behaviors that now have evals
3. **Gate check**: `min_eval_coverage_met` = every behavior in the original list has >= 1 passing eval
4. If **gate fails**: BLOCK transition to Review phase
   - Display: "Eval gate failed: {N} behaviors still uncovered: {list}"
   - User can override with justification → record in `transitions[].note`: "Eval gate overridden: {reason}"
5. If **gate passes**: Set `min_eval_coverage_met = true`, proceed normally

### Non-AI Features

- `eval_results` stays at defaults (total_evals: 0, passing: 0)
- `min_eval_coverage_met` auto-set to `true`
- Gate does not block

### How to Detect AI-Touching Features

A feature touches AI if ANY of these are true:
- PRD references AIOrchestrator, ReadinessEngine, NutritionRecommender, TrainingRecommender, or CohortIntelligence
- `state.json → has_ui` is true AND the feature modifies views that display AI-generated content
- The task list includes changes to `ai-engine/` directory
- The PRD has a "### AI Behaviors" or "### Recommendation Logic" section

## Monitoring Sync Protocol (v6.0 — Auto-Update Case Study Monitoring)

Phase transitions automatically update `case-study-monitoring.json`. This replaces manual monitoring updates with structured, event-driven writes.

### Phase Transition Triggers

| Transition | Fields Updated in case-study-monitoring.json |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| research → prd | `process_metrics.research_complete = true` |
| prd → tasks | `process_metrics.prd_approved = true` |
| tasks → implement | `process_metrics.tasks_defined = state.phases.tasks.count` |
| implement → testing | `process_metrics.repo_files_added` and `repo_files_updated` from `git diff --stat` |
| testing → review | `process_metrics.tests_passing`, `build_verified`, `ai_quality_metrics.eval_pass_rate`, `eval_total`, `eval_failed[]` |
| review → merge | `quality_metrics.critical_findings`, `high_findings`, `medium_findings` from review |
| merge → docs | `process_metrics.merged = true`, `pr_number` from state.json |
| docs → complete | Add snapshot with label `"feature-complete-auto-{ISO 8601}"`, write `timing.total_wall_time_minutes` |

### Snapshot Protocol

Every auto-sync also adds a snapshot entry:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "{ISO 8601}",
  "label": "auto-sync-{from_phase}-to-{to_phase}",
  "metrics": { "/* current metrics at time of transition */" }
}
```

### Fallback

If `case-study-monitoring.json` does not have an entry for the current feature:
1. Create one with the feature slug as `case_id`
2. Set `status: "in_progress"`, `framework_version`, `work_type` from state.json
3. Then proceed with the sync

### Manual Override

The auto-sync writes structured fields only. Narrative notes, decisions, and custom metrics are still added manually. Auto-synced snapshots are labeled with `auto-sync-` prefix to distinguish them from manually written ones.

## Result Forwarding Protocol (v5.1 — UMA Zero-Copy)

When skills execute in a known chain (e.g., Phase 3 dispatch chain), pass the output of each skill inline to the next skill instead of writing to disk and re-reading.

### When to Forward

Check `skill-routing.json` → `result_forwarding.eligible_chains` for the current skill transition. If a matching chain exists and `result_forwarding.enabled` is `true`:

1. Execute the source skill and capture its full output
2. **Write to disk** (always — for audit trail and fallback)
3. **Forward inline** — pass the output directly to the next skill in context
4. **Tag the forwarded content** with `_forwarded_from: "{skill}:{command}"` so the receiving skill knows it does not need to read from disk

### Receiving Skill Behavior

When a skill detects `_forwarded_from` in its context:
1. **Skip disk read** of the forwarded artifact
2. Use the in-context content directly
3. Log: "Using forwarded content from {source} — skipped disk read of {path}"

### Phase 3 Dispatch Chain (Optimized)

| Step | Dispatch | Output | Forwarded to |
|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| 3a | `/ux audit {feature}` | v2-audit-report | Step 3b (inline) |
| 3b | `/ux research {feature}` | ux-research | Step 3c (inline) |
| 3c | `/ux spec {feature}` | ux-spec | Steps 3d, 3e, 3f (inline) |
| 3d | `/ux validate {feature}` | validation report | Step 3e (inline) |
| 3e | `/design audit` | compliance report | Steps 3f, 3g (inline) |
| 3f | `/ux prompt {feature}` | ux-build.md | disk only |
| 3g | `/design prompt {feature}` | design-build.md | disk only |

Each step writes to disk AND forwards inline. The receiving step skips its disk read.

**Fallback:** If `result_forwarding` config is missing or `_forwarded_from` is absent, the receiving skill reads from disk (v5.0 behavior).

## Speculative Cache Pre-loading (v5.1 — Branch Prediction)

When a skill starts execution, speculatively pre-load the compressed cache views for the skill that is most likely to run next.

### Protocol

1. On skill start, read `skill-routing.json` → `speculative_preload.successor_map[current_skill]`
2. If found and `speculative_preload.enabled` is `true`:
   a. Read `likely_next` and `confidence` from the successor entry
   b. If confidence >= 0.85: pre-load each cache entry in `preload[]` using `compressed_view` only
   c. Tag pre-loaded entries as `_speculative: true`
3. When the next skill actually starts:
   a. If it matches `likely_next`: the speculative entries become the warm cache (Phase 1 cache check is instant)
   b. If it does NOT match: discard speculative entries (cost: ~3K tokens, 1.5% of budget)

### Misprediction Handling

- Misprediction cost is bounded at `misprediction_budget_tokens` (3,000 tokens)
- Only `compressed_view` fields are pre-loaded (never full cache entries)
- Prediction accuracy is tracked in `change-log.json` as `speculative_prediction` events
- If hit rate drops below `hit_rate_target` (0.85), the hub logs a warning and the user can disable speculative preloading

### Successor Map Key Format

Keys use `skill:command` format for sub-command-level prediction, or just `skill` for skill-level prediction:
- `ux:spec` → predicts `design:audit` (Phase 3 chain)
- `dev` → predicts `qa` (implementation → testing)

**Fallback:** If `speculative_preload` config is missing, no pre-loading occurs (v5.0 behavior).

## Systolic Chain Protocol (v5.1 — TPU Systolic Array)

For defined multi-skill chains, execute in pipeline mode: each skill receives ONLY upstream output + its own L1 cache. No global shared-layer reads mid-execution.

### When to Use

Check `skill-routing.json` → `systolic_chains.defined_chains` for a matching chain based on the current phase and work type:
- `v2_refactor_pipeline`: Phase 3 for v2 refactor work subtypes
- `new_feature_ux_pipeline`: Phase 3 for new UI features
- `implementation_pipeline`: Phase 4 → Phase 5

### Full Isolation Mode

For chains with `isolation_level: "full"` (UX/design pipelines):

1. **Chain start:** Hub identifies the matching chain and loads the first stage's inputs
2. **Per stage:**
   a. Skill receives ONLY items listed in its `receives[]` (from upstream output or initial inputs)
   b. Skill has access to its own L1 cache (`compressed_view` only)
   c. Skill does NOT read from shared layer (`.claude/shared/*.json`)
   d. Skill produces its `produces` artifact
   e. Output is forwarded inline to the next stage (per Result Forwarding protocol)
3. **Chain end:** After ALL stages complete:
   a. All artifacts are batch-written to disk
   b. Shared layer is updated with all accumulated state changes
   c. `state.json` transitions are recorded

### Partial Isolation Mode

For chains with `isolation_level: "partial"` (implementation pipeline):

1. Each stage receives upstream output + L1 cache (same as full)
2. Each stage MAY read from shared layer when `reads_global: true` is set for that stage
3. Write-back happens after each stage (not batched)

### Isolation Guarantee

The key invariant: in full isolation, the shared layer is NEVER read between chain start and chain end. This means:
- No Amdahl's Law bottleneck on the shared-layer read path
- Each stage's context window contains only what it needs
- The shared layer is a write-back target, like a register file in hardware

**Fallback:** If no matching chain exists in `systolic_chains.defined_chains`, use standard per-skill execution with shared-layer reads (v5.0 behavior).

## Alternative invocation: `/pm-workflow roadmap <verb>`

When `$ARGUMENTS` is the literal token `roadmap` (optionally followed by a verb), do NOT run the standard feature lifecycle. Instead load the roadmap reference and dispatch to the requested verb:

| Invocation | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/pm-workflow roadmap` (no verb) | Print verb menu + brief usage |
| `/pm-workflow roadmap review` | Read current roadmap + state.json drift report |
| `/pm-workflow roadmap prioritize` | Re-rank backlog via RICE / MoSCoW / Now-Next-Later |
| `/pm-workflow roadmap decide {item}` | Produce a decision memo for one backlog item |

**Dispatch:** load [`.claude/skills/pm-workflow/references/roadmap.md`](references/roadmap.md) (Anthropic progressive-disclosure pattern). Follow the sub-command protocol section that matches the verb. Do not load any phase-lifecycle protocols (Setup, State Initialization, Work Item Type Selection, Phase 0–9) when in `roadmap` mode — those are for feature work.

Outputs go to:
- Decision memos: `docs/master-plan/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`
- Reordering diffs: stdout (user applies manually)
- State drift report: stdout

Closes §3A Gap #2 from `docs/skills/skills-review-2026-05-13.md`.

---

## Setup

1. Check if `.claude/features/$0/state.json` exists
   - If yes: resume from `current_phase`
   - If no: create the directory and initialize state.json from the schema below

2. **Write the active-feature lockfile** (v7.8 Mechanism C wiring): write `$0` to `.claude/active-feature`. The PostToolUse:Read hook (`scripts/observe-cache-hit.py`) reads this file to attribute auto-collected cache events to the correct feature in `.claude/logs/_session-<id>.events.jsonl`. Without it, session events accumulate with empty `active_feature` strings and the v7.9 attribution-based gates won't see them.
   ```bash
   echo "$0" > .claude/active-feature
   ```

3. Read the current state and announce: "Feature **$0** — currently in Phase {N}: {name}. Here's what needs to happen next."

4. **GitHub Issue sync check:**
   - If `github_issue_number` is set in state.json: verify the issue exists and check its `phase:*` label
   - If no `github_issue_number`: search GitHub Issues for this feature by title. If found, store the number. If not found, offer to create one.
   - If state.json `current_phase` doesn't match the GitHub Issue's `phase:*` label: ask the user which source is correct and reconcile (see Conflict Resolution in Dashboard Sync Automation)

5. If the user says "Move to {phase}" or "Roll back to {phase}": execute the Manual Override procedure (see Dashboard Sync Automation) instead of the normal phase workflow.

## State Initialization

Create `.claude/features/$0/state.json`:
```json
{
  "feature": "$0",
  "created": "{current ISO-8601 timestamp}",
  "updated": "{current ISO-8601 timestamp}",
  "branch": "feature/$0",
  "current_phase": "research",
  "work_type": "feature",
  "has_ui": null,
  "requires_analytics": null,
  "phases": {
    "research": { "status": "in_progress", "approved_at": null, "sources": [] },
    "prd": { "status": "pending", "approved_at": null, "analytics_spec_complete": false },
    "tasks": { "status": "pending", "count": 0 },
    "ux_or_integration": { "status": "pending", "type": null, "preflight_passed": null },
    "implementation": { "status": "pending", "commits": [] },
    "testing": { "status": "pending", "ci_passed": false, "tests_added": 0, "instrumentation_verified": false, "analytics_tests_added": 0, "analytics_verification_passed": false },
    "review": { "status": "pending", "risks": [], "ci_main": false, "ci_feature": false },
    "merge": { "status": "pending", "pr_number": null, "analytics_regression_passed": null },
    "documentation": { "status": "pending" },
    "metrics": {
      "primary": { "name": "", "baseline": null, "target": null, "current": null },
      "secondary": [],
      "guardrails": [],
      "instrumentation_ready": false,
      "first_review_date": null,
      "kill_criteria": ""
    }
  },
  "tasks": [],
  "figma_node_ids": {},
  "figma_build_status": null,
  "pre_merge_review": { "ux": null, "design": null }
}
```

**Field reference (v4.X additions, 2026-05-06):**

- `phases.ux_or_integration.preflight_passed` — set by `/ux preflight` + `/design preflight` aggregate result. `true` when both gates pass; `false` if any P0 unresolved.
- `figma_node_ids` — populated by `/design build`. Keys are screen names from `ux-spec.md`, values are Figma node IDs (e.g. `{"imported_plans_list": "1234:567"}`). Read by `/design pre-merge-review`.
- `figma_build_status` — `"completed"` (MCP build succeeded), `"deferred_to_prompt"` (MCP unreachable, prompt saved for manual handoff), or `null` (not yet attempted).
- `pre_merge_review.ux` — `"passed" | "passed_with_notes" | "blocked" | null`. Set by `/ux pre-merge-review`. Phase 7 gate.
- `pre_merge_review.design` — `"passed" | "passed_with_notes" | "blocked" | null`. Set by `/design pre-merge-review`. Phase 7 gate.

## Work Item Type Selection

Before starting Phase 0, determine the work item type:

Ask: **"Is this a Feature, Enhancement, Fix, or Chore?"**

| Type | Phases | When to Use |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Feature** | Full 10-phase lifecycle (0-9) | New capabilities, new screens, new services |
| **Enhancement** | Tasks → Implement → Test → Merge (4 phases) | Improvements to shipped features with existing PRDs |
| **Fix** | Implement → Test (2 phases) | Bug fixes, error handling, security patches |
| **Chore** | Implement only (1 phase) | Docs, config, refactoring, dependency updates |

Set `work_type` in state.json. For non-Feature types:
- **Enhancement:** Skip Research, PRD, UX. Start at Phase 2 (Tasks). Set `parent_feature` to the existing feature being enhanced.
- **Fix:** Skip to Phase 4 (Implement). Auto-set first task with `skill: "dev"`. **Test + Review are still required** (Phase 5 + 6).
- **Chore:** Skip to Phase 4 (Implement). Test gate is optional, but **review gate is still required** for any code change.

All skipped phases get `status: "skipped"` with `reason: "work_type:{type}"` in the audit trail.

### Review Gates (Non-Negotiable)

**Every work item type that changes code MUST pass through Test + Review before merge.** The fast-track reduces _planning_ overhead, not _quality_ gates:

| Type | Planning | Test | Review | Merge | Feedback |
|------|----------|------|--------|-------|----------|
| Feature | Full | Required | Required | Required | Full loop |
| Enhancement | Partial | Required | Required | Required | Full loop |
| Fix | None | Required | Required | Required | Full loop |
| Chore (docs only) | None | Optional | Required | Required | Notify only |

### Change Broadcast (Awareness Protocol)

When ANY work item completes (merge to main), broadcast a change notification to ALL skills so the entire system stays aware:

1. **Update `.claude/shared/feature-registry.json`** — record what changed, when, and why
2. **Notify downstream skills:**
   - `/qa` — "New code merged. Run regression check on next cycle."
   - `/cx` — "Change shipped: {description}. Monitor user feedback for impact."
   - `/analytics` — "Verify instrumentation still intact after merge."
   - `/ops` — "Deployment pending. Check health after deploy."
   - `/design` — "If UI changed, verify design system compliance."
   - **Notion** — Update the feature's Notion page to `phase:done` via `notion-update-page`.
3. **Write a change event to `.claude/shared/change-log.json`:**
   ```json
   {
     "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
     "feature": "feature-name",
     "work_type": "fix",
     "description": "Eliminated force unwraps in production code",
     "files_changed": 4,
     "skills_notified": ["qa", "cx", "ops"],
     "review_status": "approved",
     "test_status": "passed"
   }
   ```

### Upstream Feedback Loop

When `/cx analyze` or `/qa regression` detects an issue post-merge:

1. **Classify the signal:**
   - Customer confusion → `/marketing` (messaging) + `/design` (UX)
   - Regression → `/dev` (fix) + `/qa` (test gap)
   - Performance degradation → `/ops` (infra) + `/dev` (optimization)
   - Expectation mismatch → `/pm-workflow` (re-scope)

2. **Create a new work item** (typically Fix or Enhancement) that links back to the original change
3. **The new work item inherits context** from the original — no information is lost
4. **Close the loop:** When the fix ships, `/cx` re-monitors to verify the issue is resolved

---

## Phase 0: Research & Discovery

**Goal:** Understand what we're building, why, and validate the approach before committing to a PRD.

### Phase 0.0 — Unified preflight (v7.8.6+, MANDATORY first step)

Before any phase-specific work, run:

```bash
make preflight WORK_TYPE=<feature|enhancement|fix|chore> [FEATURE=<name>]
```

This writes `.claude/shared/preflight-cache.json` with the data downstream skills depend on:

- **W1 ssh-agent state** — prevents silent commit-signing hang
- **PR citation cache freshness** — prevents v7.8.4 PR_CACHE_STALE false-positives
- **Current branch + isolation status** — flags infra-path commits from main
- **Current integrity findings + advisory count** — system-wide health
- **Integrity diff vs 2026-05-14 anchor** — drift detection (closes 96h cron gap per data-integrity §2.1)
- **Documentation-debt + measurement-adoption baselines** — calibration data for post-ship comparison
- **Work-type-specific check** — feature state.json, enhancement parent, fix high-risk-touch, chore infra-path

Downstream skills (`/ux`, `/design`, `/dev`, `/qa`, `/analytics`, `/cx`, `/ops`, `/release`, `/marketing`, `/research`) read this cache instead of re-collecting the data. The cache is overwritten each run; re-run when work_type or feature changes.

Block phase advancement if the preflight reports `blocking > 0`.

**Cross-layer freshness (auto-chained, 2026-05-28+).** `make preflight` also runs `make freshness-check` which surfaces:

- **Recent merged PRs (both repos, last 7d)** — catches the W20 failure mode where session-state thinks work is open but the operator already shipped it (root-cause of the 2026-05-28 prereg-duplication incident).
- **Stale worktrees (behind > 7 commits vs origin/main)** — flags worktrees that would silently overwrite shipped work on commit.
- **Memory ↔ feature-state drift** — surfaces `MEMORY.md` entries claiming "in flight" / "paused" / "pending" for features whose `state.json::current_phase` is now `complete`.
- **Linear sync (optional)** — FIT-team root-issue status when `LINEAR_API_KEY` is set.

Cross-reference the freshness output against any operator-gate inventory, status survey, or files you're about to edit. See [W20](.claude/integrity/observed-patterns.md#w20--stale-session-state-inventory-drift-2026-05-28) + [`feedback_cross_layer_freshness_check.md`](../../memory/feedback_cross_layer_freshness_check.md).

### Phase 0.1 — Per-feature reality-check (v7.9.1+ F2, MANDATORY for Enhancement / Fix / Chore)

After Phase 0.0 preflight, run the per-feature reality-check:

```bash
make phase-0-reality-check FEATURE=<feature-name>
# or equivalently:
python3 scripts/phase-0-reality-check.py --feature <feature-name>
```

This reads the feature's `state.json::tasks` list and cross-checks each `pending` / `in_progress` / `open` task against the last 30 days of:

- **Git log subjects** — has anyone shipped a commit whose subject contains the task's keywords?
- **Merged PR titles** (FT2 + fitme-story) — has either repo merged a PR matching the task?
- **Tier 2.2 log events** in `.claude/logs/<feature>.log.json` — has anyone logged an `implementation` or `phase_transition` event mentioning the task ID or keywords?

Output: stdout summary + structured JSON at `.claude/shared/phase-0-reality-check.json`. Advisories surface as "**this task may already be done**" — never blocking, always operator-judgment.

**Why this matters.** I (the agent + operator) repeatedly hit the post-squash-merge state-drift pattern in 2026-06-01 → 2026-06-04: 5 confirmed instances where state.json::tasks said `pending` but the file changes were already on `main` via a prior PR. Phase 0.1 surfaces this BEFORE the new work gets scheduled, so the task list gets reconciled first (likely via `make close-feature FEATURE=<name>`) and the new Phase 0 starts against accurate state.

**When this is mandatory:** for any `Enhancement`, `Fix`, or `Chore` where the parent feature exists. **Optional but recommended:** new `Feature` work where the topic intersects with recent shipped work — false positives are fine since they cost nothing to dismiss.

**Block phase advancement** if Phase 0.1 flags ≥1 advisory AND the operator has not explicitly acknowledged the finding (via `state.json::phase_0_reality_check_acknowledged: ["T3 reviewed — not the same scope"]` or by flipping the affected task's status).

Spec: [`docs/master-plan/infra-master-plan-2026-05-12.md`](../../../docs/master-plan/infra-master-plan-2026-05-12.md) §3.1 Theme A F2 (RICE 42.7).

### Phase 0 variant by work subtype

| Subtype | Phase 0 primary output | Skills dispatched |
|---|---|---|
| **New feature** | `research.md` (market + competitive + alternatives) + populated `state.json::brainstorm` block | `/brainstorm-pm` (default — problem/solution/assumption/strategy modes + three-option trade-off mode for scoped problems with multiple viable paths, added 2026-06-03) → `/research wide` → `/research narrow` → `/research feature` |
| **V2 refactor** (`state.json.work_subtype == "v2_refactor"`) | `v2-audit-report.md` (numbered findings against `ux-foundations.md`, each with P0/P1/P2 severity + tractability tag: auto / decision / new-token / new-component) | `/ux audit` on the v1 file |
| **Enhancement** | Skipped — parent feature's research already exists | — |
| **Fix / Chore** | Skipped | — |

For v2 refactors, the research phase is an **audit phase**, not a
market-research phase. The output drives the rest of the lifecycle: every
finding becomes a Phase 2 task, every P0/P1 finding becomes a required
Phase 4 patch, and Section A of
`docs/design-system/v2-refactor-checklist.md` is the completion gate.

### New-feature brainstorm preflight (v7.8.5+)

Before filling out the research template, run `/brainstorm-pm` to lock the problem framing, surface assumptions, and enumerate alternative solutions. The skill writes to `state.json::brainstorm.<mode>` which serves as input to Phase 1 PRD sections (see `.claude/skills/brainstorm-pm/SKILL.md` → §"Integration with /pm-workflow"). Skip only if the problem framing is already documented in a research/spec doc and validated externally.

**Three-option trade-off mode (added 2026-06-03):** when the problem is locked + scope is roughly known but the implementation path isn't, run `/brainstorm-pm three-option` to produce a UX / Design / Dev trade-off matrix across ≥3 distinct paths spanning the feasibility space. NO pre-ranking — output IS the matrix and the user picks. Matrix lands at `state.json::brainstorm.three_option_matrix` and renders as the PRD's §Alternatives considered section.

### Three-option auto-dispatch heuristic (added 2026-06-03)

Phase 0 auto-invokes `/brainstorm-pm three-option` **after** the 4-base-mode brainstorm pass completes, when the problem-shape signals are ambiguous. Decision tree the agent evaluates:

```
If state.json::brainstorm.problem_statement is set AND
   state.json::brainstorm.solution_alternatives.length ≥ 2:

   Skip three-option — solution mode already produced ranked candidates.

Else if work_type ∈ {feature, enhancement, refactor_v2} AND
        problem statement contains ≥1 of:
          • "could be A or B", "vs", "trade-off", "trade off", "alternative"
          • "implement", "build", "wire" + ≥2 distinct platform/surface terms
            (e.g. "iOS and Web", "in-app + cloud", "sync vs async")
          • backlog row has "alternatives considered" in scope
        OR the operator explicitly requests it ("/pm-workflow {name} --mode=three-option"):

   AUTO-INVOKE `/brainstorm-pm three-option`. Surface the matrix to the operator
   inline; require explicit pick before advancing to Phase 1.

Else if work_type == fix OR chore:
   DO NOT auto-invoke. (Three-option matrices have negative ROI on bug fixes —
   the answer is "fix the root cause" not "pick a trade-off".)

Otherwise:
   DEFAULT NO. The 4 base modes are enough; offer three-option as an explicit
   command (`/brainstorm-pm three-option`) without auto-dispatching.
```

**Fallback when heuristic mis-fires (matrix becomes ritual rather than discriminating):**
the operator can disable auto-dispatch for the current session via
`/pm-workflow {feature} --no-three-option`. Record the disable in
`state.json::brainstorm.three_option_skip_reason` so the kill-criterion
metric (per `brainstorm-pm/SKILL.md` Three-Option mode §Kill criterion) can
measure how often the operator overrides the heuristic. If override rate
exceeds 30% over a 30-day rolling window, the gate condition fires: narrow
the heuristic to require explicit operator opt-in instead of auto-dispatch.

**Telemetry:** Phase 0 emits one event per dispatch decision to
`gate-coverage.jsonl` with key `pm_workflow.three_option_auto_dispatch`
and outcome ∈ {invoked, skipped_solution_already_done, skipped_fix_chore,
skipped_default_no, operator_disabled, operator_explicit_request}. The
existing weekly framework-status cron tracks this alongside other gates.

### New-feature research template

Create `.claude/features/$0/research.md` using the research template. Fill in:

1. **What is this solution?** — Plain-language description
2. **Why this approach?** — Problem it solves, user pain points addressed
3. **Why this over alternatives?** — Research 2-3 alternative approaches. Create a comparison table:
   | Approach | Pros | Cons | Effort | Chosen? |
   |----------|------|------|--------|---------|
4. **External sources** — Search for relevant articles, documentation, APIs, libraries. Include links.
5. **Market examples** — How do competitors or other apps solve this? Include app names and what they do well/poorly.
6. **If this feature has UI:**
   - Search for design inspiration — find 3-5 examples of similar UI patterns you'd recommend
   - Document design solutions that could work (with reasoning)
   - Note visual references and mood (colors, layout patterns, interaction models)
   - Link to any Figma exploration
7. **Data & demand signals** — What data justifies building this? (user feedback, analytics, market size, support requests)
8. **Technical feasibility** — Dependencies, risks, unknowns, platform constraints
9. **Proposed success metrics** — Draft the primary metric and 2-3 secondary metrics
10. **Decision** — Recommended approach with rationale

Present the research to the user and ask for approval. **On approval, execute the Phase Transition Procedure (see Dashboard Sync Automation).**

---

## Phase 1: PRD

**Goal:** Define exactly what we're building with measurable success criteria.

Create `.claude/features/$0/prd.md` using the PRD template (see prd-template.md). Every field is mandatory.

**Critical:** The success metrics section is NON-NEGOTIABLE. No PRD is approved without:
- Primary metric with baseline and target
- Secondary metrics (2-3)
- Guardrail metrics (things that must not degrade)
- Leading indicators (measurable within 1 week)
- Lagging indicators (30/60/90 day impact)
- Instrumentation plan (how we measure)
- Review cadence
- Kill criteria

Ask the user: "Does this feature have a UI component?" → Set `has_ui` in state.json.

Ask the user: "Does this feature introduce new measurable interactions (screens, user actions, badges, achievements)?" → Set `requires_analytics` in state.json.

### Analytics Spec Gate (if requires_analytics = true)

Before the PRD can be approved, define and validate the GA4 analytics instrumentation for this feature:

1. **Read existing taxonomy** — Read `FitTracker/Services/Analytics/AnalyticsProvider.swift` (all enums: `AnalyticsEvent`, `AnalyticsParam`, `AnalyticsScreen`, `AnalyticsUserProperty`) and `docs/product/analytics-taxonomy.csv` to understand the current event landscape.

2. **Draft Analytics Spec** — For each measurable action in the PRD, fill in the "Analytics Spec (GA4 Event Definitions)" section of the PRD template:
   - New events (name, category, GA4 type, trigger screen, parameters, conversion flag)
   - New parameters (name, type, allowed values, which events use them)
   - New screens (snake_case name, SwiftUI view class, category)
   - New user properties (if any — remember max 25 total custom)

3. **Validate naming conventions** against GA4 rules documented in `AnalyticsProvider.swift`:
   - snake_case format, lowercase only
   - Max 40 characters for event and parameter names
   - No reserved prefixes (`ga_`, `firebase_`, `google_`)
   - No duplicate names against existing enums in `AnalyticsProvider.swift`
   - No PII in any parameter (no emails, names, phone numbers, user IDs)
   - Parameter values max 100 characters
   - Max 25 parameters per event
   - Total custom user properties still ≤25 after additions
   - Use GA4 recommended events where available (`login`, `sign_up`, `share`, `select_content`, `tutorial_begin`, `tutorial_complete`)

4. **Complete the Naming Validation Checklist** in the PRD (all boxes must be checked).

5. **Update state.json:** Set `phases.prd.analytics_spec_complete = true`.

**The PRD is NOT approvable until the Analytics Spec passes validation** (when `requires_analytics = true`). If `requires_analytics = false`, the Analytics Spec section is skipped.

Present the PRD and ask for approval. **On approval, execute the Phase Transition Procedure.**

---

## Phase 2: Task Breakdown

**Goal:** Divide the PRD into implementable subtasks.

Create `.claude/features/$0/tasks.md` with:
1. Read the approved PRD
2. Break into subtasks, each with: title, description, estimated effort, dependencies
3. Classify each task: `ui`, `backend`, `data`, `test`, `docs`, `infra`
4. Order by dependency graph
5. Estimate total effort
6. Assign each task a `skill` from: `dev`, `qa`, `design`, `analytics`, `ops`, `marketing`, `cx`, `research`, `release`
7. Identify task dependencies — which tasks must complete before others can start
8. Estimate effort in days for each task

**Structured Task State:** After creating tasks.md, also write the tasks to `state.json.tasks[]`:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "T1",
      "title": "Task title from tasks.md",
      "type": "ui|backend|analytics|test|design|docs|infra|research|marketing",
      "skill": "dev|qa|design|analytics|ops|marketing|cx|research|release",
      "status": "pending",
      "priority": "critical|high|medium|low",
      "effort_days": 0.5,
      "depends_on": [],
      "completed_at": null
    }
  ]
}
```

Task status lifecycle: `pending` → `ready` (all depends_on are done) → `in_progress` → `done`

If a task's dependencies cannot be met, set status to `blocked`.

Present task list and ask for approval. **On approval, execute the Phase Transition Procedure.**

---

## Phase 3: UX/UI Definition (if has_ui = true)

**Goal:** Define screens, components, and design requirements before coding — grounded in UX research and validated against the design system. The hub dispatches `/ux` and `/design` sub-commands in sequence, collects their artifacts, and presents the whole package for user approval before advancing.

### Phase 3 dispatch chain

| Step | Skill dispatch | Output | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3a | `/ux audit {feature}` *(v2 refactor only)* | `.claude/features/{f}/v2-audit-report.md` | User reviews audit findings |
| 3b | `/ux research {feature}` | `.claude/features/{f}/ux-research.md` | Principles identified |
| 3c | `/ux spec {feature}` | `.claude/features/{f}/ux-spec.md` | Spec covers all 5 states + a11y + principles |
| 3d | `/ux validate {feature}` | heuristic validation report in chat | No unresolved P0 violations |
| **3e** | **`/ux preflight {feature}`** *(v4.X — NEW)* | **`.claude/features/{f}/ux-preflight-audit-{date}.md` + `.claude/cache/_shared/ux-spec-preflight.json` entry** | **P0 unresolved → spec NOT approvable** |
| **3f** | **`/design preflight {feature}`** *(v4.X — NEW)* | **`.claude/features/{f}/design-preflight-{date}.md` + `.claude/shared/figma-bridge-status.json`** | **DS P0=0; Figma MCP liveness recorded; library accessibility recorded** |
| 3g | `/design audit` on the ux-spec | compliance report | Token, component, pattern, a11y, motion all pass |
| 3h | `/ux prompt {feature}` | `docs/prompts/ux/{date}-{f}-ux-build.md` | Handoff prompt ready |
| 3i | `/design prompt {feature}` | `docs/prompts/ui/{date}-{f}-design-build.md` | Handoff prompt ready |
| **3j** | **`/design build {feature}`** *(v4.X — auto-dispatched)* | **Figma screens (or saved prompt fallback) + `state.json.figma_node_ids` populated + row added to `figma-code-sync-status.md`** | **Either MCP build succeeds OR `state.json.figma_build_status = "deferred_to_prompt"` is set with the prompt ready for manual handoff** |
| 3k | Phase 3 approval | `state.json.phases.ux_or_integration.status = "approved"` | User approves; advance to Phase 4 |

Steps 3a-3d produce the spec; **steps 3e-3f are the v4.X preflight gates that prevent silent-pass errors (token/component/pattern existence + Figma MCP liveness)**; step 3g validates against the design system; steps 3h-3i produce the auto-generated build prompts; **step 3j auto-builds Figma frames** (or saves a portable prompt for manual handoff if MCP is down). UX prompts land in `docs/prompts/ux/`, design/UI prompts land in `docs/prompts/ui/`. Legacy flat files migrated to `docs/prompts/_legacy/`.

**v2 refactor note:** For `state.json.work_subtype == "v2_refactor"`, step 3a is non-skippable and its output drives steps 3b-3d. For `new_ui`, step 3a is skipped (no v1 to audit) and step 3b starts from the PRD.

**Why steps 3e + 3f exist (added v4.X, 2026-05-06):** During the import-training-plan resume, the v2 ux-spec.md was drafted referencing 4 tokens/components that didn't exist in the codebase (`AppRadius.pill`, `AppMotion.standardEase`, `SettingsActionLabel` with custom badge slot, toast component). The user-ordered pre-Phase-4 audit caught all 4 before code was written; without it, Phase 4 would have hit "no such symbol" errors. Steps 3e + 3f are that audit promoted from manual-on-request to a mechanical gate.

**Why step 3j exists (added v4.X):** Smart Reminders shipped 2026-04-29 with code-first; Figma followed manually. Push Notifications still pending Figma weeks later. Import-Training-Plan was missed entirely until the user flagged it post-Phase-5. Auto-dispatching `/design build` ensures Figma sync happens in Phase 3 (or is explicitly deferred with a written prompt) so Phase 6 (`/design pre-merge-review`) has ground truth.

### V1 vs V2 — refactor or new feature?

Before starting Phase 3, classify the work:

| Classification | Trigger | Phase 3 expectation | Phase 4 file convention |
|---|---|---|---|
| **New UI feature** | No existing v1 file for this surface | Phase 3 is non-skippable. Must produce `ux-spec.md` and pass the design system compliance gateway before any view code is written. | Single Swift file at the canonical path (e.g. `Views/Home/HomeView.swift`). Bottom-up from foundations. |
| **V2 refactor (UX Foundations alignment)** | An existing v1 Swift file for this surface needs alignment with `ux-foundations.md` | Phase 3 starts with a `v2-audit-report.md` walking the existing v1 file against `ux-foundations.md`, THEN produces `ux-spec.md` for the v2 file. | New file at `{originalDir}/v2/{SameFileName}.swift`. v1 file is **not** patched in place — it stays as a historical reference per the V2 Rule in CLAUDE.md. project.pbxproj is updated in the same commit that creates the v2 file: v2 added to Sources, v1 removed from Sources but kept as a PBXFileReference. |

Set `state.json.work_subtype` to either `"new_ui"` or `"v2_refactor"`. For `v2_refactor`, populate `state.json.v2_file_path` with the planned v2 file path (using the `v2/` subdirectory convention) before Phase 3 advances.

**Phase 3 also requires** the design system v2 refactor checklist
(`docs/design-system/v2-refactor-checklist.md`) to be referenced in
`ux-spec.md`. Each checkbox the spec touches must be addressed in Phase 4.

### Step 1: UX Research & Principles (dispatches `/ux research`)

For v2 refactors, dispatch `/ux audit` first to produce
`.claude/features/$0/v2-audit-report.md` as the gap-analysis driver.
Then dispatch `/ux research $0` to consolidate the audit findings into
applicable UX principles. For new UI features, go straight to
`/ux research $0`.

Before designing screens, research and document UX best practices relevant to this feature:

1. **UX principles applicable to this feature** — identify which core principles apply:
   - Fitts's Law (target size and distance for tap targets)
   - Hick's Law (minimize choices per screen)
   - Jakob's Law (users expect your app to work like others they know)
   - Progressive disclosure (show only what's needed at each step)
   - Recognition over recall (visible options vs memorized commands)
   - Consistency (internal consistency with FitMe, external with iOS conventions)
   - Feedback (every action gets a response)
   - Error prevention (design to prevent mistakes, not just handle them)

2. **iOS Human Interface Guidelines** — check Apple's HIG for relevant patterns:
   - Navigation patterns (push, modal, tab, sheet)
   - Input patterns (forms, pickers, steppers, sliders)
   - Feedback patterns (haptics, animations, alerts)
   - Accessibility requirements (Dynamic Type, VoiceOver, minimum tap targets 44pt)

3. **UX best practices for this feature type** — search for research and articles on the specific interaction pattern (e.g., "best practices for food logging UX", "training timer UI patterns")

4. **Document findings** in `.claude/features/$0/ux-research.md`:
   - Applicable principles and how they apply
   - iOS HIG references
   - External UX research sources with links
   - Recommended patterns based on research

### Step 2: Design Definition

Follow the Feature Development Gateway at `docs/design-system/feature-development-gateway.md`:
1. Problem framing (already done in PRD)
2. Behavior definition: entry points, primary task flow, edge cases, states (empty/loading/error/success)
3. Screen list with wireframe descriptions
4. Component inventory (reuse existing AppComponents where possible — check `FitTracker/DesignSystem/AppComponents.swift`)
5. Design token requirements (map to existing `AppTheme.swift` tokens; flag any new primitives needed)
6. User interaction flows
7. Accessibility requirements (informed by UX research from Step 1)
8. Reference the design inspiration from Phase 0 research
9. Reference the UX principles from Step 1 — explain HOW each principle influenced the design

Also walk through `docs/design-system/feature-design-checklist.md` for every UI decision.

Create `.claude/features/$0/ux-spec.md` with the above.

### Step 3: Design System Compliance Gateway

**Before approval, validate the design against the design system.**

Run a compliance check on the UX spec:

1. **Token compliance** — Every color, font, spacing, and radius value maps to an existing semantic token in `AppTheme.swift`. Flag any raw/hardcoded values.
2. **Component reuse** — Every UI element maps to an existing component in `AppComponents.swift` or has a documented reason for a new component.
3. **Pattern consistency** — Navigation, layout, and interaction patterns are consistent with existing screens (check `docs/design-system/component-contracts.md`).
4. **Accessibility compliance** — Minimum 44pt tap targets, WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1 text), Dynamic Type support, VoiceOver labels defined.
5. **Motion compliance** — Animations use `AppMotion` presets, reduce-motion support via `MotionSafe` modifier.

**Generate a compliance report:**

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Token compliance | Pass/Fail | {list any violations} |
| Component reuse | Pass/Fail | {new components needed?} |
| Pattern consistency | Pass/Fail | {deviations from existing patterns} |
| Accessibility | Pass/Fail | {issues found} |
| Motion | Pass/Fail | {non-standard animations?} |

**If all checks pass:** Present the UX spec for approval.

**If any checks fail:** Alert the user with the compliance report and present three options:

> **Design System Compliance Alert**
>
> The UX spec has {N} design system violations:
> {list violations}
>
> Since this feature is on its own branch, you have full flexibility:
>
> 1. **Fix violations** — Update the UX spec to comply with the current design system
> 2. **Evolve the design system** — The design system is a living framework. If these changes improve it, update the tokens/components as part of this feature. Document the evolution in `docs/design-system/feature-memory.md`
> 3. **Override with justification** — Proceed with the violations, documenting why the design system doesn't apply here (edge case, experimental, etc.)
>
> The design system should serve the product, not constrain it. Choose the path that makes the best product.

Record the user's decision in state.json under `ux_or_integration.compliance_decision`.

**Design system evolution rules:**
- New tokens/components proposed by a feature are added on the feature branch
- They are reviewed alongside the feature code in Phase 6
- If approved, they become part of the design system when the feature merges to main
- Update `docs/design-system/feature-memory.md` with what changed and why
- Run `make tokens-check` to verify token pipeline still passes

### Step 4: Generate handoff prompts (auto)

Once steps 1-3 are approved (ux-research.md, ux-spec.md, compliance gateway passed), dispatch both prompt-writer sub-commands in parallel:

```
/ux prompt $0       → writes docs/prompts/{YYYY-MM-DD}-$0-ux-build.md
/design prompt $0   → writes docs/prompts/{YYYY-MM-DD}-$0-design-build.md
```

Both prompts are ready to hand off to downstream agents (Figma MCP, SwiftUI implementation agent, etc.). The `/ux` prompt carries the what-and-why; the `/design` prompt carries the how-it-looks. Matching filename prefixes so the two can be read together.

**Verify both prompt files were written** before marking Phase 3 as approvable. If either file is missing, re-run the corresponding sub-command.

Present UX spec + compliance report + both handoff prompts, and ask for approval. **On approval, execute the Phase Transition Procedure.**

## Phase 3b: Integration Requirements (if has_ui = false)

**Goal:** Define technical contracts and integration points.

Create `.claude/features/$0/integration-spec.md` with:
1. API contracts (endpoints, payloads, auth)
2. Data model changes (new models, migrations)
3. Service dependencies
4. Error handling strategy
5. Backward compatibility plan

Present spec and ask for approval. **On approval, execute the Phase Transition Procedure.**

---

## Phase 4: Branch & Implement

**Goal:** Write the code on an isolated branch.

1. Create branch: `git checkout -b feature/$0 main`

### V2 Refactor — file convention (per CLAUDE.md V2 Rule)

If `state.json.work_subtype == "v2_refactor"`:

1. **Do not modify the v1 file in place.** v1 stays read-only during the
   refactor. The audit (`v2-audit-report.md` from Phase 3) is the gap
   analysis; the v2 file is built bottom-up from the design system
   foundations.

2. **Create the v2 file in a `v2/` subdirectory** next to v1, keeping the
   original file name. Path is `state.json.v2_file_path` and follows the
   pattern `{originalDir}/v2/{SameFileName}.swift`. Both files define
   the same Swift type — only the directory differs.

3. **Update `FitTracker.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` in the same commit:**
   - Add a new PBXGroup for the `v2/` directory under the parent group
   - Add a PBXFileReference for the new v2 file under that PBXGroup
   - Add a PBXBuildFile entry referencing the new v2 file
   - Add the new PBXBuildFile to the Sources build phase
   - **Remove** the v1 file's PBXBuildFile from the Sources build phase
     (the v1 PBXFileReference and group entry stay so the file shows in
     the navigator and git diffs cleanly)

4. **Mark v1 as historical** with a header comment when v2 is functionally
   complete:
   ```swift
   // HISTORICAL — superseded by v2/{ScreenName}.swift on {date} per
   // UX Foundations alignment pass. See
   // .claude/features/{name}/v2-audit-report.md for the gap analysis.
   // This file is no longer in the build target; it stays in the repo
   // as a reviewable reference for the v1 → v2 diff.
   ```

5. **Parent views need no call-site changes.** Both v1 and v2 declare the
   same Swift type (e.g. `MainScreenView`) — RootTabView keeps writing
   `MainScreenView()` but the symbol now resolves to the v2 file because
   v1 is no longer in Sources. The swap happens entirely in
   project.pbxproj.

6. **Walk the v2 refactor checklist** at
   `docs/design-system/v2-refactor-checklist.md` before requesting Phase 5
   (Test) approval. Set
   `state.json.phases.implementation.checklist_completed = true` when all
   applicable boxes are ticked.

### Task Complexity Classifier (v5.1 — ARM big.LITTLE)

Before dispatching ready tasks, classify each one as **lightweight** (E-core, parallel lane) or **heavyweight** (P-core, serial lane). This ensures small/simple tasks don't block behind large/complex ones, and heavyweight tasks get full dedicated attention.

#### Classification Protocol

1. **Compute the ready set** — tasks where ALL entries in `depends_on` have status `done`
2. **For each ready task, score heavyweight indicators** from `skill-routing.json` → `task_complexity_gate.classification`:

   | Indicator | Weight | How to detect |
   |-----------|--------|--------------|
   | `files_changed_gt_5` | 2 | Task description mentions 5+ files, new screens, or broad refactor |
   | `new_model_or_service` | 3 | Task creates a new Swift model, service class, or manager |
   | `token_budget_high` | 2 | Task requires architecture decisions, research synthesis, or deep reasoning |
   | `cross_feature_deps` | 2 | Task's `depends_on` references tasks from a different feature |
   | `requires_judgment` | 3 | Task involves UX heuristic evaluation, risk assessment, or kill criteria review |

3. **Sum the weights** of all matched heavyweight indicators
4. **Classify:**
   - Score >= 4 → **Heavyweight** (P-core, serial lane)
   - Score < 4 → **Lightweight** (E-core, parallel lane)

#### Quick Classification Examples

| Task | Indicators matched | Score | Lane |
|------|--------------------|-------|------|
| "Add GA4 event for button tap" | files_changed ≤2, mechanical | 0 | E-core (parallel) |
| "Update analytics-taxonomy.csv" | config change, mechanical | 0 | E-core (parallel) |
| "Build new ProfileEditor screen" | new_model(3) + files>5(2) + judgment(3) | 8 | P-core (serial) |
| "Implement auth passkey flow" | new_service(3) + token_high(2) + cross_feature(2) | 7 | P-core (serial) |
| "Rename token AppColor.old → .new" | files ≤2, mechanical | 0 | E-core (parallel) |
| "Design ux-spec for new feature" | judgment(3) + token_high(2) | 5 | P-core (serial) |

#### Lane Execution

After classification, present both lanes to the user and execute:

```
Phase 4 — Task Dispatch (big.LITTLE)

  E-core lane (parallel, sonnet):
    T3 (add GA4 event)    — score 0, lightweight
    T5 (update taxonomy)  — score 0, lightweight
    T7 (rename token)     — score 0, lightweight

  P-core lane (serial, opus):
    T1 (build ProfileEditor) — score 8, heavyweight
    T4 (auth passkey flow)   — score 7, heavyweight

  Blocked:
    T8 (unit tests) — needs T1, T4
```

1. **Execute E-core lane first** — all lightweight tasks in parallel (max 5 concurrent). Use model tier: **sonnet**. If multiple lightweight tasks match a `batch_dispatch` operation, batch them (Item 3 composition).
2. **Then execute P-core lane** — heavyweight tasks one at a time with full context. Use model tier: **opus**.
3. **On each task completion** — recompute ready set, re-classify newly unblocked tasks, add to appropriate lane.
4. **Phase 4 is complete** when ALL tasks (both lanes) have status `done`.

#### Composition with Other v5.1 Items

- **Item 5 (Model Tiering):** E-core lane → sonnet, P-core lane → opus (overrides phase-level tier)
- **Item 3 (Batch Dispatch):** Multiple E-core tasks targeting the same skill can batch (e.g., 3 analytics taxonomy updates → single batch)
- **Item 4 (Result Forwarding):** P-core tasks in a chain forward results inline
- **Item 7 (Systolic Chains):** P-core tasks that match a defined chain execute in systolic mode

**Fallback:** If `task_complexity_gate` is missing or `enabled` is `false`, skip classification and use the standard parallel dispatch below (v5.1 behavior).

### Parallel Task Dispatch (Legacy — used when complexity gate is disabled)

When the Task Complexity Classifier above is disabled or missing, Phase 4 falls back to dependency-aware parallel execution without lane separation:

1. **Compute the ready set** — tasks where ALL entries in `depends_on` have status `done`
2. **Group by skill** — organize ready tasks by their `skill` field
3. **Present to user:**
   ```
   Ready to run in parallel:
     /dev:       T1 (container view), T2 (welcome screen), T3 (goals screen)
     /design:    T9 (progress bar component)
   Blocked (waiting on dependencies):
     /analytics: T8 (GA4 events) — needs T1, T2
     /qa:        T10 (unit tests) — needs T1-T9
   ```
4. **Execute ready tasks** — work on ready tasks, potentially across skills
5. **On each task completion:**
   - Set task `status: "done"` and `completed_at: timestamp`
   - Recompute the ready set (completed task may unblock others)
   - Present newly unblocked tasks
6. **Rebuild cross-feature queue** — update `.claude/shared/task-queue.json`
7. **Phase 4 is complete** when ALL tasks have status `done`

### Cross-Feature Priority Queue

After any task state change, rebuild `.claude/shared/task-queue.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "updated": "{timestamp}",
  "queue": [
    {
      "feature": "feature-name",
      "task_id": "T1",
      "title": "Task title",
      "skill": "dev",
      "work_type": "feature",
      "priority_score": 8,
      "status": "ready",
      "effort_days": 0.5
    }
  ],
  "scoring": {
    "base": { "critical": 10, "high": 7, "medium": 4, "low": 1 },
    "work_type_boost": { "fix": 3, "enhancement": 1, "feature": 0, "chore": -1 }
  }
}
```

Priority score = `base[priority] + work_type_boost[work_type]`. Fixes automatically jump the queue.

2. Implement according to the approved task list
3. Commit incrementally with descriptive messages
4. Update state.json with commit hashes
5. Follow the branching rules:
   - Features touching >5 files OR adding new models/services → MUST use `feature/{name}` branch
   - Both the feature branch and main must remain CI-green

Present implementation summary and ask for approval. **On approval, execute the Phase Transition Procedure.**

---

## Phase 5: Testing & Measurement

**Goal:** Verify the implementation works and metrics are instrumented.

1. Write unit tests for new functionality
2. Run the full CI suite: `make tokens-check && xcodebuild build && xcodebuild test`
3. Run regression check (existing tests still pass)
4. **Verify metric instrumentation is in place** — can we actually measure the success metrics defined in the PRD?
5. **Record baseline values** for all metrics before the feature is live
6. Update state.json: `ci_passed`, `tests_added`, `instrumentation_verified`

### Analytics Verification (if requires_analytics = true)

After general tests pass, run dedicated analytics verification:

1. **Unit test event firing** — For each event defined in the PRD's Analytics Spec:
   - Create a test in `FitTrackerTests/AnalyticsTests.swift` (create the file if it doesn't exist — first feature bootstraps it)
   - Construct a `MockAnalyticsAdapter` and inject it via `AnalyticsService(provider: mockAdapter, consent: consentManager)`
   - Trigger the action that should fire the event
   - Assert `mockAdapter.capturedEvents` contains the event with the correct name
   - Assert all expected parameters are present with correct types and values
   - Assert no unexpected parameters leak through

2. **Screen tracking verification** — For each new screen in the Analytics Spec:
   - Call the screen tracking method (or trigger `.analyticsScreen()` modifier)
   - Assert `mockAdapter.capturedScreens` contains the expected screen name

3. **Consent gating verification** — For at least one representative event per feature:
   - Set consent to denied → trigger the action → assert event is NOT in `capturedEvents`
   - Set consent to granted → trigger the action → assert event IS in `capturedEvents`
   - This validates the consent gate works end-to-end

4. **Taxonomy sync check** — Verify code and documentation are in sync:
   - Every event in the Analytics Spec has a corresponding constant in `AnalyticsEvent` enum (`AnalyticsProvider.swift`)
   - Every event has a row in `docs/product/analytics-taxonomy.csv`
   - Every new screen has entries in both `AnalyticsScreen` enum and the CSV screens section
   - Every new parameter has a constant in `AnalyticsParam` enum

5. **Update state.json:** Set `analytics_tests_added` (count of tests written) and `analytics_verification_passed = true`

**The phase is NOT approvable if `analytics_verification_passed = false`** (when `requires_analytics = true`).

If CI fails, fix and re-run. Do NOT proceed until CI is green.

Present test results and ask for approval. **On approval, execute the Phase Transition Procedure.**

---

## Phase 6: Code Review + UI Review

**Goal:** Parallel code-review + UI-specific review of the feature branch vs main to catch risk before merge.

### Phase 6 dispatch chain (v4.X — UI review layer added)

| Step | Skill / step | Output | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6a | Generic diff + risk surface | risk report in chat | High-risk areas surfaced |
| **6b** | **`/ux pre-merge-review {feature}`** *(v4.X — NEW)* | **`.claude/features/{f}/ux-pre-merge-review-{date}.md` + `state.json.pre_merge_review.ux`** | **Heuristic re-check vs ux-spec.md; spec drift catalogued; verdict PASS / PASS_WITH_NOTES / BLOCK** |
| **6c** | **`/design pre-merge-review {feature}`** *(v4.X — NEW)* | **`.claude/features/{f}/design-pre-merge-review-{date}.md` + `state.json.pre_merge_review.design`** | **`make ui-audit` P0=0; Figma node IDs present in `state.json.figma_node_ids`; PR description references those IDs; optional screenshot diff via Figma MCP** |
| 6d | CI status check on both branches | green status on feature + main | Both branches CI-green |
| 6e | Phase 6 approval | `state.json.phases.review.status = "approved"` | User approves; both `pre_merge_review.ux` AND `pre_merge_review.design` must be `passed` (or `passed_with_notes`); BLOCK on either prevents Phase 7 |

### Detailed steps

1. **6a — Generic diff + risk surface:**
   - `git diff main...feature/$0 --stat`
   - Identify high-risk areas:
     - Changes to models (`DomainModels.swift`)
     - Changes to encryption (`EncryptionService.swift`)
     - Changes to sync (`SupabaseSyncService.swift`, `CloudKitSyncService.swift`)
     - Changes to auth (`SignInService.swift`, `AuthManager.swift`)
     - Changes to AI (`AIOrchestrator.swift`)
2. **6b — UX pre-merge review:**
   - Dispatch `/ux pre-merge-review {feature}` (loads `/ux` skill)
   - Skill reads `ux-spec.md`, walks the heuristic checklist against the actual implementation, spot-checks file:line touch points named in the spec, verifies all 5 states are covered in code
   - Verdict written to `state.json.pre_merge_review.ux`. BLOCK halts the chain.
3. **6c — Design pre-merge review:**
   - Dispatch `/design pre-merge-review {feature}` (loads `/design` skill)
   - Skill verifies `make ui-audit` is clean against the feature's view files, that `state.json.figma_node_ids` is populated, that the PR description references those IDs, and (optionally) does a screenshot diff via `mcp__claude_ai_Figma__get_screenshot`
   - Verdict written to `state.json.pre_merge_review.design`. BLOCK halts the chain.
4. **6d — CI check on both branches:**
   - Feature branch: green
   - Main branch: green
5. **6e — Aggregate verdict:**
   - All four (6a, 6b, 6c, 6d) must pass before user approval is requested
   - List risks + mitigations + UI drift findings + design system findings

**Phase 7 (Merge) is NOT approvable** until both `state.json.pre_merge_review.ux` and `state.json.pre_merge_review.design` are `passed` or `passed_with_notes`.

**Why 6b + 6c exist (added v4.X, 2026-05-06):** Phase 6 was a generic code-review step; UI drift between spec and shipped code was caught only by manual eyeballing during Phase 5 (Testing) — and missed entirely on import-training-plan until the user flagged the missing Figma sync post-merge. Steps 6b + 6c make UI review mechanical and gate-able, paired with the v4.X Phase 3 preflight gates (3e + 3f) so the spec-vs-code contract holds across both surfaces.

Present review and ask for approval. **On approval, execute the Phase Transition Procedure.**

---

## Phase 7: Merge

**Goal:** Merge the feature to main cleanly.

1. Create PR with title: `feat($0): {one-line description}`
2. PR body: link to PRD, task list, test results, risk assessment
3. Squash merge to main
4. Delete feature branch
5. Update state.json: `pr_number`

### Post-Merge Analytics Regression (if requires_analytics = true)

After the merge to main is complete, verify analytics integrity on the merged branch:

1. **Switch to main** — `git checkout main && git pull origin main`

2. **Run analytics test suite on main** — Execute all tests in `FitTrackerTests/AnalyticsTests.swift`:
   - All pre-existing analytics events still fire correctly (no regressions from the merge)
   - All new events from this feature work on the main branch
   - Screen tracking for both existing and new screens works
   - Consent gating still functions

3. **Taxonomy completeness check** — Programmatically verify code ↔ documentation sync:
   - Every constant in `AnalyticsEvent` enum has a corresponding row in the events section of `analytics-taxonomy.csv`
   - Every constant in `AnalyticsScreen` enum has a row in the screens section
   - Every constant in `AnalyticsUserProperty` enum has a row in the user properties section
   - Report any orphaned constants (in code but not CSV) or missing rows (in CSV but not code)

4. **Update state.json:** Set `phases.merge.analytics_regression_passed = true/false`

**If regression fails:** Alert the user with the specific failures. Recommend either:
- Fix on main directly (if trivial — e.g., missing CSV row)
- Create a hotfix branch for non-trivial issues

---

## Phase 8: Documentation & Metrics

**Goal:** Close the loop with documentation and metric baselines.

1. Update the feature PRD with final implementation state
2. Record baseline metric values in state.json
3. Set first review date (based on review cadence from PRD)
4. Update CHANGELOG.md with the feature
5. Update docs/product/backlog.md (move from Planned → Done)
6. Archive: move state.json `current_phase` to `complete`

Announce: "Feature **$0** is complete. First metrics review scheduled for {date}."

---

## Post-Launch: Metrics Review

When the review cadence date arrives:
1. Read state.json metrics
2. Compare current values against baseline and target
3. Check kill criteria
4. Report: keep / iterate / kill recommendation

---

## Rules

- **No phase is skipped by default.** The automated workflow enforces sequential gates. Manual overrides are allowed — skipped phases are marked as "skipped" with a reason in the audit trail. The user always has final authority.
- **No PRD without metrics.** Every feature must define how success is measured.
- **No merge without CI.** Both feature branch and main must be green.
- **Data drives decisions.** Research, metrics, and kill criteria guide the lifecycle.
- **User approves every gate.** No autonomous phase transitions.

---

## Dashboard Sync Automation

### How Phase Transitions Work

When a phase is approved and the feature moves to the next phase, **three things happen automatically:**

1. **state.json updates** — `current_phase` advances, previous phase gets `status: "approved"` + timestamp
2. **GitHub Issue label updates** — the feature's GitHub Issue gets its `phase:*` label swapped (e.g., `phase:prd` → `phase:tasks`)
3. **Transition log entry** — a timestamped record is appended to the `transitions` array in state.json

### Phase Transition Procedure

On every phase approval, execute this procedure:

```
1. Read current state.json
2. Record the transition:
   - Set phases.{current_phase}.status = "approved"
   - Set phases.{current_phase}.approved_at = current timestamp
   - Determine next_phase from the phase order (see below)
   - Set current_phase = next_phase
   - Set phases.{next_phase}.status = "in_progress"
   - Set updated = current timestamp
   - Append to transitions array: { from, to, timestamp, approved_by: "user" }
3. Write updated state.json
4. Sync to GitHub Issue (if GitHub MCP tools are available):
   - Find the issue for this feature (by title match or issue number in state.json)
   - Remove old phase label (e.g., `phase:prd`)
   - Add new phase label (e.g., `phase:tasks`)
   - Add a comment: "Phase transition: {from} → {to} (approved {timestamp})"
5. Announce: "✓ Phase {from} approved. Moving to Phase {next}: {description}."
```

### External Tool Sync (Auto)

After every Phase Transition Procedure completes (steps 1-5 above), execute these additional sync steps:

4. **Notion sync** — Search for the feature's Notion page via `notion-search` (query: feature name). If found, update it with `notion-update-page`: set the phase/status property to the new `current_phase` and add a comment with the transition details.
5. **Vercel notification** — No explicit action required. Merging to main auto-triggers a Vercel deploy. During the merge phase, remind the user that deploy will happen automatically on push.
6. **Figma sync note** — If `has_ui = true` and the completed phase is `implement`, remind the user to update the Figma file with the final design using the `figma-generate-design` skill (`/figma generate-design`).

### Phase Order

The canonical phase sequence is:

```
research → prd → tasks → ux (if has_ui) → implement → testing → review → merge → docs → complete
                          └→ integration (if !has_ui) ─┘
```

Index mapping for ordering:
| Index | Phase | Label |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 0 | research | `phase:research` |
| 1 | prd | `phase:prd` |
| 2 | tasks | `phase:tasks` |
| 3 | ux / integration | `phase:ux` or `phase:integration` |
| 4 | implement | `phase:implement` |
| 5 | testing | `phase:testing` |
| 6 | review | `phase:review` |
| 7 | merge | `phase:merge` |
| 8 | docs | `phase:docs` |
| 9 | complete | `phase:done` |

### Manual Override: Moving Forward or Backward

The user can manually move a feature to any phase at any time. This supports:
- **Skipping ahead** (e.g., a hotfix doesn't need UX research)
- **Rolling back** (e.g., implementation revealed the PRD was wrong, go back to PRD)
- **Dashboard drag-drop** (user drags a card to a different column)

**To manually override via the skill:**
```
/pm-workflow {feature-name}
```
Then tell Claude: "Move this feature to {phase}" or "Roll back to {phase}".

**Manual override procedure:**
```
1. Read current state.json
2. Validate the target phase exists in the phase order
3. If moving BACKWARD:
   - Set all phases between target and current back to "pending"
   - Set target phase to "in_progress"
   - Log transition with approved_by: "user-manual"
   - Warn: "Rolling back to {phase}. Phases {list} have been reset to pending."
4. If moving FORWARD (skipping phases):
   - Set all skipped phases to "skipped" with reason: "manual-override"
   - Set target phase to "in_progress"
   - Log transition with approved_by: "user-manual"
   - Warn: "Skipping phases {list}. These are marked as skipped."
5. Write updated state.json
6. Sync GitHub Issue labels (same as automatic transition)
7. Announce the change
```

**Via dashboard drag-drop:**
When the dashboard writes a label change to GitHub, the next time the skill runs it will:
1. Read state.json
2. Detect that the GitHub Issue label doesn't match `current_phase`
3. Ask the user: "GitHub shows this feature in {phase} but state.json says {other_phase}. Which is correct?"
4. Reconcile based on user choice

### Transition Log (audit trail)

state.json includes a `transitions` array that records every phase change:

```json
{
  "transitions": [
    {
      "from": "research",
      "to": "prd",
      "timestamp": "2026-04-02T18:45:00Z",
      "approved_by": "user",
      "note": ""
    },
    {
      "from": "prd",
      "to": "tasks",
      "timestamp": "2026-04-02T19:30:00Z",
      "approved_by": "user",
      "note": ""
    },
    {
      "from": "tasks",
      "to": "research",
      "timestamp": "2026-04-03T10:00:00Z",
      "approved_by": "user-manual",
      "note": "PRD scope changed, need to re-research alternatives"
    }
  ]
}
```

### GitHub Label Convention

For the dashboard to read feature phases from GitHub Issues, use these labels:

| Label | Color | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `phase:research` | #9CA3AF (gray) | Phase 0 |
| `phase:prd` | #9CA3AF (gray) | Phase 1 |
| `phase:tasks` | #9CA3AF (gray) | Phase 2 |
| `phase:ux` | #3B82F6 (blue) | Phase 3 |
| `phase:integration` | #3B82F6 (blue) | Phase 3b |
| `phase:implement` | #3B82F6 (blue) | Phase 4 |
| `phase:testing` | #A855F7 (purple) | Phase 5 |
| `phase:review` | #A855F7 (purple) | Phase 6 |
| `phase:merge` | #A855F7 (purple) | Phase 7 |
| `phase:docs` | #10B981 (green) | Phase 8 |
| `phase:done` | #10B981 (green) | Complete |
| `priority:critical` | #DC2626 (red) | P0 |
| `priority:high` | #F59E0B (amber) | P1 |
| `priority:medium` | #FBBF24 (yellow) | P2 |
| `priority:low` | #D1D5DB (gray) | P3 |

### Conflict Resolution

When state.json and GitHub Issue disagree:

| Scenario | Resolution |
|----------|-----------|
| state.json ahead of GitHub | Auto-sync: update GitHub label to match state.json |
| GitHub ahead of state.json | Ask user: "Dashboard moved this feature. Accept?" |
| Both changed since last sync | Ask user to choose which source is correct |
| state.json missing, GitHub exists | Create state.json from GitHub Issue data |
| GitHub Issue missing, state.json exists | Offer to create GitHub Issue from state.json |

## External Data Sources (Reactive Data Mesh)

The hub receives notifications from ALL integration adapters when new external data enters the system. The hub does NOT pull data itself — it is notified by the receiving skill and the validation gate.

### How Data Flows to the Hub

1. **Any entry point triggers data flow.** A user invokes a single skill (e.g., `/analytics validate`) or an MCP connects for the first time.
2. **The adapter normalizes and validates.** Raw MCP data → `schema.json` → `mapping.json` → validation gate.
3. **The validation gate scores consistency** against all existing shared layer state.
4. **The hub is always notified.** Both the receiving skill and `/pm-workflow` are informed of the result.

### Validation Gate Thresholds

| Score | Alert | Data Written? | Hub Action |
|-------|-------|---------------|------------|
| >= 95% | GREEN | Yes | Log. No action needed. |
| 90-95% | ORANGE | Yes | Log + surface advisory to user at next interaction. |
| < 90% | RED | No | STOP. Present conflict details. User must resolve before data enters shared layer. |

**Validation is automatic. Resolution is always manual.** The hub never silently resolves conflicts or auto-corrects data.

### Integration Adapters Available

| Adapter | Consuming Skills | Shared Layer Target |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| ga4 | /analytics, /pm-workflow, /cx | metric-status.json |
| app-store-connect | /cx, /release, /marketing | cx-signals.json, feature-registry.json |
| sentry | /ops, /cx, /qa | health-status.json, cx-signals.json |
| firecrawl | /research, /marketing | context.json, feature-registry.json |
| axe | /ux, /qa, /design | design-system.json, test-coverage.json |
| security-audit | /dev, /ops, /qa | health-status.json, test-coverage.json |
| figma | /design | design-system.json |
| linear | /pm-workflow | feature-registry.json, task-queue.json |
| notion | /pm-workflow | feature-registry.json |

### Adapter Configuration

Adapters live in `.claude/integrations/{service}/` with:
- `adapter.md` — how to call the MCP/API
- `schema.json` — expected response shape
- `mapping.json` — field mapping to shared layer

If an adapter is not configured (no API keys), skills degrade gracefully — they use existing shared layer data.

## Research Scope (Phase 2)

When the cache doesn't have an answer for an orchestration task, research:

1. **Phase gating** — which phases to include for this work type (Feature/Enhancement/Fix/Chore), gate requirements
2. **Skill dispatch** — which skills to involve, task routing via skill-routing.json, parallel vs sequential execution
3. **Cross-feature context** — related features in feature-registry.json, shared dependencies, potential conflicts
4. **Tools & integrations** — Linear MCP for issue sync, Notion MCP for PRD sync, GitHub for CI/PR management
5. **Process optimization** — what worked/failed in prior features of similar scope, phase duration baselines

Sources checked in order: L1 cache → L2/L3 cache → shared layer (feature-registry.json, skill-routing.json) → integration adapters (linear, notion) → codebase → external docs

## Cache Protocol

### Phase 1 (Cache Check — Hub Invocation)

1. **Read** `.claude/cache/pm-workflow/_index.json` for cached orchestration patterns.
2. **Read** `.claude/cache/_shared/` for cross-skill patterns relevant to the current phase.
3. **Read** `.claude/cache/_project/` for project-wide architectural decisions.
4. If a cache hit matches the current task signature → load learned patterns and skip derivation.

### Phase 4 (Learn — Hub Completion, phase transition)

1. **Extract** any new patterns or anti-patterns discovered during the phase.
2. **Write** or update the relevant L1 cache entry in `.claude/cache/pm-workflow/`.
3. **Check** if any pattern was used by 2+ skills during this phase → promote to L2 (`_shared/`).
4. **Log** the cache interaction in the phase's state.json entry.

### Cache Location

- L1 (hub-specific): `.claude/cache/pm-workflow/`
- L2 (cross-skill): `.claude/cache/_shared/`
- L3 (project-wide): `.claude/cache/_project/`

## Cross-Skill Cache Promotion

The hub is responsible for detecting cross-skill pattern convergence:

1. After each phase completes, scan L1 caches of skills involved in that phase.
2. If 2+ skills cached the same pattern (by `task_signature.type`) → create/update L2 entry.
3. If an L2 entry is referenced by 5+ skills → promote to L3.
4. Promotion is logged in `change-log.json` as a `cache_promotion` event.

---

## Cache Protocol

### Phase 1 — Cache Check (on skill start)
1. Read `.claude/cache/pm-workflow/_index.json` for L1 entries
2. Match current task against `task_signature.type`
3. Check L2 `.claude/cache/_shared/` for cross-skill patterns
4. If hit: load `learned_patterns`, `anti_patterns`, `speedup_instructions`
5. Apply loaded patterns — skip derivation steps covered by cache
6. If miss: proceed to Phase 2 (Research)

### Phase 4 — Learn (on skill complete)
1. Extract new patterns and anti-patterns from this execution
2. Write or update L1 cache entry in `.claude/cache/pm-workflow/`
3. If pattern overlaps with an existing L2 entry, increment `hit_count`
4. If a new pattern applies to 2+ skills, flag for L2 promotion

### Health Check (Phase 0 — random trigger)
On skill start, before cache check:
1. Read `.claude/shared/framework-health.json`
2. If `random() < 0.25` AND `hours_since(last_check) > 2`: run 5 health checks, compute weighted score, append to history
3. If score < 0.90: STOP and alert user with failing checks and rollback options
4. Proceed to Phase 1 (Cache Check)

## External Data Sources

| Adapter | Location | Shared Layer Target | When to Pull |
|---------|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| ga4 | `.claude/integrations/ga4/` | metric-status.json | On any phase transition or validation gate alert |
| app-store-connect | `.claude/integrations/app-store-connect/` | cx-signals.json, feature-registry.json | On any phase transition or validation gate alert |
| sentry | `.claude/integrations/sentry/` | health-status.json, cx-signals.json | On any phase transition or validation gate alert |
| firecrawl | `.claude/integrations/firecrawl/` | context.json, feature-registry.json | On any phase transition or validation gate alert |
| axe | `.claude/integrations/axe/` | design-system.json, test-coverage.json | On any phase transition or validation gate alert |
| security-audit | `.claude/integrations/security-audit/` | health-status.json, test-coverage.json | On any phase transition or validation gate alert |

**Fallback:** If adapter unavailable, continue with existing shared data. Log to change-log.json.

## Research Scope (Phase 2 — when cache misses)

1. Phase transition patterns from state.json history
2. Work type selection heuristics
3. Task decomposition patterns from prior features
4. Priority scoring from task-queue.json
5. Change broadcast and notification rules

**Source priority:** L2 cache > L1 cache > shared layer (all files) > all adapters


## Anti-patterns

Hard-won mistakes for `/pm-workflow` work. Every bullet encodes a real or near-miss failure mode.

- Do not skip a phase without recording the skip reason in `state.json::phases.<name>.skip_reason` — the audit trail is part of the framework contract
- Do not advance `current_phase` without a corresponding event in `.claude/logs/<feature>.log.json` within 15 minutes — pre-commit gate `PHASE_TRANSITION_NO_LOG` blocks this since v7.6
- Do not advance to `current_phase=complete` without resolving `kill_criteria_resolution` when `kill_criteria` is set in state.json (pattern #6 `FEATURE_CLOSURE_COMPLETENESS`)
- Do not dispatch parallel subagents while upstream tickets F6–F9 are still active — default to serial dispatch per `docs/framework-bugs/concurrent-dispatch-blockers.md`
- Do not mark a UI feature `complete` without confirming BOTH `/ux pre-merge-review` AND `/design pre-merge-review` pass — the gates are not redundant
