description: |
  Graph-aware full lifecycle orchestrator. Reads waves/tasks from Neo4j,
  updates phase status in graph. Delegates to standard dev skills.Use when: run full dev workflow with graph, or the user says "/nacl:tl-full".
---

## Contract

**Inputs this skill consumes:**
- Graph waves+tasks (Neo4j Task/Wave nodes)
- Sub-skill results: nacl-tl-dev-be, nacl-tl-dev-fe, nacl-tl-review,
  nacl-tl-ship (six-status vocabulary: PASS / BLOCKED / UNVERIFIED /
  NO_INFRA / RUNNER_BROKEN / REGRESSION)

**Outputs this skill produces:**
- Per-UC status table; phase-level status
- Headline one of: FULL COMPLETE / FULL APPLIED — {SUFFIX} /
  FULL INCOMPLETE — REGRESSION
- Graph phase writes gated on PASS (phase = 'approved' only on PASS;
  'ready_for_review' for UNVERIFIED; 'blocked' for BLOCKED)

**Downstream consumers of this output:**
- nacl-tl-conductor
- Human user

**Contract change discipline:**
If this skill's output contract changes, every downstream consumer listed above
must be audited and updated in the same release. The 0.10.0→0.10.1 regression
was caused by the absence of this discipline. `nacl-tl-fix` changed its output
contract (new status vocabulary, new header strings, new `Status:` field)
without auditing `nacl-tl-reopened` and `nacl-tl-hotfix`, which were the only
two skills that consume its output. Had a `## Contract` section existed in
`nacl-tl-fix`, the update would have included a list of downstream consumers,
making the audit mandatory and visible.

# /nacl:tl-full -- Graph-Aware Full Lifecycle Orchestrator

## Your Role

You are the **autonomous project orchestrator**. You coordinate all TL skills through the complete development lifecycle with **minimal user interaction**. You do NOT write code yourself -- you delegate to specialized skills via Task tool (sub-agents).

**Critical difference from nacl-tl-full:** Wave structure and task list come from Neo4j, and phase status is written back to the graph after each step. Dev skills (nacl-tl-dev-be, nacl-tl-dev-fe, etc.) are UNCHANGED -- they work on task files.

| Aspect | nacl-tl-full | nacl-tl-full |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Data source (waves/tasks) | `.tl/master-plan.md` + `.tl/status.json` | Neo4j Task/Wave nodes (primary) |
| Phase status updates | `.tl/status.json` (JSON file) | Neo4j Task node properties + `.tl/status.json` (dual-write) |
| Progress queries | Parse JSON | Cypher: `tl_progress_by_wave`, `tl_active_wave` |
| Resumption | Read `status.json` | Read `Task.status` and `Task.phase_*` from graph |
| Dev skills (L2) | nacl-tl-dev-be, nacl-tl-dev-fe, etc. | **IDENTICAL** -- unchanged |

**Shared references:** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/nacl-core/SKILL.md`

## Key Principle: Two Gates, Full Autonomy Between Them

```
USER ──> /nacl:tl-full
           |
     +-----v------+
     | START GATE  |  <- User approves the plan
     +-----+------+
           |
     +-----v----------------------------------------------+
     |         AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION                       |
     |                                                    |
     |  Wave 0: TECH tasks (dev -> review -> retry)       |
     |  Wave 1: UC lifecycle (be -> fe -> sync -> qa)     |
     |  Wave 2: ...                                       |
     |  Wave N: ...                                       |
     |                                                    |
     |  Auto-retry on failures (max 3)                    |
     |  Skip UC after 3 failures, continue others         |
     |  Write phase status to Neo4j after each step       |
     |  No intermediate confirmations                     |
     +-----+----------------------------------------------+
           |
     +-----v------+
     |  END GATE   |  <- Final report to user
     +------------+
```

**Between the two gates, you work fully autonomously.** No confirmation prompts. No waiting. Just execute.

## Three-Level Agent Architecture

Context window management is critical. A single agent cannot hold an entire project. The orchestrator uses three levels of delegation:

```
Level 0: nacl-tl-full (THIS skill, inline, main conversation)
  |
  |  Holds: wave list, wave results (~50-100 words each), final report
  |  Context budget: ~20K tokens total
  |
  +-->  Level 1: Wave Agent (Task tool, separate context)
  |      |
  |      |  Holds: UC list for this wave, UC results (~100-200 words each)
  |      |  Context budget: ~30-50K tokens per wave
  |      |
  |      +-->  Level 2: Skill Agent (Task tool, separate context)
  |      |      /nacl:tl-dev-be, /nacl:tl-dev-fe, /nacl:tl-review, /nacl:tl-sync, /nacl:tl-qa, etc.
  |      |      Each gets a CLEAN context window (~100-200K tokens)
  |      |
  |      +-->  Level 2: Skill Agent ...
  |      +-->  Level 2: Skill Agent ...
  |
  +-->  Level 1: Wave Agent (next wave)
  ...
```

### Why Three Levels?

| Level | Agent | Context contains | Estimated tokens |
|-------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| L0 | nacl-tl-full | Wave summaries, final report | ~20K |
| L1 | Wave agent | UC results within one wave | ~30-50K per wave |
| L2 | Dev/Review/QA | One task, full focus | ~50-150K per task |

A project with 10 UCs x 8 phases = 80 L2 agents. Each L2 agent starts fresh. L1 agents accumulate results for 3-5 UCs. L0 sees only wave-level summaries.

---

## Neo4j Tools

| Tool | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `mcp__neo4j__read-cypher` | Read waves, tasks, phase status, progress |
| `mcp__neo4j__write-cypher` | Update Task.status and Task.phase_* properties |

Connection: read from config.yaml graph section (see ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/nacl-core/SKILL.md → Graph Config Resolution). MCP tools handle the connection automatically.

---

## Parameters

```
/nacl:tl-full                     # Full autonomous lifecycle
/nacl:tl-full --wave N            # Execute only wave N
/nacl:tl-full --task UC###        # Full lifecycle for one UC only
/nacl:tl-full --feature FR-NNN    # Execute only the wave created for feature request FR-NNN
/nacl:tl-full --yes               # Skip START GATE confirmation, begin execution immediately

# Removed in W9-ci-clean-checkout: the SKIP-PLAN full-lifecycle flag.
#   Planning is no longer skippable via flag. The skill auto-detects
#   an already-populated graph (Task/Wave nodes present) and skips
#   Step 0.2 silently in that case. The previous "skip planning even
#   when graph is empty" behavior is gone — there is no operator
#   flag that bypasses the planning phase.

# Removed in W3-blocking-qa: the bulk-QA-skip full-lifecycle flag.
#   QA bypass at the full-lifecycle layer is no longer an operator flag.
#   Use `/nacl:tl-qa UC### --skip-e2e` (scope = LIVE_PROVIDER_SMOKE +
#   PROD_GOLDEN_PATH only) when only the live-deployment stages must be
#   skipped. Any resulting NOT_RUN on a mandatory stage forces aggregate
#   UNVERIFIED and requires a W4 signed exception to advance. Bulk-bypass
#   needs route through W4 emergency mode.
```

---

## Phase 0: Initialization (L0 -- this agent)

### Step 0.1: Check Graph State

Probe Neo4j for Task and Wave nodes:

```cypher
// Probe: do Task/Wave nodes exist?
MATCH (n)
WHERE n:Task OR n:Wave
RETURN labels(n)[0] AS label, count(n) AS count
```

| Probe result | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| Task count > 0, Wave count > 0 | Graph is populated -- proceed |
| Task count = 0 or Wave count = 0 | No plan in graph. Run `/nacl:tl-plan` (Step 0.2) |
| Connection error / MCP tool failure | STOP. Report Neo4j unavailable. Suggest checking config.yaml → graph.neo4j_bolt_port (default: 3587) and Docker status |

Also check for a planning lock:

```
IF .tl/.planning.lock EXISTS:
  -> WARN: "A planning session is active. Wait for it to finish
    before starting development."
  -> Do NOT proceed until lock is removed.
```

### Step 0.2: Run Planning

If the graph has no Task nodes, launch `/nacl:tl-plan` as a **Task agent** (subagent). If Task/Wave nodes already exist, skip this step silently — the previous SKIP-PLAN flag was removed in W9-ci-clean-checkout because graph-state detection makes it unnecessary:

```
Launch Task agent: /nacl:tl-plan
  (or: /nacl:tl-plan scope:uc:<ids> if --feature flag maps to specific UCs)
Wait for completion.
```

After the Task agent completes, verify:
- Task/Wave nodes exist in Neo4j (re-run probe query)
- `.tl/master-plan.md` exists
- `.tl/status.json` is valid JSON
- `.tl/tasks/` has directories for all planned tasks

Do NOT run nacl-tl-plan inline -- it generates dozens of task files and will fill L0's context.

### Step 0.3: Load Wave Structure from Graph

Read the wave and task structure from Neo4j:

```cypher
// tl_progress_by_wave -- wave structure with progress
MATCH (t:Task)-[:IN_WAVE]->(w:Wave)
RETURN w.number AS wave,
       count(t) AS total,
       count(CASE WHEN t.status = 'done' THEN 1 END) AS done,
       count(CASE WHEN t.status = 'in_progress' THEN 1 END) AS in_progress,
       count(CASE WHEN t.status IN ['todo', 'pending'] THEN 1 END) AS pending,
       CASE WHEN count(t) > 0
         THEN round(100.0 * count(CASE WHEN t.status = 'done' THEN 1 END) / count(t))
         ELSE 0 END AS progress_pct
ORDER BY w.number
```

```cypher
// All tasks with wave, type, status, and phases
MATCH (t:Task)-[:IN_WAVE]->(w:Wave)
OPTIONAL MATCH (t)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(dep:Task)
RETURN t.id AS task_id, t.title AS title, t.type AS type,
       t.status AS status, t.priority AS priority,
       w.number AS wave,
       t.phase_be AS phase_be, t.phase_fe AS phase_fe,
       t.phase_sync AS phase_sync,
       t.phase_review_be AS phase_review_be,
       t.phase_review_fe AS phase_review_fe,
       t.phase_qa AS phase_qa,
       collect(dep.id) AS depends_on
ORDER BY w.number, t.id
```

This replaces reading `.tl/master-plan.md` for wave definitions.

### Step 0.4: START GATE -- Plan Approval

If `--yes` flag is set -> **skip this step entirely**, proceed directly to Step 0.5.

Otherwise, display:

```
===============================================================
                PLAN READY -- APPROVAL REQUIRED
              (source: Neo4j graph)
===============================================================

Project: [Name from master-plan.md]

  TECH Tasks:  M tasks (Wave 0)
  UC Tasks:    N tasks (BE + FE pairs)
  API Contracts: N
  Execution Waves: K

  Wave 0 (Infrastructure): TECH-001, TECH-002, ...
  Wave 1: UC001, UC002, UC003
  Wave 2: UC004, UC005
  ...

  Estimated work: (N x 8 phases) + (M x 2 phases) = X total phases

  Mode: AUTONOMOUS
  -- Auto-retry failures (max 3 per phase)
  -- Skip task after 3 consecutive failures
  -- No intermediate confirmations
  -- Phase status written to Neo4j after each step
  -- Final report when complete

Approve and start autonomous execution? [yes/no]
===============================================================
```

**Do NOT proceed until the user explicitly confirms.**

> Tip: use `--yes` to skip this gate and start immediately.

### Step 0.5: YouGile Integration (if configured)

If `config.yaml -> yougile` is configured:

#### Configuration Resolution

| Data | Source priority |
|------|---------------|
| YouGile columns | config.yaml -> yougile.columns.in_work / dev_done / reopened |
| Module test commands | config.yaml -> modules.[name].test_cmd (fallback: `npm test`) |
| Module build commands | config.yaml -> modules.[name].build_cmd (fallback: `npm run build`) |

If config.yaml missing -> skip YouGile moves, use default build/test commands.

**On start (after approval):**
- For each task being executed, move to InWork column:
  ```
  update_task(taskId, columnId: config.yougile.columns.in_work)
  ```

**On task completion (each UC/TECH):**
- Move to DevDone column:
  ```
  update_task(taskId, columnId: config.yougile.columns.dev_done)
  ```
- Post brief summary to task chat

**On task failure (after 3 retries):**
- Move to Reopened column with failure details

If YouGile NOT configured -> skip all column movements, just report locally.

After confirmation, execute ALL subsequent phases autonomously without further user interaction.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure -- Wave 0 (L0 delegates to L1)

Launch a **single Wave Agent** (Task tool) for Wave 0.

### L0 -> L1 Prompt for Wave 0

```
You are a Wave Executor for TeamLead workflow.

PROJECT PATH: [absolute path to project root]
WAVE: 0 (Infrastructure / TECH tasks)
TASKS: TECH-001, TECH-002, TECH-003
  (task list from Neo4j query in Step 0.3)
MODE: autonomous (no user confirmations)
SKIP_QA: [true/false]

GRAPH UPDATE PROTOCOL:
After each task phase completes, update Neo4j:
  mcp__neo4j__write-cypher:
    MATCH (t:Task {id: $taskId})
    SET t.status = $newStatus, t.updated = datetime()

Your job:
1. For each TECH task in order:
   a. Read .tl/tasks/TECH-###/task.md to understand the task
   b. Launch Task agent: execute /nacl:tl-dev TECH-### (development)
   c. **Read /nacl:tl-dev's six-status result BEFORE advancing.** Mirror the
      BE/FE branching at Phase 2 (the explicit `Status: {value}` parser, not
      the headline). Branch:
        Status: PASS                  → set t.phase_dev = 'done',
                                        t.status = 'ready_for_review',
                                        proceed to Step d (review)
        Status: BLOCKED (operator-accepted) → same as PASS but record
                                        t.blocked_accept_reason
        Status: BLOCKED (no acceptance) → halt task; set t.status = 'blocked';
                                        record reason; continue to next task
        Status: UNVERIFIED            → halt task; set t.status =
                                        'verified-pending'; record reason;
                                        continue to next task. Do NOT proceed
                                        to /nacl:tl-review.
        Status: NO_INFRA              → halt task; set t.status =
                                        'verified-pending';
                                        t.verification_skip_reason = 'NO_INFRA';
                                        continue to next task.
        Status: RUNNER_BROKEN         → halt task; set t.status = 'failed';
                                        record reason; continue to next task.
        Status: REGRESSION            → halt task; set t.status = 'failed';
                                        record reason; continue to next task.
        No parseable Status: line     → halt task; set t.status = 'failed';
                                        reason 'dev report unparseable'; continue.
   d. Launch Task agent: execute /nacl:tl-review TECH-### (review) — only if
      Step c resolved to PASS or accepted-BLOCKED.
   e. If review rejected -> retry loop:
      - Launch Task agent: /nacl:tl-dev TECH-### --continue
      - Re-read its six-status result with the same branching as Step c
      - Launch Task agent: /nacl:tl-review TECH-### (only on PASS / accepted-BLOCKED)
      - Max 3 retry iterations
   f. If still rejected after 3 -> mark as FAILED:
      MATCH (t:Task {id: $taskId}) SET t.status = 'failed', t.updated = datetime()
      Continue to next task
   g. If approved -> update graph (per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/nacl-core/SKILL.md` § Task.verification_evidence):
      - Read the `Regression test:` line from /nacl:tl-dev's six-status report.
        Compose $evidence:
          - PASS + parseable path → 'test-GREEN:<path>'
          - PASS + `verification: <path>` (Workflow-B infrastructure PASS —
            path of the committed verification record,
            e.g. `.tl/tasks/TECH-013/verification.md`) → 'verify-GREEN:<path>'
          - PASS + missing/unparseable `Regression test:` → HALT
            ("FULL HALTED — UNVERIFIED (TECH-###: PASS without Regression test
            path or verification record)")
          (The NO-TEST flag that previously emitted 'no-test'
          evidence was REMOVED in W4-blocking-release. The literal
          token is scrubbed from this skill's prose. Bulk-bypass
          routes through emergency mode — see
          ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/nacl-tl-core/references/emergency-mode.md.)
        Do NOT skip the SET on $evidence.
      MATCH (t:Task {id: $taskId})
      SET t.status = 'done',
          t.verification_evidence = $evidence,
          t.updated = datetime()

2. After all TECH tasks: Launch Task agent: /nacl:tl-stubs (full scan baseline)

3. Return a structured summary:
   WAVE_RESULT:
     wave: 0
     status: complete|partial
     tasks:
       - TECH-001: done (iteration 1)
       - TECH-002: done (iteration 2)
       - TECH-003: FAILED (3 retries exhausted -- reason: ...)
     stubs: { critical: 0, warning: 2, info: 5 }
     problems: [list of unresolved issues]
```

### L0 receives Wave 0 result

Parse the wave summary. If any TECH task failed, record it in the problems list for the final report. Continue to Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2: UC Development -- Waves 1..N (L0 delegates to L1)

For each wave (sequentially), launch a **Wave Agent** via Task tool.

### L0 -> L1 Prompt for UC Wave

```
You are a Wave Executor for TeamLead workflow.

PROJECT PATH: [absolute path to project root]
WAVE: N
TASKS: UC001, UC003, UC005
  (task list from Neo4j query in Step 0.3)
MODE: autonomous (no user confirmations)
SKIP_QA: [true/false]

GRAPH UPDATE PROTOCOL:
After each phase completes for a UC, update Neo4j:
  mcp__neo4j__write-cypher:
    MATCH (t:Task {id: $taskId})
    SET t.phase_<phase> = $newStatus,
        t.status = $overallStatus,
        t.updated = datetime()

Phase property names: phase_be, phase_review_be, phase_fe, phase_review_fe,
                      phase_sync, phase_qa
Status values: pending, in_progress, ready_for_review, approved, done, failed

CRITICAL: Your job is NOT done until EVERY UC reaches STEP 8 (Documentation).
Development (Steps 1 + 3) is just the beginning. You MUST continue through review,
sync, stubs, QA, and docs. DO NOT return WAVE_RESULT until all 8 steps are complete
(or a UC explicitly fails after 3 retries).

Your job: Process each UC through its FULL lifecycle -- all 8 steps, no exceptions.

For each UC (sequentially):

  STEP 1 -- Backend Development
    Update graph: SET t.phase_be = 'in_progress', t.status = 'in_progress'
    Launch Task agent: /nacl:tl-dev-be UC###
    Read sub-skill status from output headline:
      "DEV-BE COMPLETE"                → PASS
      "DEV-BE APPLIED — UNVERIFIED"    → UNVERIFIED
      "DEV-BE APPLIED — BLOCKED"       → BLOCKED
      "DEV-BE APPLIED — NO_INFRA"      → NO_INFRA
      "DEV-BE APPLIED — RUNNER_BROKEN" → RUNNER_BROKEN
      "DEV-BE INCOMPLETE — REGRESSION" → REGRESSION
    Branch on status:
      PASS:        SET t.phase_be = 'ready_for_review'
      UNVERIFIED:  SET t.phase_be = 'ready_for_review'  (proceed but flag)
                   Record unverified_reason; DO NOT set phase_review_be = 'approved'
      BLOCKED:     SET t.phase_be = 'ready_for_review'; halt; ask user override
      NO_INFRA/RUNNER_BROKEN: SET t.phase_be = 'failed'; HALT; escalate
      REGRESSION:  SET t.phase_be = 'failed'; HALT; file bug
    Expected: creates result-be.md
    DO NOT skip to STEP 3 without completing STEP 2 first.

  STEP 2 -- Backend Review  <- MANDATORY, never skip
    Update graph: SET t.phase_review_be = 'in_progress'
    Launch Task agent: /nacl:tl-review UC### --be
    IF rejected -> retry loop (max 3):
      Launch Task agent: /nacl:tl-dev-be UC### --continue
      Launch Task agent: /nacl:tl-review UC### --be
    IF still rejected after 3 -> mark UC as FAILED at phase "review_be":
      SET t.phase_review_be = 'failed', t.status = 'failed'
      Skip to next UC
    IF approved AND BE dev status was PASS:
      SET t.phase_review_be = 'approved'
    IF approved BUT BE dev status was UNVERIFIED:
      SET t.phase_review_be = 'ready_for_review'  (NOT 'approved' — UNVERIFIED dev
                                                     cannot advance to approved)
    Only proceed to STEP 3 when phase_review_be = 'approved' (PASS path only)
    For UNVERIFIED path: record status; continue to STEP 3 but mark UC unverified

  STEP 3 -- Frontend Development
    Prerequisite: phase_review_be = approved (or UNVERIFIED override)
    Update graph: SET t.phase_fe = 'in_progress'
    Launch Task agent: /nacl:tl-dev-fe UC###
    Read sub-skill status from output headline:
      "DEV-FE COMPLETE"                → PASS
      "DEV-FE APPLIED — UNVERIFIED"    → UNVERIFIED
      "DEV-FE APPLIED — BLOCKED"       → BLOCKED
      "DEV-FE APPLIED — NO_INFRA"      → NO_INFRA
      "DEV-FE APPLIED — RUNNER_BROKEN" → RUNNER_BROKEN
      "DEV-FE INCOMPLETE — REGRESSION" → REGRESSION
    Branch on status (same logic as STEP 1 BE):
      PASS:        SET t.phase_fe = 'ready_for_review'
      UNVERIFIED:  SET t.phase_fe = 'ready_for_review'; record unverified_reason
      BLOCKED:     SET t.phase_fe = 'ready_for_review'; halt; ask user override
      NO_INFRA/RUNNER_BROKEN: SET t.phase_fe = 'failed'; HALT; escalate

    Update graph: SET t.phase_review_fe = 'in_progress'
    Launch Task agent: /nacl:tl-review UC### --fe
    IF rejected -> retry loop (max 3):
      Launch Task agent: /nacl:tl-dev-fe UC### --continue
      Launch Task agent: /nacl:tl-review UC### --fe

      Skip to next UC
    IF approved AND FE dev status was PASS:

    Only proceed to STEP 5 when phase_review_fe = 'approved' (PASS path only)
    For UNVERIFIED path: record; continue but UC remains unverified

  STEP 8 -- Documentation  <- MANDATORY, final step
    Launch Task agent: /nacl:tl-docs UC###
    Aggregate UC status from all phase statuses, and write
    `Task.verification_evidence` per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/nacl-core/SKILL.md` taxonomy.

    Collect regression-test paths from the BE/FE dev sub-skill reports
    (the canonical `Regression test:` line emitted by /nacl:tl-dev-be and
    /nacl:tl-dev-fe). Compose the evidence value:
      - If both BE and FE PASS with `Regression test:` paths:
          $evidence = 'test-GREEN:<be_path>;<fe_path>'
        (semicolon-joined; preserves both sides for the release Evidence column)
      - If only one side PASS with path, the other absent/n-a:
          $evidence = 'test-GREEN:<path>'
      - If any phase UNVERIFIED:
          $evidence = 'test-UNVERIFIED'
      - If any phase BLOCKED (with override) and no UNVERIFIED:
          $evidence = 'test-UNVERIFIED'  (no RED→GREEN proof on this UC)
      (The NO-TEST flag — previously the only path to 'no-test'
      evidence — was REMOVED in W4-blocking-release. The 'no-test'
      evidence string is no longer producible by this skill. The
      bulk-bypass use case routes through emergency mode; see
      ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/nacl-tl-core/references/emergency-mode.md.)

    Cypher:
      MATCH (t:Task {id: $taskId})
      SET t.status = $aggregatedStatus,        // 'done' | 'verified-pending' | 'blocked'
          t.verification_evidence = $evidence, // see table above
          t.updated = datetime()

    Branching for $aggregatedStatus:
      - If ALL phases were PASS: $aggregatedStatus = 'done'
      - If ANY phase was UNVERIFIED: $aggregatedStatus = 'verified-pending'
      - If ANY phase was BLOCKED (with override): $aggregatedStatus = 'blocked'

    Write aggregated status to .tl/status.json for this UC
    UC is considered DONE only when ALL phases PASS

    HALT contract: If $aggregatedStatus = 'done' but no `Regression test:`
    path was parsed from either BE or FE report, HALT with:
      "WAVE HALTED — UNVERIFIED (UC###: aggregated PASS without parseable
       Regression test path; refusing to write t.status='done' without evidence)"
    Do NOT silently write evidence = '' or skip the SET — that is the bug
    that produced the v0.13.0 "Verification gap" reports. (The NO-TEST
    flag that previously offered an escape hatch from this HALT was
    REMOVED in W4-blocking-release; emergency mode is the only bulk-
    bypass path now.)

REMINDER: Do NOT return WAVE_RESULT after Step 1 or Step 3. Continue executing
Steps 2 through 8 before considering any UC complete.

After ALL UCs have reached Step 8 (or explicitly failed), return:

WAVE_RESULT:
  wave: N
  status: complete|partial
  tasks:
    - UC001: done [PASS] (all 8 phases complete, graph: done)
    - UC003: done [UNVERIFIED] (all phases complete, no test exercises change,
             graph: verified-pending)
    - UC005: FAILED [REGRESSION] at phase "qa" (3 retries -- regression detected)
  status_summary:
    pass: 1
    unverified: 1
    blocked: 0
    regression: 1
  headline: FULL APPLIED — UNVERIFIED
  problems: [list of unresolved issues with details]

Headline selection rules:
  - ALL tasks PASS → FULL COMPLETE
  - ANY task REGRESSION → FULL INCOMPLETE — REGRESSION
  - ANY task UNVERIFIED (and no REGRESSION) → FULL APPLIED — UNVERIFIED
  - ANY task BLOCKED (and no REGRESSION/UNVERIFIED) → FULL APPLIED — BLOCKED
  - ANY task NO_INFRA / RUNNER_BROKEN → FULL HALTED — {suffix}
```

### L0 receives each Wave result

After each wave completes:
1. Parse the wave summary
2. Record results (done / failed tasks)
3. Verify graph state -- run `tl_progress_by_wave` to confirm updates persisted:
   ```cypher
   MATCH (t:Task)-[:IN_WAVE]->(w:Wave {number: $waveNum})
   RETURN t.id AS task_id, t.status AS status,
          t.phase_be, t.phase_fe, t.phase_sync,
          t.phase_review_be, t.phase_review_fe, t.phase_qa
   ```
4. If all tasks in wave done -> proceed to next wave
5. If some tasks failed -> record in problems list, proceed to next wave
6. Launch next wave agent

---

## Phase 3: Finalization (L0 -- this agent)

After all waves complete:

### Step 3.0: Phase Completion Validation <- MANDATORY before END GATE

**Before declaring execution complete**, query Neo4j to verify every UC task:

```cypher
// Verify all tasks have terminal status
MATCH (t:Task)-[:IN_WAVE]->(w:Wave)
WHERE t.type = 'uc' AND t.status <> 'done' AND t.status <> 'failed'
RETURN t.id AS task_id, t.title AS title, t.status AS status,
       w.number AS wave,
       t.phase_be, t.phase_fe, t.phase_sync,
       t.phase_review_be, t.phase_review_fe, t.phase_qa
ORDER BY w.number, t.id
```

For each UC that is NOT in terminal state (`done`, `verified-pending`, `blocked`, or `failed`):

```
IF any phase is pending/in_progress (and task not explicitly FAILED):
  -> UC is NOT complete -- do NOT proceed to END GATE
  -> Identify which phase is incomplete
  -> Re-launch Wave Agent for that UC starting from the incomplete phase:
    "Continue UC### from phase [X]. All previous phases are done."
  -> Wait for completion
  -> Re-query graph to validate

Status-aware terminal states:
  done             -- all phases PASS
  verified-pending -- any phase UNVERIFIED (fix applied, no test covers it)
  blocked          -- any phase BLOCKED (pre-existing failures, user override)
  failed           -- phase failed after 3 retries, or REGRESSION

A phase reaches 'approved' ONLY when sub-skill status is PASS.
For UNVERIFIED sub-skill output, phase remains 'ready_for_review'.

ONLY when all UCs are in a terminal state -> proceed to Step 3.1
```

This validation prevents false "EXECUTION COMPLETE" reports when dev is done but review/sync/QA are still pending. It also prevents 'approved' from being written when the sub-skill returned UNVERIFIED.

### Step 3.1: Final Stub Scan

Launch Task agent: `/nacl:tl-stubs --final`. Record result from agent output.
Do NOT run inline -- stub scanning reads all source files and will bloat L0 context.

### Step 3.2: END GATE -- Final Report

Query final progress from Neo4j:

```cypher
// Final progress summary
MATCH (t:Task)-[:IN_WAVE]->(w:Wave)
RETURN w.number AS wave, w.name AS wave_name,
       t.id AS task_id, t.title AS title, t.type AS type,
       t.status AS status
ORDER BY w.number, t.id
```

## Resumption Logic

On start, if Task nodes exist in Neo4j with non-pending status, resume instead of starting fresh.

### State Detection from Graph

```cypher
// Find the first incomplete phase for each UC task
MATCH (t:Task)-[:IN_WAVE]->(w:Wave)
WHERE t.status <> 'done' AND t.status <> 'failed'
RETURN t.id AS task_id, t.title AS title, t.type AS type,
       w.number AS wave,
       t.status AS status,
       t.phase_be, t.phase_fe, t.phase_sync,
       t.phase_review_be, t.phase_review_fe, t.phase_qa
ORDER BY w.number, t.id
```

Phase-based resume logic:

```
TECH tasks:
  pending              -> start from /nacl:tl-dev
  in_progress          -> /nacl:tl-dev --continue
  ready_for_review     -> /nacl:tl-review
  approved/done        -> skip

UC tasks (check phase properties in order):
  phase_be = pending/in_progress             -> start from BE dev
  phase_be = ready_for_review                -> BE review
  phase_review_be = rejected                 -> BE dev --continue
  phase_review_be = approved, phase_fe = pending -> FE dev
  phase_fe = ready_for_review                -> FE review
  phase_review_fe = rejected                 -> FE dev --continue
  phase_review_fe = approved, phase_sync = pending -> sync
  phase_sync = failed                        -> fix + re-sync
  phase_sync = done, stubs not scanned       -> stubs
  phase_qa = pending                         -> QA
  phase_qa = failed                          -> fix + re-QA
  phase_qa = done                            -> docs (if not done)
  all phases done                            -> skip
```

### Resume Presentation

```
===============================================================
            RESUMING -- PROJECT STATE DETECTED
            (source: Neo4j graph)
===============================================================

Project: [Name]
Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

Completed:
  [done]        Wave 0: 3/3 TECH tasks done
  [done]        Wave 1: 2/2 UCs done
  [in_progress] Wave 2: 1/3 UCs done, 1 in progress, 1 pending

Resume point:
  Wave 2, UC004 -- resume from FE development (BE approved)

Continue autonomous execution from this point? [yes/no]
===============================================================
```

This counts as the START GATE. After user confirms, execute autonomously.

If `--yes` flag is set -> skip this confirmation and resume immediately.

## Graph Update Protocol

Every phase transition MUST be written to Neo4j. This is the **key difference** from nacl-tl-full.

### Update Query Template

```cypher
// Generic phase update -- used after every step completes
MATCH (t:Task {id: $taskId})
SET t.<phase_property> = $newStatus,
    t.status = $overallStatus,
    t.updated = datetime()
```

### Phase Transition Table

| Step | Phase property | On start | On success | On failure (after 3 retries) |
|------|---------------|----------|------------|------------------------------|
| BE dev | `phase_be` | `in_progress` | `ready_for_review` | `failed` |
| BE review | `phase_review_be` | `in_progress` | `approved` | `failed` |
| FE dev | `phase_fe` | `in_progress` | `ready_for_review` | `failed` |
| FE review | `phase_review_fe` | `in_progress` | `approved` | `failed` |
| Sync | `phase_sync` | `in_progress` | `done` | `failed` |
| QA | `phase_qa` | `in_progress` | `done` | `failed` |
| Docs | -- | -- | `status = 'done'` | -- |
| TECH | `status` | `in_progress` | `done` | `failed` |

### Overall Task Status

The `status` property on the Task node reflects the overall state:

| Condition | Task.status |
|-----------|-------------|
| No phase started | `pending` |
| Any phase in progress | `in_progress` |
| All phases complete | `done` |
| Any phase failed (after 3 retries) | `failed` |

### Dual-Write: Graph + JSON

After each graph update, also update `.tl/status.json` to keep it in sync. Dev skills and other non-graph-aware tools read from `status.json`, so it must stay current.

```
1. Write to Neo4j (primary)
2. IF Neo4j write succeeds -> update .tl/status.json (secondary) -- same phase data
3. IF Neo4j write fails   -> DO NOT advance the phase; DO NOT update status.json;
                             halt with error: "PHASE_ADVANCE_HALTED: Neo4j write failed"
```

**Rule:** both stores must be updated atomically, or neither advances. A partial write (JSON updated, graph not updated) creates JSON-vs-graph divergence that is difficult to recover from. Fail loud; do not silently continue.

### Outage Recovery

If Neo4j was unavailable during any part of the execution (e.g., write attempts failed, connection refused, or partial phase updates were logged), the operator **must** run `/nacl:tl-diagnose` before resuming orchestration. This reconciles JSON state against the graph and surfaces any divergence.

**Procedure:**

```
1. Confirm Neo4j is back online (test connection)
2. Run: /nacl:tl-diagnose
3. Review the DIAGNOSTIC-REPORT.md — look for graph-JSON mismatches
4. If mismatches found: graph is the source of truth; overwrite status.json with graph data
5. Only after a clean diagnose (or explicit mismatch resolution) resume with /nacl:tl-full
```

Skipping this step and resuming directly risks the orchestrator reading stale JSON and advancing phases that the graph still shows as incomplete or failed.

### Remote mode (multi-user shared graph)

Everything above is **local mode** (`config.yaml` `graph.mode` absent or `local`) — unchanged.
When `graph.mode: remote` (one shared graph on a VPS, several developers), the dual-write fence
changes per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/nacl-tl-core/references/remote-mode-coordination.md`:

- **Graph is the sole source of truth.** A successful Neo4j write is sufficient to advance; the
  `.tl/status.json` write becomes a best-effort LOCAL cache (it is per-clone and diverges across
  developers — never authoritative, never a coordination signal).
- **Resume reads the graph only** (not `status.json`); there is no stale-cache fallback — if the
  graph is unreachable, HALT.
- **Claim before working.** Before starting a Task, acquire its claim-lock with
  `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/nacl-core/scripts/claim-task.mjs claim --task <id> --dev "$NACL_DEVELOPER_ID"` (run the
  emitted Cypher via `mcp__neo4j__write-cypher`); if the returned `owner` ≠ you, the task is held —
  pick another. Resolve the id with
  `NACL_DEVELOPER_ID="$(node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/nacl-core/scripts/resolve-developer-id.mjs --project-root .)"`
  (precedence: `$NACL_DEVELOPER_ID` env → `config.yaml developer.id` → auto
  `<git email|user>/<machine-key>` — one human on two machines gets two distinct ids with nothing to
  configure; see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/nacl-tl-core/references/remote-mode-coordination.md` §3).
- **Stamp provenance** (`updated_by`/`updated_at`) on phase-advance writes.

---

## Retry Policy

All retry loops (at L1 and L2 levels) follow:

```
MAX_RETRIES = 3

for iteration in 1..3:
  1. Fix: /nacl:tl-dev-be UC### --continue  (or appropriate fix command)
  2. Verify: /nacl:tl-review UC### --be     (or appropriate check)
  3. If passed -> break, continue lifecycle
  4. If failed -> log, continue loop

After 3 failures:
  -> Update graph: SET t.phase_<X> = 'failed', t.status = 'failed'
  -> Record failure details (phase, reason, retry log)
  -> Skip to next task (do NOT stop the entire orchestration)
  -> Include in final report problems list
```

**Critical**: failures do NOT stop the orchestration. Other tasks continue. Only the failing task is skipped.

---

## Parallel Execution Within Waves

Wave agents process UCs sequentially by default. However, for UCs within the same wave that have NO mutual dependencies, L1 can batch L2 calls:

```
Wave 2 has: UC001, UC003, UC004
  UC001 and UC003: independent -> can parallel
  UC004 depends on UC001 -> sequential after UC001

Execution order:
  Batch 1: /nacl:tl-dev-be UC001 + /nacl:tl-dev-be UC003  (parallel Task calls)
  Batch 2: /nacl:tl-review UC001 --be + /nacl:tl-review UC003 --be  (parallel)
  ... (continue batched phases)
  Then: UC004 (sequential, after UC001 completes)
```

To check independence, query:

```cypher
// Check if two tasks are independent (no DEPENDS_ON path between them)
MATCH (a:Task {id: $taskA}), (b:Task {id: $taskB})
OPTIONAL MATCH path = (a)-[:DEPENDS_ON*1..5]-(b)
RETURN path IS NULL AS independent
```

---

## Scope Variants

### --wave N

Execute only wave N. Skip all other waves. Load tasks for that wave from graph:

```cypher
MATCH (t:Task)-[:IN_WAVE]->(w:Wave {number: $waveNum})
OPTIONAL MATCH (t)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(dep:Task)
RETURN t.id AS task_id, t.title AS title, t.type AS type,
       t.status AS status, collect(dep.id) AS depends_on
ORDER BY t.id
```

### --task UC###

Full lifecycle for one UC. Skip planning. Verify dependencies met via graph. Process all 8 phases.

```cypher
// Verify all dependencies are done
MATCH (t:Task {id: $taskId})-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(dep:Task)
WHERE dep.status <> 'done'
RETURN dep.id AS blocking_task, dep.status AS blocking_status
```

If any dependency is not done -> report blockers and STOP.

Launch a single Wave Agent (Task tool) with TASKS: [UC###] -- same L0->L1 prompt as a regular wave.
Do NOT run the 8 phases inline at L0.

### --feature FR-NNN

Execute only the wave created for feature request FR-NNN. Look up the wave from graph:

```cypher
// Find wave for a feature request
MATCH (t:Task)-[:IN_WAVE]->(w:Wave)
WHERE t.title CONTAINS $featureId OR w.name CONTAINS $featureId
RETURN DISTINCT w.number AS wave
```

Equivalent to `--wave N` where N is the wave assigned to this FR.

### SKIP-PLAN flag (REMOVED in W9-ci-clean-checkout)

The SKIP-PLAN flag (was: "skip Phase 0 planning; assume `.tl/`
already populated and graph already has Task/Wave nodes") was
REMOVED in W9-ci-clean-checkout. Phase 0 already detects an
already-populated graph (Task/Wave count > 0 in the probe query)
and skips the `/nacl:tl-plan` Task-agent launch in that case. The
flag was redundant; its only remaining use case was bypassing
planning when the graph WAS empty, which is exactly the case the
planning phase exists to handle. Removing the flag eliminates a
class of "delivered without a plan" episodes.

There is no override that resurrects the flag. Operators wanting
to force a re-plan should clear Task/Wave nodes (or invoke
`/nacl:tl-plan` directly with explicit scope) before re-running
`/nacl:tl-full`.

### Bulk-QA-skip flag (REMOVED in W3-blocking-qa)

The bulk-QA-skip flag (previously documented at this position) was
removed from this skill in W3-blocking-qa. QA bypass at the
full-lifecycle layer is no longer an operator flag — the
SKIP-as-PASS failure mode it produced (project-beta UC-200/UC-300
provider-skip episode) is what W3 closed.

Alternatives:

- **Single-stage skip (live-deployment stages only):** invoke
  `/nacl:tl-qa UC### --skip-e2e`. Its scope is exactly
  `LIVE_PROVIDER_SMOKE` and `PROD_GOLDEN_PATH`. The four pre-deployment
  stages (`COMPONENT_QA`, `LOCAL_RUNTIME_QA`, `WIRE_CONTRACT_QA`,
  `PROVIDER_FIXTURE_QA`) still run. If either skipped stage is
  mandatory for the UC (per the matrix or project override), aggregate
  is forced to `UNVERIFIED` — a W4 signed exception with
  `affected_gates` naming the specific stage(s) is required to advance.
- **Bulk-bypass needs:** route through W4 emergency mode (loudly
  recorded; not a silent flag). See nacl-tl-release / nacl-tl-core for
  the emergency-mode invocation.

## What You Do at L0 (This Agent)

Your job as the top-level orchestrator is minimal but critical:

1. **Initialize**: check graph state, run /nacl:tl-plan if needed
2. **START GATE**: show plan (from graph), get user approval
3. **Delegate waves**: for each wave, launch ONE Task agent (L1) with full instructions including the Graph Update Protocol
4. **Collect results**: parse wave summaries, verify graph state, accumulate problems
5. **Finalize**: validate all phases via graph query, run final stubs, display END GATE report
6. **Handle edge cases**: if wave agent crashes, retry the wave once

### What You Do NOT Do

- Write code
- Create task files
- Review code
- Run tests
- Read source files
- Make intermediate confirmations
- Execute dev skills directly (always delegate via Task tool)

---

## Progress Queries (L0 uses between waves)

Between wave executions, L0 can check progress without reading files:

```cypher
// Quick progress check
MATCH (t:Task)
RETURN t.status AS status, count(t) AS count
ORDER BY
  CASE t.status
    WHEN 'done' THEN 1
    WHEN 'in_progress' THEN 2
    WHEN 'pending' THEN 3
    WHEN 'failed' THEN 4
    ELSE 5
  END
```

```cypher
// Active wave (lowest wave with incomplete tasks)
MATCH (t:Task)-[:IN_WAVE]->(w:Wave)
WHERE t.status <> 'done'
RETURN w.number AS active_wave, count(t) AS remaining_tasks
ORDER BY w.number
LIMIT 1
```

These are lightweight queries that keep L0's context clean.

## Error Handling

### Neo4j connection failure during execution

If a graph write fails mid-execution, halt phase advancement (the previous "continue with status.json only" path is removed — divergence between the graph and the local status file produces the same dishonest-reporting class addressed elsewhere in this release):

1. Log the error verbatim, including `taskId`, `phase`, and the Cypher statement.
2. Persist the in-flight phase result to `.tl/status.json` for forensic inspection only — do NOT advance the wave.
3. STOP wave execution. Do NOT proceed to the next phase or the next task.
4. At END GATE, report: `FULL HALTED — UNVERIFIED (graph write failed for Task <taskId> phase <phase>); resolve Neo4j connectivity and re-run /nacl:tl-full --task <taskId>.`
5. Do NOT mark any incomplete UC as `done` in `.tl/status.json` — without graph confirmation the run is unverified.

### Neo4j unavailable at startup

If the probe query in Step 0.1 fails:
1. STOP. Do not attempt to run without graph.
2. Report: `"Neo4j unavailable. Check config.yaml → graph.neo4j_bolt_port (default: 3587). Use /nacl:tl-full for non-graph execution."`
3. Suggest: check Neo4j is running, verify connection parameters in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/nacl-core/SKILL.md`.

### Wave agent crash

If a wave agent (L1) returns no result or an error:
1. Retry the wave ONCE with the same prompt
2. If retry also fails -> mark all remaining tasks in that wave as FAILED
3. Update graph: `SET t.status = 'failed'` for each
4. Continue to next wave

### Graph-JSON inconsistency

If graph state and `status.json` diverge:
- Graph is the **source of truth**
- Overwrite `status.json` with graph data
- Log: `"Resolved graph-JSON inconsistency for Task $taskId"`
