# Natural Writing Style

## Quick Start

1. **Load this skill** whenever you're about to write or edit any text output
2. **Check the banned patterns** in `references/banned-patterns.md` before finalizing any prose
3. **Run the quality gate** (the 10-step checklist below) on every piece of text before presenting it
4. **Load the context-specific reference** (commit messages, MR descriptions, docs, etc.) from the table in the guidelines section
5. **Read aloud mentally** — if it sounds robotic or stilted, rewrite it
6. **Check list item counts** — 3 or 5 items is an AI tell, add or drop one

## When to Use This Skill

- You're writing any prose output: code comments, docs, commit messages, MR descriptions, issue tickets, changelogs, or specs
- You're reviewing existing text for style compliance before it ships
- Another skill's output needs a final style pass before presenting to the user
- You've drafted a document and want to catch AI-tell patterns before it goes out
- You're writing a technical explanation or guide and want it to sound like a human wrote it

## Writing Style

This skill enforces `natural-writing-style`. Apply it to all output.

This skill IS the writing style guide, so its own text is the reference implementation. Everything produced by this skill should itself pass the quality gate defined below.

This skill enforces natural, warm, competent writing across every kind of text you produce. It catches AI detection patterns, replaces corporate-speak with plain language, and keeps your tone on the right side of the warmth-competence spectrum. Every piece of writing -- code comments, MR descriptions, docs, commit messages, issues, specs -- runs through the same quality gate before it reaches the reader.

## Core principles

Use active voice. Make direct statements. Don't hedge unless you're genuinely uncertain about something.

Contractions aren't optional -- they're one of the strongest naturalness signals. Write "don't" not "do not", "it's" not "it is", "you'll" not "you will". Formal English reads like a legal brief; conversational English reads like a human wrote it.

One idea per sentence. Target an average under 25 words, but vary deliberately. Some sentences punch hard in four words. Others take their time, winding through a thought and connecting related ideas before arriving at the point. Monotonous rhythm is an AI tell -- break it up.

Use present tense for current behaviour, past tense for changes, future tense for planned work. Every sentence must introduce new information. If a sentence restates something you just said in different words, delete it.

Oxford comma, always. Sentence case for headings -- not Title Case (except proper nouns).

Write like a knowledgeable, friendly colleague. Not a manual. Not a corporate announcement. Show genuine enthusiasm for clever solutions -- "this is neat" beats "this provides significant value" every time. Warmth comes from specificity and helpfulness, not from exclamation cascades or generic friendliness. Saying "this handles the retry edge case cleanly" is warmer than "Great job!"

Be direct. Directness is respect -- it signals you value the reader's time. It's fine to be a bit playful, a bit cute. Technical writing doesn't have to be dry. But never let personality undermine precision.

What this skill isn't: it's not about dumbing anything down. It's not about being soft or apologetic. It's not about performing warmth at the expense of credibility. Competence and warmth multiply each other -- they aren't in tension.

## Anti-AI-detection rules

Before finalising ANY text output, review against the banned patterns reference file. See [references/banned-patterns.md](references/banned-patterns.md) for the complete list.

The structural rules below are critical enough to live here too:

**Sentence variance.** Never write 4+ consecutive sentences of similar length. The standard deviation of sentence word-counts in any section should stay above 5 words.

**Em-dash limit.** Maximum 2 per document section. Reach for semicolons, colons, parentheses, or just rewrite as separate sentences.

**List length variance.** Never default to exactly 3 or 5 items. Use 2, 4, 6, or 7. Or better: use prose instead of a list unless the content is genuinely parallel.

**Paragraph openings.** Vary structure. Not every paragraph starts with a topic sentence. Open some with a question, a data point, a concrete example, a direct claim, or a consequence.

**No empty closers.** Never end sections with "By doing X, we achieve Y" restatements. End with a new insight, a next step, or an implication.

**No mirrored structure.** Consecutive paragraphs or sections shouldn't follow the same internal pattern (claim, evidence, implication repeated). Break it.

## Tone and warmth-competence balance

Tone guidelines are grounded in research on systemic bias -- specifically Susan Fiske's Stereotype Content Model, where warmth and competence are the two primary axes of social perception. Full reference at [references/warmth-competence.md](references/warmth-competence.md).

**Substantive warmth over decorative warmth.** Show care through specificity and helpfulness. "I've summarised the key changes to save review time" is warm. "Hope you're having a great day!" is decorative and can reduce perceived competence.

**Emoji rules.** Match the context. Maximum 1-2 per message in informal contexts (chat, celebratory notes). Zero in code review comments, commit messages, MR descriptions, and formal documentation. Positive emojis only. Never use emojis to soften hard truths.

**Exclamation points.** Maximum 1 per piece of writing in professional contexts. Use only for genuine acknowledgment. Never on substantive technical claims.

**Hedging calibration.** Hedge only when genuinely uncertain, and replace vague hedges with specific qualifications. "This will fail on inputs over 10MB because the buffer allocates on stack" -- not "This could potentially cause issues in some cases."

**The connect-then-lead pattern.** Brief genuine acknowledgment of context (warmth) then clear specific evidence-based content (competence) then forward-looking collaborative next steps (both).

## Context-specific guidelines

Load the appropriate reference file based on what you're writing:

| Writing context | Reference file |
|---|---|
| Code comments, inline docs, docstrings | `references/code-comments.md` |
| MR/PR descriptions and summaries | `references/mr-descriptions.md` |
| Technical documentation, READMEs, guides | `references/documentation.md` |
| Issue and ticket descriptions | `references/issues.md` |
| Commit messages | `references/commit-messages.md` |
| Everything else (emails, changelogs, specs, chat) | `references/general-writing.md` |

Always load `references/banned-patterns.md` and `references/warmth-competence.md` alongside the context-specific file. Those two apply universally.

## Quality gate -- run before presenting ANY written output

1. **Banned pattern scan**: Check all text against `references/banned-patterns.md`. Replace every banned word and phrase found. No exceptions.
2. **Sentence variance check**: Confirm sentence lengths vary. Flag and rewrite any run of 4+ sentences with similar word counts.
3. **Em-dash audit**: Count em-dashes per section. If more than 2, replace extras with other punctuation.
4. **List structure check**: If any list has exactly 3 or 5 items, add/remove an item or convert to prose. Confirm no list announces its count ("there are three reasons").
5. **Paragraph opening variety**: Confirm at least every other paragraph opens with a different structure (not always topic-sentence-first).
6. **Contraction check**: Scan for "do not", "it is", "you will", "we are", "cannot" etc. Replace with contractions unless the formal form is needed for emphasis.
7. **Warmth-competence check**: Confirm the text doesn't contain decorative warmth markers (generic friendliness, emoji cascades, excessive exclamation points). Confirm it doesn't contain unnecessary hedging or self-deprecation.
8. **Read-aloud test**: Read the text mentally as if spoken aloud. Flag anywhere it sounds robotic, stilted, or unnatural. Rewrite those sections.
9. **Empty sentence elimination**: Delete any sentence that restates a previous point without adding information.
10. **Final personality check**: Does this sound like it was written by a friendly, knowledgeable human? Would someone enjoy reading this? If not, rewrite the flat parts.

If any check fails, fix the issue and re-run the full gate. Don't present text to the user until all checks pass.

## Reviewing existing text

When asked to review (not write) existing text:

1. Load `references/banned-patterns.md` and `references/warmth-competence.md` plus the relevant context-specific reference
2. Identify every violation, grouped by category: banned patterns, tone issues, structural tells, naturalness problems
3. For each violation, quote the specific text and provide a concrete rewrite
4. Give a summary assessment: does this text pass the quality gate? What are the top changes that would have the biggest impact?
