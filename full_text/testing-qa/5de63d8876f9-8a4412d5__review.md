  Canonical Nexus review command. Persists the required current audit set and structured
  review completion state for the governed Nexus lifecycle. Use when the user says
  "review the change", "audit this build", "dual-review before ship", or when a `/build`
  result needs governed verdict before it can advance to `/qa` or `/ship`. (nexus)

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not proactively suggest Nexus commands AND do not
auto-invoke skills based on conversation context. Only run skills the user explicitly
types (e.g., /qa, /ship). If you would have auto-invoked a skill, instead briefly say:
"I think /skillname might help here — want me to run it?" and wait for confirmation.
The user opted out of proactive behavior.

If `SKILL_PREFIX` is `"true"`, the user has namespaced Nexus commands. When suggesting
or invoking other Nexus commands, use the `/nexus-` prefix (e.g., `/nexus-qa` instead
of `/qa`, `/nexus-ship` instead of `/ship`). Disk paths are unaffected — always use
`~/.claude/skills/nexus/[skill-name]/SKILL.md` for reading skill files.

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.claude/skills/nexus/nexus-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the release-based "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined). `/nexus-upgrade` now upgrades from published Nexus releases on the configured release channel, not from upstream repo head. If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell user "Running Nexus v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present, always include the standardized runtime summary before moving on to work, even when `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `yes`.

When summarizing setup or upgrade state, always keep `REPO_MODE` and `EXECUTION_MODE` separate:
- `REPO_MODE` is repo ownership only, for example `solo` or `collaborative`
- `EXECUTION_MODE` is runtime routing only, either `governed_ccb` or `local_provider`
- Never describe `solo` or `collaborative` as an execution mode
- If `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no`, say it is the current default derived from machine state, not a saved preference
- `EXECUTION_MODE_SOURCE` explains whether the active route came from a saved preference or a machine-state default
- `EXECUTION_PATH` is the current effective route, for example `codex-via-ccb`
- `CURRENT_SESSION_READY` tells you whether the chosen route is runnable right now in this host/session
- `REQUIRED_GOVERNED_PROVIDERS` is the governed provider set Nexus needs for the standard dual-audit path
- when `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb`, also surface `GOVERNED_READY`, `MOUNTED_PROVIDERS`, and `MISSING_PROVIDERS`
- `LOCAL_PROVIDER_CANDIDATE`, `LOCAL_PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY`, `LOCAL_PROVIDER_EXECUTION_PATH`, and `LOCAL_PROVIDER_READY` describe the current-host local fallback path

Whenever you summarize setup, upgrade, or first-run state, present runtime status in this order:
- Repo mode: `REPO_MODE`
- Execution mode: `EXECUTION_MODE` plus whether it is a saved preference or a machine-state default (`EXECUTION_MODE_SOURCE`)
- Execution path: `EXECUTION_PATH`
- Current session ready: `CURRENT_SESSION_READY`
- If `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb`: governed ready, mounted providers, missing providers
- If `EXECUTION_MODE=local_provider` because governed CCB is not ready, explicitly say whether that is because CCB is missing or because mounted providers are incomplete, and include the local fallback path
- Branch: `_BRANCH`
- Proactive: `PROACTIVE`

When `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb` and `CURRENT_SESSION_READY` is `no`, explicitly tell the user whether the gap is:
- CCB not installed (`CCB_AVAILABLE=no`), or
- CCB installed but required providers are not mounted (`MISSING_PROVIDERS` is non-empty)

If `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb` and `CURRENT_SESSION_READY` is `no` and `LOCAL_PROVIDER_READY` is `yes`, use AskUserQuestion before moving into lifecycle work:

> Nexus is currently configured for governed CCB, but this session cannot run that route.
> The local provider path is ready, so you can either switch this host to local_provider or keep the governed CCB preference and mount the missing providers.
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose A if you want to work now in this host. Choose B only if you intend to mount CCB providers before continuing.
> A) Switch this host to local_provider (human: ~0m / CC: ~0m) — Completeness: 8/10
> B) Keep governed_ccb and mount the missing CCB providers (human: ~2m / CC: ~0m) — Completeness: 9/10

If A:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set execution_mode local_provider
if [ -n "$_LOCAL_PROVIDER_CANDIDATE" ]; then
  ~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set primary_provider "$_LOCAL_PROVIDER_CANDIDATE"
fi
if [ -n "$_LOCAL_PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY" ]; then
  ~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set provider_topology "$_LOCAL_PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY"
fi
```
Then explain that future Nexus runs on this host will use `local_provider` until the user changes the saved preference.

If B: do not change Nexus config. Tell the user to mount the missing providers before running governed commands. If CCB is installed but providers are missing, say the standard start path is `tmux` with `ccb codex gemini claude`. If CCB is not installed, say they need to install or restore CCB first.

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present and `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no`, state the effective execution mode explicitly using `EXECUTION_MODE`, `EXECUTION_MODE_SOURCE`, and `CCB_AVAILABLE`. Use `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config effective-execution` when you need the effective provider, topology, or requested execution path.
When `EXECUTION_MODE=governed_ccb`, do not ask the user to configure `PRIMARY_PROVIDER` or `PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY`. Those are local-provider host preferences, not governed CCB config keys.

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present and `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no` and `GOVERNED_READY` is `yes`, use AskUserQuestion to persist the execution preference:

> Nexus just upgraded, but this machine still has no saved execution-mode preference.
> Repo mode only tells you whether the repo is solo or collaborative.
> Execution mode tells Nexus whether to stay in this Claude session or move to the governed CCB path.
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose B if you want the standard governed Nexus path, because CCB is already installed. Completeness: 9/10.
> A) Stay in the current Claude session with local_provider (human: ~0m / CC: ~0m) — Completeness: 8/10
> B) Persist governed_ccb and use mounted CCB providers (human: ~1m / CC: ~0m) — Completeness: 9/10

If A:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set execution_mode local_provider
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set primary_provider claude
```
Then explain that the current session can continue with `local_provider`, and if `PROVIDER_TOPOLOGY` is empty the default local topology is `single_agent`. Claude local-provider topologies invoke the local Claude CLI; inside Claude Code they are guarded unless `NEXUS_ALLOW_NESTED_CLAUDE=1` is set.

If B:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set execution_mode governed_ccb
```
Then explain that `governed_ccb` requires active CCB providers for this repo, and that the standard way to start them is `tmux` with `ccb codex gemini claude` if they are not already mounted.

If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>` is present and `EXECUTION_MODE_CONFIGURED` is `no` and `GOVERNED_READY` is `no`, tell the user Nexus is defaulting to `local_provider` for this host/session. If `CCB_AVAILABLE` is `no`, say that CCB is not detected. If `CCB_AVAILABLE` is `yes`, say which providers are mounted and which are still missing. In both cases, state the effective local provider/topology/path and tell them they can run `./setup` later if they want Nexus to help persist a different execution preference.

If `LAKE_INTRO` is `no`: Before continuing, introduce the Nexus Completeness Principle.
Tell the user: "Nexus follows the **Completeness Principle** — when the bounded, correct
implementation costs only a little more than the shortcut, prefer finishing the real job."

Then run:

```bash
touch ~/.nexus/.completeness-intro-seen
```

This only happens once.

If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `no` AND `LAKE_INTRO` is `yes`: After the lake intro is handled,
ask the user about proactive behavior. Use AskUserQuestion:

> Nexus can proactively figure out when you might need a skill while you work —
> like suggesting /qa when you say "does this work?" or /investigate when you hit
> a bug. We recommend keeping this on — it speeds up every part of your workflow.

Options:
- A) Keep it on (recommended)
- B) Turn it off — I'll type /commands myself

If A: run `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set proactive true`
If B: run `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set proactive false`

Always run:
```bash
touch ~/.nexus/.proactive-prompted
```

This only happens once. If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`, skip this entirely.

If `HAS_ROUTING` is `no` AND `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `false` AND `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`:
Check if a CLAUDE.md file exists in the project root. If it does not exist, create it.
Before prompting, treat either the standard `## Nexus Skill Routing` section or any
existing instruction that routes lifecycle work through `/discover` to `/closeout`
as equivalent Nexus routing guidance. If equivalent guidance already exists, skip this entirely.

Use AskUserQuestion:

> Nexus works best when your project's CLAUDE.md includes canonical Nexus command
> routing guidance. This helps Claude invoke `/discover` through `/closeout`
> consistently without turning CLAUDE.md into a second contract layer.

Options:
- A) Add Nexus invocation guidance to CLAUDE.md (recommended)
- B) No thanks, I'll invoke Nexus commands manually

If A: Append this section to the end of CLAUDE.md only when the file does not already
contain equivalent Nexus routing guidance:

```markdown

## Nexus Skill Routing

When the user's request matches a canonical Nexus command, invoke that command first.
This guidance helps command discovery only.
Contracts, transitions, governed artifacts, and lifecycle truth are owned by `lib/nexus/`
and canonical `.planning/` artifacts.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke discover
- Scope definition, requirements framing, non-goals → invoke frame
- Architecture review, execution readiness, implementation planning → invoke plan
- Governed routing and handoff packaging → invoke handoff
- Bounded implementation execution → invoke build
- Code review, check my diff → invoke review
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke qa
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke ship
- Final governed verification and closure → invoke closeout
```

Do not auto-commit the file. After updating `CLAUDE.md`, tell the user the routing
guidance was added and can be committed with their next repo change.

If B: run `~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set routing_declined true`
Say "No problem. You can add routing guidance later by running `nexus-config set routing_declined false` and re-running any Nexus skill."

This only happens once per project. If `HAS_ROUTING` is `yes` or `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `true`, skip this entirely.

## Voice

**Tone:** direct, concrete, sharp, never corporate, never academic. Sound like a builder, not a consultant. Name the file, the function, the command. No filler, no throat-clearing.

**Writing rules:** No em dashes (use commas, periods, "..."). No AI vocabulary (delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, etc.). Short paragraphs. End with what to do.

The user always has context you don't. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision — the user decides.

## Stage-Aware Local Topology Chooser

If `EXECUTION_MODE=local_provider` and `PRIMARY_PROVIDER=claude`, ask the user which local execution topology to use before starting `/review`.

RECOMMENDATION: Choose C when available because review benefits from independent code / security / test / performance / design perspectives challenging each other. Completeness: 10/10.

Use AskUserQuestion with these options:
- A) `single_agent` - One Claude subprocess for direct terminal sessions. Lowest coordination overhead and safest for sequential work.
- B) `subagents` - Focused local Claude CLI subagents. Good for quick parallel checks whose results return to the lead.
- C) `agent_team` — Claude Code Agent Teams. Best when teammates should coordinate, challenge each other, or work from independent perspectives.

If `LOCAL_CLAUDE_AGENT_TEAM_READY` is not `yes`, still show option C but mark it unavailable and include `LOCAL_CLAUDE_AGENT_TEAM_REASON`. Do not set `agent_team` unless the user explicitly chooses to configure Claude Code first.

Stage-specific guidance:
- `/review`: `agent_team` maps naturally to code / security / test / performance / design reviewers.
- `/investigate`: `agent_team` maps naturally to competing root-cause hypotheses.
- `/frame` and `/plan`: `agent_team` maps naturally to CEO / engineering / design / risk perspectives.
- `/build`: prefer `single_agent` for same-file edits or tightly coupled implementation; only choose team modes when file ownership can be split.
- `/ship`: `subagents` or `agent_team` can cover release / QA / security / docs-deploy gates.

If the user chooses A:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set provider_topology single_agent
```

If the user chooses B:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set provider_topology subagents
```

If the user chooses C and `LOCAL_CLAUDE_AGENT_TEAM_READY=yes`:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-config set provider_topology agent_team
```

After setting the topology, continue with the canonical Nexus command.

## Contributor Mode

If `_CONTRIB` is `true`: you are in **contributor mode**. At the end of each major workflow step, rate your Nexus experience 0-10. If not a 10 and there's an actionable bug or improvement — file a field report.

**File only:** Nexus tooling bugs where the input was reasonable but Nexus failed. **Skip:** user app bugs, network errors, auth failures on user's site.

**To file:** write `~/.nexus/contributor-logs/{slug}.md`:
```
# {Title}
**What I tried:** {action} | **What happened:** {result} | **Rating:** {0-10}
## Repro
1. {step}
## What would make this a 10
{one sentence}
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD} | **Version:** {version} | **Skill:** /{skill}
```
Slug: lowercase hyphens, max 60 chars. Skip if exists. Max 3/session. File inline, don't stop.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```

## Plan Mode Safe Operations

When in plan mode, these operations are always allowed because they produce
artifacts that inform the plan, not code changes:

- `$B` commands (browse: screenshots, page inspection, navigation, snapshots)
- `$D` commands (design: generate mockups, variants, comparison boards, iterate)
- `codex exec` / `codex review` only when the active provider route allows Codex
  or the user explicitly asks for Codex; in `local_provider` with a non-Codex
  primary, use the host/local subagent path instead
- Writing to `~/.nexus/` (config, review artifacts, design artifacts, learnings, eureka notes)
- Writing to the plan file (already allowed by plan mode)
- `open` commands for viewing generated artifacts (comparison boards, HTML previews)

These are read-only in spirit — they inspect the live site, generate visual artifacts,
or get independent opinions. They do NOT modify project source files.

## Plan Status Footer

When you are in plan mode and about to call ExitPlanMode:

1. Check if the plan file already has a `## NEXUS REVIEW REPORT` section.
2. If it DOES — skip (a review skill already wrote a richer report).
3. If it does NOT — run this command:

\`\`\`bash
~/.claude/skills/nexus/bin/nexus-review-read
\`\`\`

Then write a `## NEXUS REVIEW REPORT` section to the end of the plan file:

- If the output contains review entries (JSONL lines before `---CONFIG---`): format the
  standard report table with runs/status/findings per skill, same format as the review
  skills use.
- If the output is `NO_REVIEWS` or empty: write this placeholder table:

\`\`\`markdown
## NEXUS REVIEW REPORT

| Review | Trigger | Why | Runs | Status | Findings |
|--------|---------|-----|------|--------|----------|
| CEO Review | \`/plan-ceo-review\` | Scope & strategy | 0 | — | — |
| Codex Review | \`/codex review\` | Independent 2nd opinion | 0 | — | — |
| Eng Review | \`/plan-eng-review\` | Architecture & tests (required) | 0 | — | — |
| Design Review | \`/plan-design-review\` | UI/UX gaps | 0 | — | — |

**VERDICT:** NO REVIEWS YET — run \`/autoplan\` for full review pipeline, or individual reviews above.
\`\`\`

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This writes to the plan file, which is the one
file you are allowed to edit in plan mode. The plan file review report is part of the
plan's living status.

# /review — Nexus Governed Review

Nexus-owned review guidance for governed dual-audit completion, synthesis, and explicit gate state.

## Iron Laws (mandatory; non-negotiable)

These three rules apply to every `/review` invocation regardless of provider, topology, or run mode. They are short and absolute on purpose — discipline that lives in qualifiers does not survive contact with the LLM at decision time. `/review` is the gate `/ship` reads; ambiguity in the verdict propagates straight to a release decision.

### Law 1 — Review Content Contract

A `/review` verdict — `pass`, `pass_with_advisories`, or `fail` — requires four artifacts visible in the advisor record at decision time:

1. **Scope summary** — what changed, in concrete terms (files touched, behavior modified). Not "the PR diff" as a substitute; a one-paragraph synthesis the reviewer wrote in this turn.
2. **Fresh test evidence** — the verification command for this change ran in the current message AND its output is attached. Stale CI runs from a previous turn are not evidence — they describe a different state of the tree.
3. **Risk register** — listed risks with severity (`block`, `advisory`, `nit`). An empty list is acceptable only when paired with a one-sentence justification. "Looks good" without enumeration is not a risk register.
4. **Explicit gate verdict** — one of `pass` | `pass_with_advisories` | `fail`, written into the advisor record in this turn. The runtime advisor reads what is attached, not what is remembered.

A review that omits any of the four is not a review; it is an opinion. Opinions don't open gates.

### Law 2 — Two-Round Protocol For Block-Grade Advisories

When Pass 1 of `/review` produces ANY `block`-severity advisory, single-pass completion is forbidden:

1. The block-grade advisory is recorded in the advisor record.
2. `/build` is re-entered to address it (per `/build` Law 3 — prior advisories are address-or-dispute).
3. `/review` is re-entered for Pass 2. Pass 2 verifies the specific advisory has been closed AND no regression was introduced. Re-running the same audit set is the minimum; spot-checking the changed area is the recommended.
4. Only after Pass 2 completes clean may the gate verdict become `pass` or `pass_with_advisories`.

Pass 1 alone never produces `pass` when block-grade advisories exist. The advisor record carries the round number (`pass_round: 1` or `2`) and downstream `/ship` reads it.

Single-round review on block-grade findings is the most common path to "we shipped a regression that the review caught."

### Law 3 — Reviewer Disagreement Protocol

When 2+ audit slots disagree on a finding (e.g., `codex` flags `block`, `gemini` flags `nit`, `local_a` is silent), the synthesis MUST enumerate the disagreement explicitly. Silent averaging is forbidden.

For every disagreed finding, the synthesis records:

- **The conflicting verdicts** — which slot said what
- **The accepted verdict** — which slot's call the synthesis is taking
- **The rationale** — why this slot is being trusted on this specific finding (e.g., "codex inspected the failure path the others didn't read"; "gemini misread the type signature")
- **The pushed-back verdicts** — which slot calls are being explicitly NOT followed, and why

When synthesis cannot choose without speculation, escalate via `AskUserQuestion`. Do not pick the majority and move on; do not pick the most cautious and move on. Either choice without rationale is silent averaging.

The reason: outside voices are signals, not votes. Two-out-of-three agreement on a wrong call is still a wrong call. The synthesis is responsible for the verdict, and the advisor record carries that responsibility.

## How to run /review

These steps execute one `/review` run. Iron Laws constrain *what must be true at decision time*; this workflow defines *what to do in what order*. Both apply.

### Step 1 — Read the build result

Open `.planning/current/build/build-result.md` and the most recent `/build` `status.json`. Confirm what changed, which acceptance criteria the implementer claimed satisfied, and which verification commands ran in the build turn. The Scope summary required by Law 1 #1 is written from this read — not paraphrased from the diff.

If `.planning/current/plan/design-contract.md` is present, read it too. Per the Artifact Contract, missing design-contract provenance on a material design-bearing run blocks `/review` instead of silently proceeding.

### Step 2 — Dispatch the dual audit slots

Run two independent audits. The standard pairing is `codex` + `gemini`; the local pairing is `local_a` + `local_b`. Pass each slot:

- The diff against the base branch
- The acceptance criteria from `/plan` Law 1
- The fresh test evidence from Step 1

Two slots are the floor — Law 3 only triggers when 2+ slots disagree, so a single-slot review cannot satisfy the disagreement protocol.

### Step 3 — Collect audit outputs

Wait for both slots to return. For each, capture:

- The findings list
- Each finding's severity (`block`, `advisory`, `nit`)
- The provenance signature (which audit slot, which model, what diff range)

If either slot returned silent or empty output, treat that as a slot failure — re-dispatch or note the gap explicitly. A silent slot is not "no findings"; it's missing evidence.

### Step 4 — Synthesize per Law 1

Write the four required artifacts into the advisor record this turn:

1. **Scope summary** — one paragraph synthesizing what changed (per Law 1 #1).
2. **Fresh test evidence** — the verification command for this change ran in this message; output attached (per Law 1 #2). Stale CI runs from a previous turn don't count.
3. **Risk register** — every finding with severity, with one-sentence justification per item (per Law 1 #3). An empty register requires an explicit "no risks identified because..." note.
4. **Explicit gate verdict** — `pass` | `pass_with_advisories` | `fail` (per Law 1 #4).

A review that omits any of the four is an opinion, not a verdict.

### Step 5 — If any finding is block-grade, route to Pass 2 protocol

Per Law 2, a Pass 1 verdict cannot become `pass` or `pass_with_advisories` while any `block`-severity advisory is open. Use `AskUserQuestion`:

> "Pass 1 found block-grade advisories. Route to (a) `/build --review-advisory-disposition fix_before_qa` to address them, (b) `/qa --review-advisory-disposition continue_to_qa` to continue with advisories noted, or (c) `/qa --review-advisory-disposition defer_to_follow_on` to defer?"

These three dispositions are the governed advisory choices the Completion Advisor footer enumerates — the AskUserQuestion gate surfaces them at the Law 2 branching moment so the operator picks before status is written.

After `/build` addresses the advisory, re-enter `/review` for Pass 2. Pass 2 must verify the specific advisory closed AND no regression introduced. The advisor record's `pass_round` field tracks 1 or 2; `/ship` Law 1 reads it.

### Step 6 — If audit slots disagree, apply the disagreement protocol

Per Law 3, when 2+ slots return conflicting verdicts on the same finding, the synthesis enumerates:

- Which slot said what
- Which slot's call is being accepted
- Why that slot is trusted on this specific finding
- Which slot calls are being explicitly NOT followed, and why

When the synthesis cannot choose without speculation, escalate via `AskUserQuestion` (Law 3 already gates this path). Do not silent-average and move on.

### Step 7 — Write status with verdict and pass_round

Run the canonical command (in the Routing section below). It writes audits to `.planning/audits/current/*`, the gate verdict to `.planning/current/review/status.json` with `pass_round: 1` or `2`, and `learning-candidates.json` if any audit returned valid candidates. The advisor record carries the verdict; `/ship`, `/qa`, and `/closeout` read it.

## Operator Checklist

- run dual audits through Nexus-owned review completion
- verify implementation and audit provenance consistency
- synthesize the audit set and record the gate decision

## Artifact Contract

Writes `.planning/audits/current/*`, `.planning/current/review/status.json`, and optionally `.planning/current/review/learning-candidates.json`.

When `.planning/current/plan/design-contract.md` is present for a material design-bearing run, `/review` treats it as required provenance, passes it as a predecessor artifact, and limits visual findings to explicit contract violations. Missing design-contract provenance blocks review instead of silently proceeding.

When the review audits return valid `learning_candidates`, `/review` persists them in the optional learning-candidates artifact and records the path in review status metadata and the ledger artifact index. `/closeout` may consume that artifact when assembling run learnings.

## Routing

Advance to `/qa`, `/ship`, or `/closeout` only through Nexus-authored review completion state. Superpowers review discipline and CCB dual-audit transport remain subordinate runtime seams and never own lifecycle authority.

Run:

```bash
_REPO_CWD="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
_NEXUS_ROOT="~/.claude/skills/nexus"
[ -d "$_REPO_CWD/.claude/skills/nexus" ] && _NEXUS_ROOT="$_REPO_CWD/.claude/skills/nexus"
cd "$_NEXUS_ROOT" && NEXUS_PROJECT_CWD="$_REPO_CWD" ./bin/nexus review
```

## Typical prompts

These are example user requests `/review` handles well. The skill produces an explicit gate verdict (`pass` | `pass_with_advisories` | `fail`) and persists the four required artifacts (scope summary, fresh test evidence, risk register, verdict) per Law 1.

### Prompt 1 — Standard dual-audit review

> "Review the change I just built on this branch."

Step 1 reads `build-result.md` and the prior `/build` status. Step 2 dispatches `codex` + `gemini` audit slots against the diff. Step 3 collects findings with severity tags. Step 4 synthesizes the four Law 1 artifacts into the advisor record. If no block-grade findings, the verdict is `pass` or `pass_with_advisories` and `/qa` is the typical next stage. The advisor record's `pass_round` is `1`.

### Prompt 2 — Block-grade finding requires Pass 2

> "Codex flagged a P1 issue — can we still ship?"

Step 4 records the block-grade advisory in the risk register. Step 5 fires the AskUserQuestion gate: `fix_before_qa`, `continue_to_qa`, or `defer_to_follow_on`. Per Law 2, Pass 1 cannot return `pass` while the block is open — the operator picks the disposition, `/build` addresses it, then `/review` Pass 2 verifies closure with `pass_round: 2` recorded in the advisor record.

### Prompt 3 — Audit slots disagree

> "Codex says block, Gemini says nit, what's the call?"

Step 6 applies Law 3's disagreement protocol: enumerate the conflicting verdicts, name the accepted verdict, justify the choice on this specific finding, list the pushed-back calls with reasons. Silent averaging is forbidden. If the synthesis can't choose without speculation, Law 3 escalates via `AskUserQuestion` and the operator decides.

These prompts test that `/review` produces a complete verdict contract per Law 1, applies Law 2 on block-grade findings, and applies Law 3 on slot disagreement — not a "looks good" opinion.

## Completion Advisor

After `/review` returns, prefer the runtime JSON field `completion_advisor`. If the host only has
filesystem access, or the field is absent, fall back to `.planning/current/review/completion-advisor.json`.
If the runtime exited nonzero, inspect `completion_context.completion_advisor` from the error JSON
envelope before falling back to disk. Treat that advisor as the canonical next-step contract.

Read and summarize:

- `summary`
- `stage_outcome`
- `interaction_mode`
- `requires_user_choice`
- `choice_reason`
- `primary_next_actions`
- `alternative_next_actions`
- `recommended_side_skills`
- `stop_action`
- `project_setup_gaps`
- `suppressed_surfaces`
- `default_action_id`

If `interaction_mode` is `summary_only`, do not call AskUserQuestion. Print the advisor
`summary`, any `project_setup_gaps`, and the invocation for the `default_action_id` if one exists.

If the session is interactive and `interaction_mode` is not `summary_only`, always use
AskUserQuestion for `/review` completion.

If the host cannot display AskUserQuestion, rerun `/review` with `--output interactive`
to print the same runtime-owned chooser in the terminal. Do not reconstruct choices
from `status.json`.

If `interaction_mode` is `recommended_choice`, present:

1. recommended primary action
2. other primary actions
3. alternatives
4. recommended side skills
5. `stop_action`

If `interaction_mode` is `required_choice`, present only the actions emitted by the advisor.

Use each action's `label` and `description`. If an action has `visibility_reason`,
`why_this_skill`, or `evidence_signal`, include it in the explanation so the user sees
why it is showing up now.

After the user chooses an action, run the selected `invocation` unless the selected action
is `stop_action` or has no invocation.

Do not reconstruct advisory logic from `status.json`. Review advisory disposition is runtime-owned
through the advisor actions themselves. If `/review` passed with advisories, the advisor will emit
the exact governed choices, including:

- `/build --review-advisory-disposition fix_before_qa`
- `/qa --review-advisory-disposition continue_to_qa`
- `/qa --review-advisory-disposition defer_to_follow_on`

If the advisor recommends `/simplify`, `/design-review`, `/benchmark`, or `/cso`, those came from structured
verification-matrix support skill signals and should be offered as side skills after the canonical
governed action.

If the session is non-interactive, print the advisor `summary` and the invocation for the
`default_action_id` when one exists.
