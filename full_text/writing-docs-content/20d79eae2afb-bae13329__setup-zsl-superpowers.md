description: Sets up an `## Agent skills` block in AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md and `docs/agents/` so the engineering skills know this repo's issue tracker (GitHub, local markdown, or a hybrid local-markdown-plus-GitHub-mirror), triage label vocabulary, domain doc layout, ship style (PR vs direct push), and — optionally — the remote claude.ai environment the overnight agent loop schedules into. Run before first use of `to-issues`, `to-prd`, `triage`, `diagnose`, `tdd`, or `improve-codebase-architecture` — or if those skills appear to be missing context about the issue tracker, triage labels, domain docs, ship style, or remote agent environment.

# Setup ZSL Superpowers

Scaffold the per-repo configuration that the engineering skills assume:

- **Issue tracker** — where issues live (GitHub by default; local markdown is also supported out of the box)
- **Triage labels** — the strings used for the six canonical triage roles
- **Domain docs** — where `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs live, and the consumer rules for reading them
- **Ship style** — how changes reach the default branch (pull request or direct push)
- **Project board** *(optional)* — a GitHub Projects v2 board whose `Status` column should mirror triage labels and tdd lifecycle
- **Remote agent environment** *(optional)* — the claude.ai Claude Code environment id the overnight loop (`/afk-fanout`, `/afk-worker`) schedules remote sessions into

This is a prompt-driven skill, not a deterministic script. Explore, present what you found, confirm with the user, then write.

## Process

### 1. Explore

Look at the current repo to understand its starting state. Read whatever exists; don't assume:

- `git remote -v` and `.git/config` — is this a GitHub repo? Which one?
- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root — does either exist? Is there already an `## Agent skills` section in either?
- `CONTEXT.md` and `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the repo root
- `docs/adr/` and any `src/*/docs/adr/` directories
- `docs/agents/` — does this skill's prior output already exist?
- `.scratch/` — sign that a local-markdown issue tracker convention is already in use

### 2. Present findings and ask

Summarise what's present and what's missing. Then walk the user through the decisions **one at a time** — present a section, get the user's answer, then move to the next. Don't dump them all at once. Sections A–D are core; E (project board) and F (remote agent environment) are optional.

Assume the user does not know what these terms mean. Each section starts with a short explainer (what it is, why these skills need it, what changes if they pick differently). Then show the choices and the default.

**Section A — Issue tracker.**

> Explainer: The "issue tracker" is where issues live for this repo. Skills like `to-issues`, `triage`, `to-prd`, and `qa` read from and write to it — they need to know whether to call `gh issue create`, write a markdown file under `.scratch/`, or follow some other workflow you describe. Pick the place you actually track work for this repo.

Default posture: these skills were designed for GitHub. If a `git remote` points at GitHub, propose that. If a `git remote` points at GitLab (`gitlab.com` or a self-hosted host), propose GitLab. Otherwise (or if the user prefers), offer:

- **GitHub** — issues live in the repo's GitHub Issues (uses the `gh` CLI)
- **GitLab** — issues live in the repo's GitLab Issues (uses the [`glab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli) CLI)
- **Local markdown** — issues live as files under `.scratch/<NNN>-<feature-slug>/` in this repo (`<NNN>` is an auto-assigned 3-digit feature number; good for solo projects or repos without a remote)
- **Hybrid (local markdown + GitHub mirror)** — issues live in `.scratch/` as the source of truth, but each is mirrored to a thin linked GitHub issue so it can appear on a **project board** (Section E). Pick this when you want `.scratch/` ergonomics *and* a board — a board can only track GitHub-native objects, so plain local-markdown issues can't appear on one (see the coupling note below). Uses the [issue-tracker-hybrid.md](./issue-tracker-hybrid.md) seed.
- **Other** (Jira, Linear, etc.) — ask the user to describe the workflow in one paragraph; the skill will record it as freeform prose

> **Tracker ↔ board coupling.** A GitHub Projects v2 board (Section E) tracks items by their GitHub node ID. **GitHub** and **GitLab**(*) trackers have native issues to put on a board; **Local markdown** issues are files with no node ID, so they **cannot** appear on a board directly. If the user wants both local-markdown and a board, that's exactly the **Hybrid** option — don't quietly skip Section E, offer the hybrid. (*GitLab boards are out of scope here; Section E is GitHub Projects v2.)

**Section B — Triage label vocabulary.**

> Explainer: When the `triage` skill processes an incoming issue, it moves it through a state machine — needs evaluation, waiting on reporter, ready for an AFK agent to pick up, ready for a human, a tracking container for sub-issues, or won't fix. To do that, it needs to apply labels (or the equivalent in your issue tracker) that match strings *you've actually configured*. If your repo already uses different label names (e.g. `bug:triage` instead of `needs-triage`), map them here so the skill applies the right ones instead of creating duplicates.

The six canonical roles:

- `needs-triage` — maintainer needs to evaluate
- `needs-info` — waiting on reporter
- `ready-for-agent` — fully specified, AFK-ready (an agent can pick it up with no human context)
- `ready-for-human` — needs human implementation
- `tracking` — container/parent issue (e.g. PRD) — work lives in sub-issues
- `wontfix` — will not be actioned

Default: each role's string equals its name. Ask the user if they want to override any. If their issue tracker has no existing labels, the defaults are fine.

**Section C — Domain docs.**

> Explainer: Some skills (`improve-codebase-architecture`, `diagnose`, `tdd`) read a `CONTEXT.md` file to learn the project's domain language, and `docs/adr/` for past architectural decisions. They need to know whether the repo has one global context or multiple (e.g. a monorepo with separate frontend/backend contexts) so they look in the right place.

Confirm the layout:

- **Single-context** — one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. Most repos are this.
- **Multi-context** — `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root pointing to per-context `CONTEXT.md` files (typically a monorepo).

**Section D — Ship style.**

> Explainer: When a skill like `tdd` finishes a change, it needs to know how to get that change to the default branch. Team projects almost always go through pull requests; solo projects often push direct. This affects whether the skill creates a feature branch, opens a PR with a closing keyword, or commits straight to the default branch and closes the issue explicitly.

- **Pull request** — every change goes through a PR. Skills create a feature branch, push, and open a PR with `Closes #<issue>` in the body. The human merges.
- **Direct push** — changes go straight to the default branch. Skills commit, push, and close the related issue explicitly.

Default: pull request, unless the user specifies otherwise.

**Section E — Project board sync (optional, GitHub only).**

> Explainer: If you're using GitHub Projects v2 to track your issues on a board — or want to start — the `triage`, `to-issues`, and `tdd` skills can update a card's `Status` column whenever they change the issue's lifecycle (e.g. triaged to `ready-for-agent` → Status `Ready`; `tdd` starts work → `In progress`; PR opened → `In review`). Without this, the board stays static and you have to drag cards across columns manually. The skill can wire up either an existing board or create a fresh one. Skip this section if you don't want a project board, or if you'd rather wire the sync up via GitHub Actions yourself.

> **Requires a GitHub-native tracker.** A board tracks items by GitHub node ID, so this section only applies when Section A chose **GitHub** or **Hybrid (local markdown + GitHub mirror)**. If Section A chose plain **Local markdown**, there are no GitHub objects to track — don't silently skip the board the user asked for; go back and offer the **Hybrid** tracker, which mirrors each `.scratch/` issue to a GitHub issue precisely so it can land on a board. In hybrid mode the board tracks the **mirror issue**, and the skills resolve that issue's number from the `.scratch/` file's `github:` frontmatter before each Status update.

If the user opts in, walk them through:

1. **Identify or create the project.** Ask whether an existing Projects v2 board should be wired up, or whether to create a new one.

   - **Existing board.** Ask for the project URL (e.g. `https://github.com/users/<owner>/projects/<number>` or `https://github.com/orgs/<org>/projects/<number>`) or an `owner/number` pair. Parse out the owner and number.
   - **New board.** Ask for a title (default: the repo name). Determine the owner — for org-owned repos default to the org; for user repos default to the user — and confirm before creating. Then:
     ```bash
     gh project create --owner <owner> --title "<title>" --format json
     ```
     Capture the returned `number`, `url`, and node ID. Two follow-ups, both optional but worth offering:
     - **Link the repo** so issue/PR pickers know about the board: `gh project link <number> --owner <owner> --repo <owner>/<repo>`.
     - **Enable built-in workflows** at `<url>/workflows` — at minimum **Auto-add to project** (filter `repo:<owner>/<repo> is:issue,pr is:open`) and **Auto-close issue** (so closing an issue lands its card on `Done` without the skills having to). These workflows can't yet be toggled via `gh`; point the user at the URL.

2. **Fetch the project's structure.** Run:
   ```bash
   gh project view <number> --owner <owner> --format json
   gh project field-list <number> --owner <owner> --format json
   ```
   Capture the project's node ID (`PVT_…`), find the single-select field named `Status` (or whatever the user calls their lifecycle column — confirm with them), and capture its field ID (`PVTSSF_…`) and option IDs.

3. **Customise Status options if needed.** New projects ship with `Todo` / `In Progress` / `Done`. These skills work best with five canonical options — `Backlog`, `Ready`, `In progress`, `In review`, `Done` — because they map cleanly onto the triage and tdd lifecycle. Compare the option list from step 2 against the canonical five. If any are missing, ask the user which approach they'd prefer:

   - **Replace** the Status options with the canonical five (recommended for new boards, or older boards with no cards yet).

     > **Deterministic gate.** The `updateProjectV2Field` mutation has exactly one correct shape and the obvious prose drifts — the current GitHub GraphQL schema **rejects** a `projectId` argument on `UpdateProjectV2FieldInput` (`InputObject 'UpdateProjectV2FieldInput' doesn't accept argument 'projectId'`), so a hand-typed mutation that includes it fails mid-setup. Resolve and run the bundled script, which carries the correct mutation (it prints `optionId optionName` per option so you can capture the new IDs without a second `field-list`):
     >
     > ```bash
     > SSO=$({ ls "$PWD"/skills/*/setup-zsl-superpowers/scripts/set-status-options.sh 2>/dev/null
     >         ls "$HOME/.claude/skills/setup-zsl-superpowers/scripts/set-status-options.sh" 2>/dev/null
     >         ls -d "$HOME"/.claude/plugins/cache/zsl-superpowers/zsl/*/skills/*/setup-zsl-superpowers/scripts/set-status-options.sh 2>/dev/null | sort -Vr; } | head -1)
     > if [ -n "$SSO" ]; then
     >   bash "$SSO" <PVTSSF_…>      # the Status field ID from step 2
     > else
     >   echo "zsl-gate: set-status-options.sh unresolved — run the mutation by hand per the Fallback below"
     > fi
     > ```
     >
     > **Fallback** (if `$SSO` is empty): run the mutation directly — note **no `projectId`**, only `fieldId`:
     > ```bash
     > gh api graphql -f query='
     >   mutation($fieldId: ID!) {
     >     updateProjectV2Field(input: {
     >       fieldId: $fieldId
     >       singleSelectOptions: [
     >         {name: "Backlog",     color: GRAY,   description: ""}
     >         {name: "Ready",       color: BLUE,   description: ""}
     >         {name: "In progress", color: YELLOW, description: ""}
     >         {name: "In review",   color: PURPLE, description: ""}
     >         {name: "Done",        color: GREEN,  description: ""}
     >       ]
     >     }) {
     >       projectV2Field {
     >         ... on ProjectV2SingleSelectField { id options { id name } }
     >       }
     >     }
     >   }
     > ' -F fieldId=<PVTSSF_…>
     > ```

     Either way, capture the new option IDs (the script prints them; the fallback returns them in the response, or re-run `gh project field-list`). Note: `updateProjectV2Field` replaces the option set wholesale; any cards assigned to a removed option (e.g. `Todo`) become unassigned and need manual remapping. Don't run this on a board with live cards without warning the user first.
   - **Map** existing options onto the canonical states (recommended when the board already has live cards). Confirm a mapping with the user — e.g. `Todo → Backlog`, `In Progress → In progress` — and record it in `docs/agents/project-board.md` so the skills emit the right option IDs without mutating the field.

4. **Map canonical states to Status options.** Default mapping (override per user preference, or per the mapping agreed in step 3):

   | Skill action                                                      | Status option |
   |-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
   | `/triage` → `needs-triage` / `needs-info`                         | Backlog       |
   | `/triage` → `ready-for-agent` / `ready-for-human`                 | Ready         |
   | `/triage` → `tracking` / `/to-issues` parent                      | In progress   |
   | `/tdd` step 1 (work begins)                                       | In progress   |
   | `/tdd` ship in PR-style (PR opened)                               | In review     |
   | `/tdd-parallel` step 4 (integration PR opened) — bulk parent + every integrated sub-issue | In review     |
   | `/triage` → `wontfix`                                             | Done          |

   `/tdd` invoked with `--no-ship` (used by `/tdd-parallel` sub-agents) skips the per-slice "In review" update; the orchestrator handles the bulk transition when the consolidated integration PR opens.

   Issue closure (PR merged, direct-push commit, manual close) lands at `Done` automatically via the project's built-in **Auto-close issue** workflow — skills don't write `Done` themselves.
5. If the user's Status options don't include some of these labels (e.g. their column is named `In Review` not `In review`, or they have no `In progress`), confirm the substitutions before writing.

If the user opts out, do not write `docs/agents/project-board.md` — the skills detect its absence and silently skip the sync.

**Section F — Remote agent environment (optional).**

> Explainer: The overnight loop runs each PRD in its own remote claude.ai session. `/afk-fanout` (you run it in the evening) schedules one one-shot routine per PRD via the claude.ai routines API; each fires `/afk-worker` in a fresh remote session. To schedule those, `/afk-fanout` needs the **environment id** of a Claude Code environment on claude.ai for the sessions to run in. Skip this whole section if you don't intend to use the overnight loop — `/afk-fanout` just refuses at pre-flight until it's configured.

This section is more involved than A–E, so **walk it one decision at a time** — present a step, get the answer, then move on. Don't dump it all at once. If the user opts out at the top, do not write `docs/agents/remote-env.md` (`/afk-fanout` detects its absence and refuses; the rest of the loop is unaffected).

> **Lead with this — the environment is reusable, not per-repo.** A Claude Code *environment* on claude.ai is **repo-agnostic**: its config screen has only **Name / Network access / Environment variables / Setup script** — there is **no repo field**. The repo a routine works on is chosen *per-routine* (via `sources`, which `/afk-fanout` sets at schedule time from this repo's `origin`), not by the environment. So **one** generic environment (e.g. "Full Network + GH + Telegram") is reused across *every* project. The user very likely already has a usable one and does **not** need a new per-repo environment.

**F1 — Reuse an existing environment if there is one.** Before walking the form, try to auto-discover an environment id the user already has and offer to reuse it:

```
RemoteTrigger({ action: "list" })   →  for each trigger, job_config.ccr.environment_id
```

If any routine exists, surface its `environment_id` (looks like `env_016kJTSSQaEEUatC4vq82c1G`) and ask: "Reuse this environment for the overnight loop?" If yes, record it and **skip F2** (jump to F3 — verify its env vars + setup script match what the loop needs). Only build a new environment if none exists or the user wants a dedicated one.

**F2 — Create the environment (only if needed): walk the UI form field-by-field.** In claude.ai → **Code → Environments → New** (or **Update** an existing one). The form has exactly four fields:

- **Name** — a generic, reusable name, e.g. `Full Network + GH + Telegram`. Not a repo name; this environment serves all repos.
- **Network access** — **Full**. Needed for `git push`, the `gh` CLI, the Telegram Bot API, and package installs in the setup script. Anything less and workers can't push results or notify.
- **Environment variables** (the `.env` box) — paste exactly these (drop the two Telegram lines if Telegram isn't wanted — see F4):

  ```
  GH_TOKEN=<github PAT>
  AFK_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<from BotFather>     # only if Telegram opted in (F4)
  AFK_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=<chat id>              # only if Telegram opted in (F4)
  ZSL_SUPERPOWERS_REF=main
  ```

  ⚠️ **This box is NOT a secret vault.** The UI itself warns the values are *visible to anyone using this environment — don't add secrets*. So use a **minimally-scoped, ROTATABLE** GitHub PAT, never a broad personal token. The scopes the loop actually needs:
  - **read** on `zsl-superpowers` — the `SessionStart` hook clones it to provision the skills.
  - **read + write on the repos workers ship to** — `contents` + `pull requests` (a fine-grained PAT), or `repo` (classic). This is what lets `/tdd-parallel` push feature branches, open PRs, and push the `afk-runs` ledger branch.

  `ZSL_SUPERPOWERS_REF=main` pins which ref the skills-provisioning hook checks out (override to a tag/branch to freeze a version).

- **Setup script** — paste verbatim, and know *why* each line is there:

  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  apt update && apt install -y gh
  gh auth setup-git
  ```

  `apt install gh` puts the GitHub CLI on the box. **`gh auth setup-git` is the load-bearing line** and is the prerequisite that was previously missing from this setup: it configures git's credential helper to use `GH_TOKEN`, so raw **`git push`** authenticates — that's what the worker's `afk-runs` ledger-branch push and `/tdd-parallel`'s feature-branch push rely on. Installing `gh` **alone is not enough** for `git push`; without `gh auth setup-git`, pushes fail and results never come home.

**F3 — Obtain the environment id.** The id is **not shown in the env config dialog**, so don't make the user hunt. The reliable path (have the skill run it): read it off any routine via `RemoteTrigger({ action: "list" })` → `job_config.ccr.environment_id`. (If the env URL surfaces it, that works too — but the routines list is the dependable source.) Record this id; it's what goes into `remote-env.md` and what `/afk-fanout` schedules into.

**F4 — Telegram heads-up (optional within optional), fully walked.** Each worker can fire a best-effort one-line Telegram message when it finishes a PRD, so the user wakes to a status. If they want it, step them through it — don't just say "set two env vars":

1. **Create the bot.** Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), send `/newbot`, follow the prompts, and **capture the bot token** it returns (`AFK_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`).
2. **Get the chat id.** Have the user *message their new bot first* (send it any text — the bot can't see a chat until the user opens it), then have the skill run:
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates"
   ```
   Extract `result[].message.chat.id` — that's `AFK_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` (for a self-DM it's the user's own id). If `result` is empty, the user hasn't messaged the bot yet — prompt them to, then re-run.
3. **(Optional) confirm end-to-end.** Send one test message so the user sees it actually arrives:
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/sendMessage" -d chat_id=<CHAT_ID> -d text="afk loop wired up ✅"
   ```
4. **Record both as env vars** in the environment's `.env` box (F2) — `AFK_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `AFK_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`. The values never go in the repo; `remote-env.md` records only the var *names*. If they decline Telegram, workers skip the heads-up silently — it carries no load-bearing data.

**F5 — Write the remote-skills hook so the skills resolve in the remote session.** A scheduled routine fires in a fresh remote session with **no plugins installed**, and plugin availability is **not** configurable per claude.ai environment — so without provisioning, `/afk-worker` (and the skills it drives) won't resolve. The fix is a repo-level `SessionStart` hook that clones zsl-superpowers and symlinks its skills into `~/.claude/skills/` **only when `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true`** (a no-op locally, where the user has the plugin):

- Copy [remote-skills-hook.sh](./remote-skills-hook.sh) to `.claude/hooks/zsl-remote-skills.sh` in the target repo and `chmod +x` it.
- **Merge** a `SessionStart` entry into the repo's `.claude/settings.json` — append to the existing `SessionStart` array if one is present, never overwrite it (the repo may already have its own hooks):
  ```json
  {
    "hooks": {
      "SessionStart": [
        { "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/zsl-remote-skills.sh" } ] }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
There is no "install the plugin into the environment" lever — the repo provisions its own skills via this hook.

**F6 — Confirm a writable remote.** Workers `git push` their per-PRD results to a shared `afk-runs` git branch that `/morning-review` reconciles back into the tracker (`.scratch/` mode). The environment's PAT (F2) must have push access to this repo or results can't come home; `/afk-fanout` pre-flights this with `git push --dry-run`.

**F7 — Per-repo runtime credentials caveat.** Ask: *"Does this repo's tests or slices need cloud credentials at run time — e.g. AWS for infra work?"* If yes, those must **also** live in the environment's env vars — **static keys or a CI role**; interactive SSO won't work in a headless routine session — or workers will stall on integration tests. A generic environment with no cloud creds is fine for pure-code repos but **breaks infra repos**. (These are runtime creds for *this repo's* tests, distinct from the `GH_TOKEN` the loop itself needs.) Record any required cloud-cred var *names* in `remote-env.md` so the next operator knows the environment must carry them.

### 3. Confirm and edit

Show the user a draft of:

- The `## Agent skills` block to add to whichever of `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` is being edited (see step 4 for selection rules)
- The contents of `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`, `docs/agents/domain.md`, `docs/agents/ship-style.md`, (if Section E was answered yes) `docs/agents/project-board.md`, and (if Section F was answered yes) `docs/agents/remote-env.md`

Let them edit before writing.

### 4. Write

**Pick the file to edit:**

- If `CLAUDE.md` exists, edit it.
- Else if `AGENTS.md` exists, edit it.
- If neither exists, ask the user which one to create — don't pick for them.

Never create `AGENTS.md` when `CLAUDE.md` already exists (or vice versa) — always edit the one that's already there.

If an `## Agent skills` block already exists in the chosen file, update its contents in-place rather than appending a duplicate. Don't overwrite user edits to the surrounding sections.

The block:

```markdown
## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

[one-line summary of where issues are tracked]. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

[one-line summary of the label vocabulary]. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

[one-line summary of layout — "single-context" or "multi-context"]. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

### Ship style

[one-line summary — "pull request" or "direct push"]. See `docs/agents/ship-style.md`.
```

If Section E was answered yes, also append:

```markdown
### Project board

[one-line summary — project name and URL]. See `docs/agents/project-board.md`.
```

If Section F was answered yes, also append:

```markdown
### Remote agent environment

[one-line summary — the environment id]. See `docs/agents/remote-env.md`.
```

Then write the docs files using the seed templates in this skill folder as a starting point:

- [issue-tracker-github.md](./issue-tracker-github.md) — GitHub issue tracker
- [issue-tracker-gitlab.md](./issue-tracker-gitlab.md) — GitLab issue tracker
- [issue-tracker-local.md](./issue-tracker-local.md) — local-markdown issue tracker
- [issue-tracker-hybrid.md](./issue-tracker-hybrid.md) — hybrid local-markdown source-of-truth + GitHub mirror (use when Section A chose Hybrid; fill the repo `<owner>/<repo>` and confirm the `.scratch/` is the source of truth)
- [triage-labels.md](./triage-labels.md) — label mapping
- [domain.md](./domain.md) — domain doc consumer rules + layout
- [ship-style-pr.md](./ship-style-pr.md) — pull-request workflow
- [ship-style-direct.md](./ship-style-direct.md) — direct push to default branch
- [project-board.md](./project-board.md) — GitHub Projects v2 sync (only when Section E was answered yes)
- [remote-env.md](./remote-env.md) — remote agent environment for the overnight loop (only when Section F was answered yes)
- [remote-skills-hook.sh](./remote-skills-hook.sh) — the `SessionStart` hook that provisions the skills in remote sessions (only when Section F was answered yes); copy to the target repo's `.claude/hooks/zsl-remote-skills.sh`

For "other" issue trackers, write `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` from scratch using the user's description. For `docs/agents/project-board.md`, fill the template placeholders with the project node ID, Status field ID, and option IDs you discovered in Section E. For `docs/agents/remote-env.md`, fill the seed from Section F: the environment id (replacing the `env_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` placeholder), the chosen env **name**, the env-var **names** the environment must carry (never values — `GH_TOKEN`, the Telegram pair if opted in, any F7 cloud-cred names), and confirm the verbatim setup script and PAT-scope notes match what you walked. When Section F was answered yes, also install the remote-skills hook (copy `remote-skills-hook.sh` → `.claude/hooks/zsl-remote-skills.sh`, `chmod +x`, and merge the `SessionStart` entry into `.claude/settings.json` per Section F step F5 — append, don't overwrite).

### 5. Migrate local-markdown layout (local-markdown only)

Only runs if Section A selected local-markdown. Two one-time migrations, **in this order** — the folder rename must run before the number/date backfill, because the backfill globs `.scratch/_done/` and treats anything else directly under `.scratch/` as an active feature, so a stale `.scratch/done/` would get mis-numbered.

#### 5a. Rename legacy archive folders `done/` → `_done/`

Older repos archived closed work under `done/`; the convention is now `_done/` so the archive sorts to the top of its parent directory. Detect first (read-only):

```bash
# Feature archive still using the old name:
[ -d .scratch/done ] && echo ".scratch/done"
# Per-feature issue archives still using the old name (active + archived features):
find .scratch -type d -path '*/issues/done' 2>/dev/null
```

If both probes print nothing, the repo is already on the new layout — skip to 5b. Otherwise show the maintainer the moves and, on confirmation, apply them with `git mv` so history follows the rename:

```bash
[ -d .scratch/done ] && git mv .scratch/done .scratch/_done
for d in $(find .scratch -type d -path '*/issues/done' 2>/dev/null); do
  git mv "$d" "${d%/done}/_done"
done
```

Move the feature archive first so the loop's `find` also sweeps the just-renamed `.scratch/_done/*/issues/done`. Nothing is deleted and no numbers change — only the two folder names. Use plain `mv` if `.scratch/` isn't git-tracked. Commit as its own `chore: migrate archive folders done/ → _done/`, or fold it into the backfill commit below.

#### 5b. Backfill feature numbers and archive date prefixes

Check whether any existing features lack the new prefixes:

```bash
# Active features missing the <NNN>- number prefix:
find .scratch -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d \
  -not -name '_done' \
  -not -name '[0-9][0-9][0-9]-*' 2>/dev/null

# Archived features missing either the date or the number (or both):
find .scratch/_done -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d \
  -not -name '[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9]-*' 2>/dev/null
```

If both outputs are empty, skip this step.

Otherwise, offer a single unified backfill that handles both the number prefix (active and archive) and the date prefix (archive only) in one pass.

#### Algorithm

1. **Catalog** every feature directory across `.scratch/` (exclude `_done`) and `.scratch/_done/`.

2. **Classify** each by its current prefix state:

   - **Active, numbered** (`^[0-9]{3}-`) — preserve as-is.
   - **Active, unnumbered** — assign a number.
   - **Archived, date+number** (`^[0-9]{8}-[0-9]{3}-`) — preserve as-is.
   - **Archived, date-only** (`^[0-9]{8}-` but not the above) — insert a number after the date.
   - **Archived, unprefixed** — assign both a date and a number.

3. **Determine the canonical date** for every feature that needs one. Use the commit when the directory (or its current name) was added:

   ```bash
   git log -1 --diff-filter=A --format=%ad --date=format:%Y%m%d -- <path>
   ```

   Fall back to the most recent touching commit if `--diff-filter=A` returns nothing. If neither yields a date (no git history for the path), prompt the user — don't silently default to today.

   For *active* features, the date is used only as a sort key for number assignment; it isn't written into the directory name.

4. **Sort** all features needing a number by canonical date (oldest first, so the lowest numbers go to the earliest features).

5. **Assign numbers**: existing numbers are preserved. New numbers start from `max(existing) + 1` (or `001` if no features are numbered yet) and are assigned sequentially in date order.

6. **Compose** the full proposed rename list, with a one-line note explaining what changed:

   ```
   .scratch/auth/                   → .scratch/001-auth/                       (assigned number 001)
   .scratch/billing/                → .scratch/002-billing/                    (assigned number 002)
   .scratch/_done/oauth/             → .scratch/_done/20251020-003-oauth/        (assigned date 2025-10-20, number 003)
   .scratch/_done/20251114-payments/ → .scratch/_done/20251114-004-payments/    (assigned number 004)
   ```

7. **Ask**: "Apply these renames in a single commit?" Wait for confirmation. The maintainer may want to override a date, override a number (e.g. to keep an external reference stable), or skip specific entries entirely — accept edits before applying.

8. **Apply** each rename via `git mv`, then commit as a single migration commit:

   ```
   chore: backfill feature numbers and archive date prefixes
   ```

Don't run any `git mv` without explicit confirmation. Backfilled values are best-effort heuristics from git history; the maintainer is the authority on edge cases (e.g. a feature whose archive commit doesn't reflect the real ship date, or a number that should be preserved to match an external system).

### 6. Done

Tell the user the setup is complete and which engineering skills will now read from these files. If Section F was configured, note that `/afk-fanout` will read `docs/agents/remote-env.md` to schedule the overnight loop. Mention they can edit `docs/agents/*.md` directly later — re-running this skill is only necessary if they want to switch issue trackers or restart from scratch.
