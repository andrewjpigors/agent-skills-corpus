# Slack

Access Slack through the `slack` tool. Translates natural
language requests into structured API calls.

When composing messages on behalf of the user (not just
relaying information), follow the user's writing voice and
prose style guides. The message should sound like the user
wrote it.

## Authentication

User must run `/slack-setup` once to authenticate. Credentials
persist across sessions. The tool auto-prompts if not set up.

## User Identity

The extension tracks the authenticated user's Slack handle in
session state. Once populated, it's injected into agent context
automatically so you always know who you're acting on behalf of.

**First session**: call `get_user` with the user's handle early
in the conversation to verify identity and populate the session
state. Don't guess handles from project context; verify them.

**Subsequent sessions**: the identity is restored automatically.
Use the known handle for `from:` queries without re-verifying.

## Core Principle: Present Results, Don't Parrot

After a tool call returns, **summarise the results conversationally**.
Don't just say "here are the results" — the user already sees
the collapsed tool output. Add value by highlighting what matters:

- Name the people involved and what they said
- Call out the key topic or decision
- Note dates/timing if relevant
- Mention thread depth or follow-up if the user might want more

**Bad:** "Here are your last 5 messages to Chao Duan."
**Good:** "Your last 5 messages to Chao Duan were yesterday evening,
discussing M5 risk areas and an upcoming call. You offered to help
with triaging issues."

## Identifier Resolution

The `channel` parameter accepts **any identifier format**
uniformly across all actions:

- Channel names: `"gitstream"` or `"#gitstream"`
- Channel IDs: `"C0AJY0FLK8Q"`
- User IDs: `"U093FQUHEJG"` (resolves to the DM conversation)
- Slack permalink URLs: passed as `target`, parsed automatically

The tool resolves all identifiers before processing. You don't
need to worry about which format a particular action expects;
use whatever you have from previous context.

**One exception**: `search_messages` and `search_files` cannot
search inside DM or group DM conversations. If you pass a user
ID or DM channel ID as `channel` to a search action, the tool
returns a clear error directing you to use `list_messages`
instead. This is a Slack API limitation, not a tool limitation.

## Translating User Intent

### "Check Slack for X" / "Search Slack for X"
→ `search_messages` with `query: "X"`

### "Messages from [person]" / "What did [person] say"
→ `search_messages` with `from: "person"` (and optionally `query`)
- Use the person's Slack handle (first.last format)
- `query` is optional when structured params (`from`, `with`,
  `channel`, `after`, `before`) are present — it defaults to `*`

### "Messages in [channel] about X"
→ `search_messages` with `query: "X"` and `channel: "channel-name"`

### "Messages I sent to [person]"
→ `list_messages` with the person's user ID as `channel`,
  then filter output to messages from the authenticated user.
  Falls back to `search_messages` with `from: "me"` and
  `with: "person"` when keyword filtering is needed, but
  note that search results include shared channels.

### "My DMs with [person]" / "Conversations with [person]"
→ **Always** use `list_messages` with the person's user ID
  as the `channel`. The resolver calls `conversations.open`
  to find the DM automatically. This returns only DM messages
  — complete and in order.

  **Do not** use `search_messages` with `with:` for DM
  history. Search mixes in shared channel results, misses
  messages the index doesn't match, and is unreliable for
  comprehensive queries. Only use `with:` when you need
  keyword filtering across all conversations (DMs, group
  DMs and channels together) and tell the user the results
  include shared channel messages.

  To get the user ID, call `get_user` first if you only
  have a handle.

### "Last thread I started in [channel]"
→ `search_messages` with `from: "me"` and `channel: "channel-name"`
  Slack has no "thread parent only" operator. `is:thread`
  matches replies too. To find threads the user *started*,
  look for messages with `[N replies]` in the output — these
  are thread parents. Messages without a reply count are
  either top-level posts with no thread or replies within
  someone else's thread.

### "Show me the thread" / "Get the full thread"
→ `get_thread` with the message's `channel` + `ts`, or with
  `target` if you have a permalink URL from search results.
  Both approaches work identically — use whichever you have.

  Every message in tool results includes a `(ts:...)` value
  in its header line. Use that exact value. **Never fabricate
  or guess a timestamp** — Slack timestamps are precise
  identifiers, not derivable from human-readable dates.

### "Get that specific message from the thread"
→ `get_message` with `channel`, `ts` (the reply's ts) and
  `thread_ts` (the thread parent's ts).

  Without `thread_ts`, `get_message` only finds top-level
  channel messages. Thread replies require both timestamps
  because Slack's API uses the parent ts to locate the thread
  and the reply ts to find the specific message within it.

  The thread parent's ts is the first message's `(ts:...)`
  in a `get_thread` result.

### "What's happening in #channel" / "Last N messages in #channel"
→ `list_messages` with `channel: "channel-name"` and a `limit`
  This uses `conversations.history`, which returns every
  message in the channel. Pass `limit: 0` for unlimited.
  **Always use `list_messages` for channel history**, not
  `search_messages`. Slack's search index doesn't guarantee
  returning every message; a wildcard query like `*` will
  miss messages that the indexer doesn't match.

### "Who is [person]"
→ `get_user` with `user: "person"` (handle or @handle)

### "Tell me about #channel"
→ `get_channel` with `channel: "channel-name"`

### "Send [person/channel] a message saying…"
→ `send_message` with `channel` and `text`
- The user sees a confirmation gate before it sends

### "Start a group DM with [person] and [person]"
→ `send_message` with `channel` set to comma-separated user
  IDs or @handles, and `text` for the message body.
  Examples:
  - `channel: "W018HTJBU1H,U09HTCT9YLU"`
  - `channel: "@katie.laliberte,@jonathan.feng"`

  The tool calls `conversations.open` with multiple users to
  create or find the group DM, then sends the message.
  Handles are resolved to user IDs automatically. If you
  already have user IDs from a previous `get_user` call, use
  those directly.

### "Reply to that thread saying…"
→ `reply_to_thread` with `channel`, `ts` (from previous context), and `text`

  The thread parent's timestamp goes in `ts`, not `thread_ts`.
  `reply_to_thread` reads only `ts`; it ignores `thread_ts`
  and fails with `Missing required parameter: channel + ts or
  target` when `ts` is empty. `thread_ts` exists solely for
  `get_message` of a reply inside a thread. The parameter
  name is a trap: "reply to a thread" does not mean "fill in
  thread_ts."

### "Edit that message" / "Fix that" / "Update what I said"
→ `edit_message` with `target` (or `channel`+`ts`) and the
  new `text` (and optional `table`)
- Only edits messages the authenticated user authored.
  Slack rejects edits to anyone else's messages.
- The full message text is **replaced**, not merged. Pass
  the complete new text, not just the part that changed.
- Cannot add or remove file attachments — Slack's
  `chat.update` API only changes text and blocks. If the
  user wants to swap attachments, delete the message and
  re-upload.
- The confirmation gate shows the new text exactly as it
  will appear after the edit. The user approves, rejects
  or redirects with notes — the same flow as `send_message`.
- Works on top-level messages and thread replies
  identically. Use the reply's own `ts`, not the thread
  parent's.

```
slack({ action: "edit_message", target: "https://...permalink...",
        text: "Updated draft — fixed the typo and added the link" })
```

### "Reply to that thread with these messages…" / "Send these as replies"
→ `reply_to_thread` with `channel`, `ts` and a `messages`
  array (same shape as `send_thread`)
- Use this when the user has several thoughts that belong
  on an existing thread and you want to queue them up for
  a single review pass.
- Mutually exclusive with `text`, `file_path`/`file_paths`
  and `table`. Pick one mode.
- The tabbed review gate works the same as `send_thread`:
  one tab per reply, all must be approved, any rejection
  halts everything. The role label on each tab says
  "Reply N of M" so the gate can't be confused with the
  thread-creation flow.

### "React to that with :emoji:"
→ `add_reaction` with `target` or `channel`+`ts`, and `emoji`

### "Send this file to #channel" / "Share this in #channel"
→ `upload_file` with `file_path` and `channel`
- The file path must be an absolute path or relative to the
  current working directory.
- Add `text` for an initial comment introducing the file.

### "Reply with this file attached" / "Share this in the thread"
→ `upload_file` with `file_path`, `channel`+`ts` (or
  `target`), and optionally `text`
- Thread targeting works the same as `reply_to_thread`:
  use `target` for a permalink or `channel`+`ts` for
  explicit targeting.

### "Send a message with this file" / "Message them with the report"
→ `send_message` with `text`, `channel`, and `file_path`
- When `file_path` or `file_paths` is present on
  `send_message` or `reply_to_thread`, the file gets
  uploaded and shared alongside the message text.
- This is the natural choice when the user wants both a
  message and a file attachment in a single action.

### "Upload these files" / "Share all of these"
→ `upload_file` with `file_paths` (array) and `channel`
- Multiple files are uploaded individually and shared
  together in a single message.
- `file_path` (singular) and `file_paths` (array) can be
  combined; duplicates are ignored.

### "Post a thread about X" / "Send these as a thread"
→ `send_thread` with `channel` and `messages` array
- The first message becomes the thread parent; the rest
  become replies in order.
- Each message object has `text` and optional `file_path`
  / `file_paths` for attachments.
- A tabbed review gate shows every message for approval
  before anything is sent. Rejecting or redirecting any
  single message halts the entire thread and nothing is
  sent.
- When the user rejects or steers a message, their note
  tells you what to change. Rewrite the affected
  message(s) based on their feedback and resubmit the
  full `messages` array. Don't drop the rejected message;
  fix it. Don't resend only the rejected one; the whole
  thread must be reviewed together.
- Every message must be reviewed. If the user submits
  early (Ctrl+Enter) without reviewing all tabs, the
  gate rejects with a note asking them to review
  everything.
- The same `messages` array works on `reply_to_thread`
  when the user wants to queue several replies on an
  existing thread instead of starting a new one. See
  the "Reply to that thread with these messages" entry
  above.

```
slack({ action: "send_thread", channel: "#team-updates",
        messages: [
          { text: "Weekly update for the team" },
          { text: "Progress: shipped the new dashboard" },
          { text: "Blockers: waiting on API access" }
        ] })
```

### Ambiguous Date Ranges

When the user says "last 3 months", "recently" or "this
quarter", state the exact date range you're using (e.g.,
"Searching from December 27 to today") so the user can
correct it if it doesn't match their intent.

### "Messages I reacted to" / "Where did I react"
→ Multiple `search_messages` calls, one per common emoji.
  Use `hasmy::thumbsup:`, `hasmy::heart:`, `hasmy::fire:`,
  etc. as the query. See "Enterprise Grid Limitations" for
  the full approach.
  **Do not** try `hasmy:reaction` — it returns nothing.

## Search Operators

Slack search supports these operators embedded in the `query`:
- `from:username` — messages from a person
- `to:username` — direct messages to a person
- `with:@person` — DMs and threads with a specific person
  (also available as the `with` parameter)
- `in:#channel` — messages in a channel
- `has:reaction` — messages that have **any** reaction on them
  (from anyone). Does NOT mean "messages I reacted to."
- `has:link` / `has:pin` — message properties
- `hasmy::thumbsup:` — messages **you** reacted to with a
  **specific** emoji. There is no wildcard form: `hasmy:reaction`
  does NOT work. You must name the exact emoji.
  Do not confuse with `has:reaction` which is unrelated.
- `is:thread` — only thread messages
- `is:saved` — your saved items
- `after:YYYY-MM-DD` / `before:YYYY-MM-DD` — date range.
  **These are exclusive**: `after:2026-03-26` means messages
  from March 27 onward, not from March 26. To include today,
  use yesterday's date.
- `on:YYYY-MM-DD` — exact date
- `during:month` / `during:year` — relative dates (e.g. `during:march`)
- `"exact phrase"` — quoted exact phrase match
- `term -excluded` — exclude results containing a word
- `rep*` — wildcard prefix match (min 3 characters)

Structured parameters (`from`, `with`, `channel`, `after`,
`before`) get appended as operators to the query string.

**No "starts with" operator**: Slack search matches a phrase
anywhere in the message body, not just at the start. When
the user asks for messages starting with a phrase, search
for that phrase and tell the user that results include any
message containing it. Post-filtering on returned text is
approximate since message text in results may be truncated.

## URL and ID Handling

All identifier formats are resolved automatically:

- **Permalink URLs**: pass as `target` — works for any
  message-targeting action (`get_message`, `get_thread`,
  `get_reactions`, `reply_to_thread`, `add_reaction`,
  `remove_reaction`).
- **Channel + ts**: pass as `channel` + `ts` — works for
  the same actions. Equivalent to using a permalink.
- **Channel names**: with or without `#`. Resolved to the
  conversation automatically.
- **User IDs as channel**: resolves to the DM conversation
  automatically via `conversations.open`.
- **Comma-separated user IDs or @handles**: resolves to a
  group DM via `conversations.open` with multiple users.
- **User handles**: with or without `@`. Resolved to user
  IDs automatically.
- **Timestamps**: the `ts` field from previous results.

## Context Management

### Remember Previous Results

After `search_messages`, remember the message list. The user
may say:
- "Show me the thread for the first one" → use the permalink
  or channel + ts from the result
- "What's the context for that third message" → get_thread
- "Reply to that" → use channel + ts from the message

After `list_messages` in a channel, the user may say:
- "What's that thread about" → get_thread with channel + ts
- "Send a reply" → reply_to_thread

After `get_user`, the user may ask:
- "Send them a message" → use the user ID as channel

### Thread Navigation

The most common follow-up after a search is reading a thread.
When results show messages with thread context, proactively
mention that threads are available.

## File Attachments

Slack messages can carry file attachments: images,
screenshots, code snippets, JSON configs, etc. The tool
automatically downloads and exposes file content for
targeted fetches (`get_message` and `get_thread`).

**Images** (png, jpeg, gif, webp) are downloaded and
returned as image content the model can see directly.

**Text files** (`text/*` types plus json, xml, yaml,
javascript, typescript, sh, sql, graphql, toml) are
downloaded and returned as text content.

**Other file types** are not downloaded but their URLs
are rendered as markdown links (`📄 [name](url)`) so
the user can access them manually.

**Bulk fetches** (`list_messages`, `search_messages`)
don't auto-download files — they show file references
with URLs. Use `get_message` to download a specific
file on demand.

Limits: max 10 files per request, 5 MB per image,
128 KB per text file. Oversized or inaccessible files
are skipped silently; the filename still appears in
the rendered text.

## Response Formatting

When presenting results to the user:

1. **Lead with a summary**: "Found 5 messages from you to
   Chao Duan, all from yesterday evening."
2. **Highlight the substance**: what topics, decisions, or
   requests appear in the messages.
3. **Offer next steps**: "Want me to pull up the full thread
   for any of these?" or "Should I reply to that?"

Don't re-list every message — the tool output already shows
them. Add interpretation and context the raw output doesn't
provide.

## Pagination

The tool auto-paginates internally for `search_messages`,
`search_files` and `list_messages`. You don't need to manage
pages yourself; just set the `limit` parameter and the tool
fetches as many pages as needed.

- **Default limit**: 20 results. Fine for quick lookups.
- **"Show me all"**: pass `limit: 0` for unlimited results.
- **Specific count**: pass any number. `limit: 1000` fetches
  up to 1000, paging through internally.

**When the user asks a question that requires comprehensive
data** (e.g. "how many times did I…", "find all messages
about…", "what did I say over the past N months"), **always
pass `limit: 0`** with appropriate `oldest`/`latest` params.
The default limit of 20 is useless for these queries. Drawing
conclusions from partial data is worse than fetching too much.

For search results, when the total exceeds what was fetched,
the output says so. Relay this to the user and offer to fetch
the rest with a higher limit.

## Efficiency: Minimise Tool Calls

The Slack API has no "top DM partners" or "most active
channels" endpoint. Complex questions require creative
querying. Aim to extract maximum information from each call.

**Use `list_messages` for DM history**: pass the person's
user ID as the `channel` — it resolves to the DM
automatically via `conversations.open`. This returns only
DM messages, complete and in order. Use `with:` on
`search_messages` only when you need keyword filtering
across DMs *and* shared channels.

**Batch over serial**: a single `search_messages` with 100
results gives you conversation metadata, user IDs,
timestamps and text. Extract patterns from that data before
making more calls. Don't look up each user or channel
individually unless you need details beyond what the search
gave you.

**User mentions are auto-resolved**: the tool resolves raw
Slack user IDs (U08ME9KASG7) to @handles automatically,
both in message author fields and in message text mentions.
You don't need to call `get_user` just to learn someone's
name — it already appears in message output.

**Conversation types are resolved automatically**: each
message includes conversation metadata with a `displayName`
and `kind`. Kinds are `dm` (1:1 direct message), `group_dm`
(multi-person DM), or `channel` (public or private channel).
Use these to filter results instead of guessing from ID
prefixes.

**Use search operators aggressively**: combine operators to
narrow results. `from:me with:@person after:2025-03-01` is
far more efficient than broad searches filtered after the
fact.

**For "who do I DM most"**: search `from:me` with a high
limit. Each result has a conversation `kind` of `dm`,
`group_dm` or `channel`. Filter to `dm` and `group_dm`
entries and count by conversation to rank DM partners.
Display names show who the DM is with (e.g. "@chao.duan"
or "@chao.duan, @xiao.li, @henrique.andrade").

## Enterprise Grid Limitations

Some Slack APIs are blocked on enterprise workspaces even
with browser session tokens:

- **`reactions.list`**: blocked (`not_allowed_token_type`).
  Cannot list all messages a user reacted to.
- **`users.conversations`**: blocked (`enterprise_is_restricted`).
  Cannot list DM channels or group DMs.
- **`conversations.list`**: blocked. Cannot enumerate channels.

These limitations mean some queries require creative
workarounds through search. Never fall back to raw shell
commands or curl — always use the tool's search actions.

### "Messages I reacted to" / "Where did I react"

The `hasmy::emoji:` operator requires a specific emoji name.
There is no wildcard. Search common emojis individually:

```
hasmy::thumbsup: after:2025-03-20
hasmy::heart: after:2025-03-20
hasmy::fire: after:2025-03-20
hasmy::joy: after:2025-03-20
hasmy::raised_hands: after:2025-03-20
hasmy::tada: after:2025-03-20
hasmy::100: after:2025-03-20
```

Run multiple `search_messages` calls with these queries.
Deduplicate across results and filter by conversation `kind`
if the user asks about DMs specifically.

**Warn the user** that this only covers common emojis. Custom
or unusual reactions may be missed.

## Message Formatting

The tool accepts a hybrid of Slack mrkdwn and standard
markdown and converts the message to Block Kit before
sending. Both spellings of bold, italic, strikethrough and
links are accepted. Lists, headings, dividers, blockquotes
and code blocks render natively. Not all markdown features
translate — see "Unsupported Syntax" below for what to
never include.

### Text Formatting
- **Bold**: `*text*` or `**text**`
- **Italic**: `_text_`
- **Strikethrough**: `~text~` or `~~text~~`
- **Inline code**: `` `code` ``
- **Code block**: triple backticks on their own lines.
  No language hints — Slack ignores them.

### Structure
- **Headings**: `# Title`, `## Subtitle`, etc. Slack only
  has one heading style, so all levels render the same
  (large bold text). The tool emits a Block Kit `header`
  block.
- **Dividers**: a line containing only `---`, `***` or
  `___` becomes a horizontal rule (Block Kit `divider`).
- **Bulleted lists**: start each line with `- `, `* ` or
  `+ ` (a marker then a space). The tool converts consecutive
  bullet lines into a native Slack `rich_text_list` block, so
  wrapped lines indent correctly. Never use a `•`, `‣`, `◦`,
  `▪`, `·` or any other manual bullet glyph: Slack renders those
  as literal characters, not a list, and they defeat the native
  list block. Markdown markers only.
- **Ordered lists**: start each line with `1. `, `2. ` and
  so on. Slack always renumbers from 1 regardless of the
  digits you write — the digits are just a marker.
- **Nested lists**: indent sub-items by two spaces (or one
  tab) per level. Mixing bullet and ordered styles or
  changing indent starts a new list block.
- **Blockquotes**: start each line with `> `. Consecutive
  quote lines become a single `rich_text_quote` block.
- **Line breaks**: newlines inside a paragraph are
  preserved. A blank line between paragraphs (or between a
  paragraph and a list/quote/code) renders as visible
  vertical space.

### Links and Mentions
- **Links**: `[display text](https://example.com)` or
  Slack's native `<https://example.com|display text>` —
  both work. Bare URLs (`https://example.com`) auto-link.
- **User mentions**: write `@first.last` and the tool
  resolves the handle to a user ID. `<@U12345>` is also
  accepted.
- **Channel mentions**: `<#C12345>` with the channel ID.

### Avoiding Auto-Detected Colour Swatches

Slack auto-renders any `#` followed by 3, 4, 6 or 8 hex
digits as a colour swatch — which catches PR numbers like
`#675891`. The tool defends against this automatically by
splitting the `#` and the digits across two adjacent text
elements, so the rendered output looks identical but the
swatch detector doesn't fire. No special syntax needed.

### Unsupported Syntax (Never Use)

These render as raw text or break formatting. Never include
them in Slack messages:

- ` ```python ` — language hints are ignored. Use bare
  triple backticks with no language identifier.
- `![alt](image-url)` — image embedding does not exist.
  Upload images with `file_path` instead.
- `| col | col |` — pipe tables render as broken
  plaintext. Always use the `table` parameter for
  tabular data (see Tables below).

## Tables

**Always use the `table` parameter for tabular data.** Never
format tables as pipe-delimited markdown in the `text`
field — Slack renders pipe tables as broken plaintext.

Tables appear in received messages (rendered as pipe tables
in tool output for readability) and are sent using the
`table` parameter on `send_message`, `reply_to_thread` or
individual `send_thread` messages.

### Reading Tables

When a message contains a Slack table block, the tool
renders it as a pipe-delimited markdown table in the
output. Bold text appears as `**text**`, links as
`[text](url)`, mentions as `@handle` — the same format
as regular message text.

### Sending Tables

Use the `table` parameter on `send_message`,
`reply_to_thread`, or individual `send_thread` messages.

```
slack({
  action: "send_message",
  channel: "#ops",
  text: "Outstanding issues by director:",
  table: {
    columns: ["Director", "Issue Count"],
    rows: [
      ["*Patrick Burke*", "3"],
      ["<https://github.com/org/repo/pulls|Andrew McNamara>", "2"],
      ["Brad Wright", "2"]
    ],
    column_settings: [null, { align: "right" }]
  }
})
```

**Cell formatting**: cells are mrkdwn strings — the same
formatting as message text. Use `*bold*`, `_italic_`,
`~strike~`, `` `code` ``, `<url|text>` for links, and
`@handle` for mentions. Cells without formatting are sent
as plain text.

**Column settings**: optional per-column display settings.
Each entry can have:
- `align`: `"left"` (default), `"center"`, or `"right"`
- `is_wrapped`: `true` to wrap text instead of truncating

Use `null` to skip a column and keep defaults.

**Notification fallback**: the `text` field becomes the
notification preview when a table is present. If `text`
is omitted, a fallback like "Table with N rows" is
generated.

**Constraints**:
- 1 table per message (Slack limit)
- Max 100 rows, 20 columns
- Each row must have the same number of cells as there
  are columns

### "Send a table showing…" / "Post this data as a table"
→ `send_message` with `table: { columns, rows }`
- Tables render as native Slack table blocks (not ASCII art
  or code blocks)
- A confirmation gate shows a box-drawing preview of the
  table before sending

## Uploading Files

The `upload_file` action uploads local files to Slack using
the V2 external upload API. Files can also be attached to
`send_message` and `reply_to_thread` by adding `file_path`
or `file_paths` to the call.

### When to Use Which

**File only (no message text):**
```
slack({ action: "upload_file", channel: "team-updates",
        file_path: "/path/to/report.pdf" })
```

**File with an introductory comment:**
```
slack({ action: "upload_file", channel: "team-updates",
        file_path: "/path/to/report.pdf",
        text: "Here's the weekly report" })
```

**Message with file attachment:**
```
slack({ action: "send_message", channel: "team-updates",
        text: "Here's the weekly report",
        file_path: "/path/to/report.pdf" })
```
The `send_message` and `reply_to_thread` approach is the
natural choice when the user's intent is "send a message
with an attachment."

**Thread reply with file:**
```
slack({ action: "reply_to_thread", channel: "C0AJY0FLK8Q",
        ts: "1743044006.509399",
        text: "Updated version attached",
        file_path: "/path/to/updated.png" })
```
Alternatively, use `upload_file` with `target` or
`channel`+`ts` for thread targeting.

**Multiple files:**
```
slack({ action: "upload_file", channel: "design-reviews",
        file_paths: ["/path/to/mockup-v1.png",
                     "/path/to/mockup-v2.png"],
        text: "Two options for the new layout" })
```
`file_path` and `file_paths` can be combined; duplicates
are ignored.

### File Path Resolution

File paths must be absolute or relative to the current
working directory. The tool reads the file from disk and
uploads the raw bytes to Slack. It supports any file type:
images, PDFs, code files, documents and anything else Slack
accepts.

**Thread messages with attachments:**
```
slack({ action: "send_thread", channel: "design-reviews",
        messages: [
          { text: "Two layout options for review" },
          { text: "Option A",
            file_path: "/path/to/mockup-v1.png" },
          { text: "Option B",
            file_path: "/path/to/mockup-v2.png" }
        ] })
```
Each message in a `send_thread` call can have its own
attachments. Files are uploaded into the thread after
each message is sent.

### Confirmation Gate

All file uploads show a confirmation gate before uploading.
The gate displays file names, sizes and the destination
channel or thread. The user can approve, reject or redirect.

`send_thread` uses a tabbed confirmation gate: one tab per
message showing the text and any attached files. All
messages must be approved before anything is sent. If the
user rejects or steers any message, the entire thread is
halted. Rewrite the affected message(s) based on the
user's feedback and resubmit the full array.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**DON'T** just echo "here are the results":
```
# ❌ Bad
"Here are your last 5 messages to Chao Duan."

# ✅ Good
"Your recent conversation with Chao Duan (yesterday evening)
was about M5 risk areas — you offered to help triage issues
and mentioned having a call scheduled. Want me to pull up
the full thread?"
```

**DON'T** forget context from previous results:
```
# ❌ Bad: asking for a URL the results already provided
"What's the thread URL?"

# ✅ Good: use the permalink or channel + ts from the result
slack({ action: "get_thread", target: "https://...permalink..." })
slack({ action: "get_thread", channel: "C0AJY0FLK8Q", ts: "1743044006.509399" })
```

**DON'T** fabricate or guess Slack timestamps:
```
# ❌ Bad: inventing a timestamp that looks plausible
slack({ action: "get_thread", channel: "C0AJY0FLK8Q", ts: "1776349731.307559" })

# ✅ Good: use the (ts:...) value from a previous result
# Result showed: **@user** Apr 16, 10:02 AM (ts:1776348171.653739) [6 replies]
slack({ action: "get_thread", channel: "C0AJY0FLK8Q", ts: "1776348171.653739" })
```

**DON'T** pass raw user IDs when the user gave a name:
```
# ❌ Bad
slack({ action: "get_user", user: "U08ME9KASG7" })

# ✅ Good
slack({ action: "get_user", user: "joel.gerber" })
```

**DON'T** fall back to raw curl or shell commands when an API
is blocked. Use the tool's search actions creatively instead.
The user should never see curl scripts in the output.

**DON'T** use `search_messages` to get channel history:
```
# ❌ Bad: search index doesn't return all messages
slack({ action: "search_messages", query: "*",
        channel: "privacy-engineering", limit: 1000 })

# ✅ Good: conversations.history returns every message
slack({ action: "list_messages",
        channel: "privacy-engineering", limit: 1000 })
```

**DON'T** use `search_messages` to search DMs:
```
# ❌ Bad: search can't target DM conversations
slack({ action: "search_messages", channel: "U093FQUHEJG" })

# ✅ Good: list_messages resolves user IDs to DMs
slack({ action: "list_messages", channel: "U093FQUHEJG" })
```

**DON'T** patch an edit by appending only the change:
```
# ❌ Bad: chat.update replaces the entire message
slack({ action: "edit_message", target: "...",
        text: "(typo fix)" })

# ✅ Good: send the full new message text
slack({ action: "edit_message", target: "...",
        text: "Here's the report — fixed the table totals." })
```

**DON'T** try to swap attachments via `edit_message`:
```
# ❌ Bad: chat.update can't change attachments
slack({ action: "edit_message", target: "...",
        text: "updated", file_path: "/new/file.png" })

# ✅ Good: delete and re-upload, or post a follow-up reply
# explaining the change.
```

**DON'T** format tabular data as markdown in the text field:
```
# ❌ Bad: pipe tables render as broken plaintext in Slack
slack({ action: "send_message", channel: "#ops",
        text: "| Name | Count |\n|------|-------|\n| Alice | 3 |" })

# ✅ Good: use the table parameter for native Block Kit tables
slack({ action: "send_message", channel: "#ops",
        text: "Outstanding issues:",
        table: { columns: ["Name", "Count"],
                 rows: [["Alice", "3"]] } })
```

**DON'T** try non-existent search operators:
```
# ❌ These don't exist
hasmy:reaction
has:myreaction

# ✅ Must name a specific emoji
hasmy::thumbsup:
hasmy::heart:
```

**DON'T** put the thread parent's ts in `thread_ts` when
replying. `reply_to_thread` reads only `ts`:
```
# ❌ Bad: fails with "Missing required parameter: channel + ts or target"
slack({ action: "reply_to_thread", channel: "C0AJY0FLK8Q",
        thread_ts: "1781112262.653269", text: "..." })

# ✅ Good: the parent ts goes in ts
slack({ action: "reply_to_thread", channel: "C0AJY0FLK8Q",
        ts: "1781112262.653269", text: "..." })
```

**DON'T** use `•` or other glyph bullets for lists. They
render as literal text, not a Slack list:
```
# ❌ Bad: • is a literal character, not a list marker
slack({ action: "send_message", channel: "#ops",
        text: "• Safe: gt restack\n• Not safe: gt get" })

# ✅ Good: markdown markers become a native rich_text_list
slack({ action: "send_message", channel: "#ops",
        text: "- Safe: gt restack\n- Not safe: gt get" })
```
