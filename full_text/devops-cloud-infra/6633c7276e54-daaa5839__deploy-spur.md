description: Use when the user asks to deploy/install a Spur cluster, or roll out a new build to an already-running one, on one or more bare-metal hosts over SSH. Covers every topology the Ansible playbook does — single-node, multi-node, HA (multi-controller Raft), and HA with separate compute nodes — plus optional PostgreSQL accounting (embedded in spurctld) and WireGuard mesh. Installs daemons as systemd services and Slurm-compatible CLI symlinks. Drives everything with plain SSH + bash; no Ansible required. ALWAYS asks the user up-front for mode + topology + controller count + accounting before touching anything.

# Deploy Spur Cluster

Spur is an AI-native job scheduler with these daemons:

- **spurctld** — controller / scheduler / Raft consensus (1 instance, or ≥ 3 for HA). Also serves accounting (sacct/fairshare, backed by PostgreSQL) in-process on its own gRPC port whenever `[accounting].database_url` is set — there is no separate accounting daemon. Only Postgres itself is a distinct service, on `ACCT_HOST` (default: first controller; may be a dedicated node).
- **spurd** — node agent, runs on every compute host

> Pre-merge Spur builds additionally shipped a standalone `spurdbd` accounting daemon; upstream folded it into `spurctld`. If you're upgrading a cluster that still has `spurdbd.service` active, see **Step 5b: migrating off a standalone spurdbd** below — don't skip it, or you'll end up with two accounting paths fighting over the same Postgres.

This skill stands a cluster up with only SSH + bash on the targets. It is the standalone equivalent of `ansible/` and reaches the same end state: daemons run as **systemd services** (survive reboot), Slurm-compatible CLI names are symlinked, and accounting is optional (default on). One flow covers all four topologies — only the host list, Raft topology, and which hosts run an agent differ. A rolling-upgrade flow (Step 12) upgrades an already-running cluster one host at a time instead of bouncing everything at once.

Defaults (override only if the user asks):

| Var | Default |
|---|---|
| `SPUR_HOME` | `/root/spur` |
| `SPUR_INSTALL_DIR` | `/root/.local/bin` |
| `SPUR_VERSION` | `latest` (passed to `install.sh`; or `nightly` / `vX.Y.Z`) |
| `SPUR_BINARY_SRC` | *(empty)* — local dir with pre-built `spur/spurctld/spurd`; used when set, else `install.sh` |
| `SPUR_CONTROLLER_PORT` | `6817` |
| `SPUR_AGENT_PORT` | `6818` |
| `SPUR_RAFT_PORT` | `6821` (hardcoded inside spurctld; cannot be changed via CLI) |
| `ACCT_DB_PORT` | `5432` (PostgreSQL) |
| `SPUR_CLUSTER_NAME` | `spur-cluster` |
| `SPUR_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` |
| `SPUR_WIPE_STATE` | `false` (preserve Raft state so re-runs/upgrades are non-destructive; set `true` for a fresh install or intentional Raft reinit) |
| `ACCOUNTING` | `true` (deploy PostgreSQL; accounting is served by spurctld itself; set `false` to skip) |
| `ACCT_DB_NAME` / `ACCT_DB_USER` / `ACCT_DB_PASSWORD` | `spur` / `spur` / `spur` |
| `TRANSPORT` | `direct` (LAN) — or `wireguard` for an encrypted mesh |
| `ROLLING_BATCH_SIZE` | `1` (agents upgraded per batch in Step 12; controllers are always one at a time) |
| SSH user | `root` (unless the user specifies otherwise) |

> Every command below is written to work whether the SSH user is `root` or a non-root user with (passwordless) `sudo` — confirm `sudo -n true` succeeds during Step 1's preflight. `SPUR_HOME`/`SPUR_INSTALL_DIR` default under `/root`, which is mode `0700`: a non-root user cannot even `cd`/execute/`test -x` into it, let alone write there, and **no `chown` of a subdirectory fixes this** (the block is on traversing `/root` itself). So:
> - Every remote command that reads/writes under `/root`, `/etc/systemd/system`, or runs `spur`/`sbatch`/`sacct`/etc. must be `sudo`-prefixed — not just the file-writing steps. This applies uniformly (as root, `sudo` is a harmless no-op).
> - `scp` and heredoc redirects (`cat > /path <<EOF`) run as the plain SSH user and cannot land a file directly under `/root` even with the SSH user later `sudo`-reading it. Copy to `/tmp` first, then `sudo install`/`sudo mv` it into place.
> - Alternatively, set `SPUR_INSTALL_DIR`/`SPUR_HOME` to a world-traversable path (e.g. `/opt/spur`) up front to sidestep all of this — but then every install/`sudo` note below is still harmless, just unnecessary.
>
> **Password-based SSH works too** — every `ssh`/`scp` command in this skill is a plain invocation with no auth-method assumptions baked in, so if key-based auth isn't set up, prefix each one with `sshpass -p "$SSH_PASSWORD" ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ...` (and the `scp` equivalent). Do **not** add `-o BatchMode=yes` anywhere — it disables SSH's password prompt outright and silently breaks password auth even with `sshpass` supplying the answer.

## Step 0: gather inputs (MANDATORY — do not skip)

Before any SSH, **ask the user** (use `AskUserQuestion` for anything they didn't state; don't guess):

1. **Deployment mode** — pick exactly one:
   | Mode | Use when |
   |---|---|
   | `single-node` | one host runs controller **and** agent |
   | `multi-node` | 1 controller, N compute agents (controller may also run an agent — hyperconverged) |
   | `ha` | ≥ 3 controllers (Raft), N agents; controllers may be hyperconverged **or** dedicated (separate compute) |

2. **Hosts** — for each role:
   - `CONTROLLERS` — SSH targets running `spurctld`. Counts: single-node 1, multi-node 1, ha odd ≥ 3.
   - `AGENTS` — SSH targets running `spurd`. Any number ≥ 1. A host may appear in **both** lists (hyperconverged) or **only** in `AGENTS` (dedicated compute / "separate compute" HA).

3. **Accounting** — deploy PostgreSQL for `sacct`/fairshare (served by spurctld itself, no separate daemon)? Default **yes**. If no, set `ACCOUNTING=false`; job submission still works, only `sacct` is unavailable.

4. **Transport** — `direct` (LAN, default) or `wireguard` (encrypted mesh). WireGuard adds Step 2b; everything else is identical (config advertises WG IPs instead of LAN IPs).

> **For HA, warn the user** if controller count is even or < 3:
> - `N=1` → not HA; suggest `multi-node`.
> - `N=2` → "zero fault tolerance" (quorum 2, tolerates 0 failures) — code-path testing only.
> - even `N ≥ 4` → suggest `N−1` (strictly better).
>
> **Topologies map to inventory shape** exactly like the playbook:
> - single-node → same host in CONTROLLERS and AGENTS
> - multi-node → 1 controller, N agents
> - HA hyperconverged → controllers also in AGENTS
> - HA + separate compute → controllers **not** in AGENTS; distinct agent hosts

Once gathered, define the arrays the rest of the skill uses:
```bash
CONTROLLERS=( user@host1 user@host2 user@host3 )   # ordered — index = Raft node_id - 1; ORDER MUST BE STABLE
AGENTS=(     user@host4 )                            # may overlap CONTROLLERS (hyperconverged) or be disjoint
LOGIN=(      )                                        # OPTIONAL dedicated submission/login nodes: CLI only, no daemon. Empty = none.
SSH_USER=root
TRANSPORT=direct                                     # or wireguard
ACCOUNTING=true                                      # or false
ACCT_HOST="${CONTROLLERS[0]}"                         # accounting host: default first controller; may be ANY host — a controller, an agent, or a dedicated node (add it to HOSTS_ALL if dedicated)

SPUR_HOME=/root/spur
SPUR_INSTALL_DIR=/root/.local/bin
SPUR_VERSION=latest
SPUR_BINARY_SRC=                                     # e.g. /tmp/spur-bin to push pre-built binaries
SPUR_CONTROLLER_PORT=6817; SPUR_AGENT_PORT=6818; SPUR_RAFT_PORT=6821; ACCT_DB_PORT=5432
SPUR_CLUSTER_NAME=spur-cluster; SPUR_LOG_LEVEL=info; SPUR_WIPE_STATE=false
ACCT_DB_NAME=spur; ACCT_DB_USER=spur; ACCT_DB_PASSWORD=spur
ROLLING_BATCH_SIZE=1                                  # Step 12 only — agents upgraded per batch

HOSTS_ALL=( $(printf '%s\n' "${CONTROLLERS[@]}" "${AGENTS[@]}" "${LOGIN[@]}" | sort -u) )
ha_enabled=false; [ ${#CONTROLLERS[@]} -gt 1 ] && ha_enabled=true
```

## Step 1: preflight all hosts

Run on every unique host. Abort the whole deploy on any failure.

```bash
for tgt in "${HOSTS_ALL[@]}"; do
  echo "############ $tgt ############"
  ssh -o ConnectTimeout=10 "$tgt" '
    set +e
    echo "host=$(hostname -s) fqdn=$(hostname -f)"
    echo "kernel=$(uname -r) nproc=$(nproc)"
    echo "--- spur ports (6817/6818/6821) ---"
    ss -tlnpH 2>/dev/null | grep -E ":(6817|6818|6821)\b" || echo "spur ports free"
    echo "--- existing spur pids ---"
    pgrep -ax spurctld; pgrep -ax spurd; pgrep -ax spurdbd; echo "(end pids)"
    echo "--- tools ---"
    for t in curl tar bash ss pgrep pkill systemctl; do command -v $t >/dev/null || echo "MISSING:$t"; done
    echo "--- sudo ---"; sudo -n true 2>/dev/null && echo "sudo:ok" || echo "sudo:NEEDS-PASSWORD"
    echo "--- ip ---"
    ip -4 -o addr show | awk "{print \$2, \$4}" | grep -v "127.0.0.1"
    echo "--- os ---"
    . /etc/os-release 2>/dev/null && echo "$PRETTY_NAME"
  '
done
```

Fail-fast rules:
- A spur port held by a process that is NOT `spurctld`/`spurd`/`spurdbd` → abort.
- `MISSING:systemctl` → abort (this skill installs systemd units; systemd is required).
- `MISSING:curl`/`tar` → abort unless `SPUR_BINARY_SRC` is set (installer needs them; the binary-copy path does not).
- SSH fails → abort that host; fix auth first.

(Existing spur daemons are fine — Step 4 stops them.)

## Step 2: install Spur binaries on all hosts (idempotent)

Two sources, same as the playbook. ROCm/spur publishes releases (https://github.com/ROCm/spur/releases) — `install.sh` (no `SPUR_BINARY_SRC` set) downloads one automatically (`SPUR_VERSION=latest` by default, or `nightly` for a mainline build, or a specific `vX.Y.Z`). Set `SPUR_BINARY_SRC` to a local dir holding pre-built `spur`, `spurctld`, `spurd` instead when you need mainline changes not yet released, an air-gapped install, or a custom build.

```bash
for tgt in "${HOSTS_ALL[@]}"; do
  ssh "$tgt" "
    set -euo pipefail
    sudo mkdir -p ${SPUR_HOME} ${SPUR_HOME}/state ${SPUR_HOME}/log ${SPUR_HOME}/etc ${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR}
  "
  if [ -n "$SPUR_BINARY_SRC" ]; then
    # Push pre-built binaries from the operator box. scp can't land a file directly under
    # /root (it runs as the plain SSH user), so stage in /tmp and sudo-install from there.
    for b in spur spurctld spurd; do
      scp -q "${SPUR_BINARY_SRC}/${b}" "${tgt}:/tmp/${b}.spur-push"
      ssh "$tgt" "sudo install -m 0755 /tmp/${b}.spur-push ${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR}/${b} && rm -f /tmp/${b}.spur-push"
    done
  else
    ssh "$tgt" "
      set -euo pipefail
      if ! sudo test -x ${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR}/spur; then
        curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROCm/spur/main/install.sh \
          | sudo INSTALL_DIR=${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR} bash -s -- ${SPUR_VERSION}
      fi
    "
  fi
  # Verify + create Slurm-compatible symlinks (the single `spur` binary dispatches on argv[0]).
  ssh "$tgt" "
    set -euo pipefail
    sudo test -x ${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR}/spur || { echo 'spur binary missing after install' >&2; exit 1; }
    for n in sbatch squeue sinfo scancel sacct sacctmgr scontrol salloc srun sattach scrontab sdiag smd sprio sreport sshare sstat strigger; do
      sudo ln -sf ${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR}/spur ${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR}/\$n
    done
    echo 'spur installed + symlinks created'
  "
done
```

> Do NOT rely on `spur --version` — it is not a supported flag and errors. Check for the file with `test -x` instead.

Optional: prepend `${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR}` to `/etc/environment` so non-interactive SSH gets `spur`/`sbatch`/etc. on PATH.

### Step 2b: WireGuard mesh (only when `TRANSPORT=wireguard`)

Skip entirely for `direct`. WireGuard uses the built-in `spur net` CLI and is **single-controller only** — `spur net init` auto-assigns the controller `.1` and there is no multi-controller mesh command, so HA must use `direct`. Steps, using the real CLI (all `spur net` commands log to stderr):

1. `apt install wireguard-tools` on every host.
2. On the controller: `spur net init --cidr 10.44.0.0/16 --port 51820 --interface spur0` (auto-assigns `.1`). Read its pubkey with `wg show spur0 public-key` (there is **no** `spur net pubkey`).
3. On each agent (assign `.2`, `.3`, …): `spur net join --endpoint <ctl-ip>:51820 --server-key <ctl-pubkey> --address 10.44.0.<N> --prefix-len 16 --interface spur0`. `--prefix-len` **must match the CIDR** (defaults to 16). Read the agent pubkey with `wg show spur0 public-key`.
4. On the controller, register each agent: `spur net add-peer --key <agent-pubkey> --allowed-ip 10.44.0.<N>/32 --interface spur0`.

Then set `WG_IP[$host]` per host and use those in place of `IP[...]` for `[controller].hosts`, `peers`, and spurd `--address`/`--controller`. There is no `spur net down` — tear down with `wg-quick down spur0` (or `ip link del spur0`) and remove `/etc/wireguard/spur0.conf`. If the user wants WG but you cannot verify mesh connectivity (all hosts on one `/24` makes it moot), tell them and offer `direct` instead.

## Step 3: derive per-host facts (hostnames, IPs, node_ids)

```bash
host_short() { ssh "$1" 'hostname -s'; }
host_addr()  { local t="${1#*@}"; echo "$t"; }   # SSH target IP/host, minus user@

declare -A SHORT IP NODE_ID
for h in "${HOSTS_ALL[@]}"; do
  SHORT[$h]=$(host_short "$h")
  IP[$h]=$(host_addr "$h")          # for TRANSPORT=wireguard, set IP[$h]=${WG_IP[$h]} instead
done

# 1-based Raft node_id = position in CONTROLLERS. ORDER MATTERS — reordering after a
# deploy breaks openraft membership. To re-order, wipe state on every controller and redeploy.
for i in "${!CONTROLLERS[@]}"; do NODE_ID[${CONTROLLERS[$i]}]=$((i+1)); done
```

`hostname -s` (not `-f`) is intentional — the controller's `[[nodes]]` names, `spurd --hostname`, and `spur show node <name>` must all use the same short form.

## Step 4: stop existing daemons + wipe state

Stop via systemd if a unit exists, and belt-and-suspenders `pkill -x` (exact name — `pkill -f spurd` also kills `spurctld`).

```bash
for tgt in "${HOSTS_ALL[@]}"; do
  ssh "$tgt" '
    for svc in spurd spurctld spurdbd; do
      sudo systemctl stop "$svc" 2>/dev/null || true
    done
    sudo pkill -x spurd 2>/dev/null || true
    sudo pkill -x spurctld 2>/dev/null || true
    sudo pkill -x spurdbd 2>/dev/null || true
    for i in $(seq 1 10); do
      pgrep -x spurctld >/dev/null || pgrep -x spurd >/dev/null || pgrep -x spurdbd >/dev/null || exit 0
      sleep 0.5
    done
    echo "daemons still running after 5s" >&2; exit 1
  '
done

# Wipe Raft state on controllers BEFORE start (so spurctld does not rewrite the log we delete).
if [ "$SPUR_WIPE_STATE" = true ]; then
  for tgt in "${CONTROLLERS[@]}"; do
    ssh "$tgt" "sudo rm -rf ${SPUR_HOME}/state && sudo mkdir -p ${SPUR_HOME}/state"
  done
fi
```

Default is **no wipe** so re-runs and upgrades preserve the job queue and node registrations. Wipe only for a fresh install or an intentional Raft reinit. Because Spur 0.3.0 has no online Raft membership change, **changing the controller set (add/remove/reorder) requires a wipe** — if you're keeping state but the controller list differs from the running cluster, warn the user and require `SPUR_WIPE_STATE=true`. Compute agents are not Raft members and can be added/removed freely without a wipe. When demoting a host from controller to agent-only, `systemctl disable --now spurctld` on it first, or the stale daemon keeps the old membership and can block quorum.

## Step 5: deploy accounting (only when `ACCOUNTING=true`) — on `ACCT_HOST`

Accounting is served in-process by every controller's `spurctld` (no separate daemon); only Postgres is a distinct service, and it lives on `ACCT_HOST` (default `CONTROLLERS[0]`, but may be any host — a controller, an agent, or a dedicated node). Deploy it **before** the controllers so Postgres is reachable when spurctld's embedded accounting service connects. Idempotent: existence-checked role/DB creation.

Because every controller — not just `ACCT_HOST` — connects to this Postgres directly over the network, it must accept remote TCP connections, not just localhost:

```bash
# pg_hba lines granting each controller's IP access to the spur DB — built locally,
# same pattern as the [[nodes]] blocks / CSVs in Step 6. Each is its own dedup-append
# statement (grep -qxF before appending) so re-running Step 5 doesn't pile up duplicate
# lines the way a bare `tee -a` would — mirrors Ansible's lineinfile exact-match semantics.
#
# pg_hba.conf's address field is a literal IP/CIDR, not a hostname, so this can't just
# reuse IP[$h] — CONTROLLERS[] entries are SSH targets and may legitimately be DNS
# names (host_addr() in Step 3 doesn't resolve them, it only strips user@). Appending
# "somehost.example.com/32" produces an unparseable pg_hba line and takes Postgres
# down on the next restart. Ask each controller for its own real IP instead — this is
# also the more correct choice regardless of hostnames: it's the address Postgres will
# actually see as the connection's source, which may differ from whatever address SSH
# uses to reach the host (a management VLAN, a NAT'd address, etc.).
pg_hba_appends=""
for h in "${CONTROLLERS[@]}"; do
  ctl_ip=$(ssh "$h" "hostname -I | awk '{print \$1}'")
  line="host    ${ACCT_DB_NAME}    ${ACCT_DB_USER}    ${ctl_ip}/32    scram-sha-256"
  pg_hba_appends+="sudo grep -qxF '${line}' \"\$pg_hba\" || echo '${line}' | sudo tee -a \"\$pg_hba\" >/dev/null"$'\n'
done

if [ "$ACCOUNTING" = true ]; then
  ssh "$ACCT_HOST" "
    set -euo pipefail
    export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
    # Install PostgreSQL (Debian/Ubuntu). For RHEL, swap in dnf + postgresql-server + initdb.
    if ! command -v psql >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      sudo apt-get update -qq
      sudo apt-get install -y -qq postgresql postgresql-contrib
    fi
    sudo systemctl enable --now postgresql

  "
fi
```

## Step 5b: migrating off a standalone spurdbd (pre-merge upgrades only)

Skip this if the cluster has never run the old, separate `spurdbd` daemon. If it has (check `systemctl is-active spurdbd` on `ACCT_HOST`, or an `[accounting] host = ...` line in `spur.conf`), clean it up on `ACCT_HOST` — otherwise the old daemon keeps running (harmlessly, but confusingly) alongside the new embedded accounting:

```bash
ssh "$ACCT_HOST" "
  sudo systemctl disable --now spurdbd 2>/dev/null || true
  sudo rm -f /etc/systemd/system/spurdbd.service
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo rm -f ${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR}/spurdbd
"
```

The old pre-merge `spur_binary_src` push (Step 2) copied `spurdbd` to every host in `HOSTS_ALL`, not just `ACCT_HOST` — it only ever *ran* as a service on `ACCT_HOST`, but a stray unused binary can be left on other controllers/agents too. Sweep it everywhere while you're at it:

```bash
for tgt in "${HOSTS_ALL[@]}"; do
  ssh "$tgt" "sudo rm -f ${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR}/spurdbd"
done
```

Run this before (or as part of) Step 5, then proceed to Step 6 — the regenerated `spur.conf` (below) already drops the old `host = ...` key.

## Step 6: render spur.conf + install spurctld systemd unit on every controller

All controllers get the **same** `spur.conf` except `node_id` (HA only). The `peers` list order must be identical on every host (by `node_id`).

```bash
# CSVs for the controller list and the raft peers list.
ctl_hosts_csv=""; peers_csv=""
for h in "${CONTROLLERS[@]}"; do
  ctl_hosts_csv+="\"${IP[$h]}\", "
  peers_csv+="\"${IP[$h]}:${SPUR_RAFT_PORT}\", "
done
ctl_hosts_csv=${ctl_hosts_csv%, }; peers_csv=${peers_csv%, }

# Per-agent [[nodes]] blocks (90% of RAM) + partition node list.
nodes_blocks=""; part_csv=""
for h in "${AGENTS[@]}"; do
  cpus=$(ssh "$h" 'nproc')
  mem_kb=$(ssh "$h" "awk '/MemTotal/{print \$2}' /proc/meminfo")
  mem_mb=$(( mem_kb / 1024 * 9 / 10 ))
  nodes_blocks+=$'\n'"[[nodes]]"$'\n'"names = \"${SHORT[$h]}\""$'\n'"cpus = ${cpus}"$'\n'"memory_mb = ${mem_mb}"$'\n'
  part_csv+="${SHORT[$h]},"
done
part_csv=${part_csv%,}

# Accounting block (only when enabled). No separate daemon anymore — spurctld
# connects to Postgres directly, so database_url uses ACCT_HOST's network address
# (not localhost) even for a controller that happens to be ACCT_HOST itself.
# ${IP[$ACCT_HOST]} requires ACCT_HOST to be in HOSTS_ALL (Step 3); falls back to
# stripping user@ from ACCT_HOST if it wasn't resolved into the IP map.

**HA only:** spurctld binds 6817 immediately but returns `no leader elected yet` until quorum forms. Wait on the first controller:

```bash
if $ha_enabled; then
  ssh "${CONTROLLERS[0]}" "
    for i in \$(seq 1 60); do
      out=\$(sudo ${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR}/spur nodes 2>&1); rc=\$?

      # Gate on rc==0 too — a Permission denied / crash must NOT be read as 'leader up'.

      fi
      sleep 1
    done
    echo \"timeout waiting for leader: \$out\" >&2; exit 1
  "
fi
```

Set the client env on each **controller** so `squeue`/`sinfo`/`scontrol` and `sacct`/`sacctmgr`/`sreport`/`sshare` (all use `SPUR_CONTROLLER_ADDR` now — accounting rides the controller's own port, there's no separate accounting flag/env anymore) work with no per-command flags. List **every** controller, comma-separated — `spur-cli` rotates past a dead endpoint, so a controller can serve the CLI even when a different controller (or itself) is down. Controllers only (agents don't run the CLI for users here):

```bash
ctl_endpoints_csv=""
for c in "${CONTROLLERS[@]}"; do ctl_endpoints_csv+="http://${IP[$c]}:${SPUR_CONTROLLER_PORT},"; done
ctl_endpoints_csv=${ctl_endpoints_csv%,}

for ctl in "${CONTROLLERS[@]}"; do
  ssh "$ctl" "
    sudo sed -i '/^SPUR_CONTROLLER_ADDR=/d;/^SPUR_ACCOUNTING_ADDR=/d' /etc/environment
    echo 'SPUR_CONTROLLER_ADDR=${ctl_endpoints_csv}' | sudo tee -a /etc/environment >/dev/null
  "
done
```

(`/etc/environment` is read at login, so a fresh shell / `bash -lc` picks it up; for `sudo` also running the CLI, use `sudo -E` to pass the vars through. The `sed` also strips any stale `SPUR_ACCOUNTING_ADDR` left over from a pre-merge deployment of this host.)

## Step 7: install spurd systemd unit on every agent

`spurd --controller` accepts a comma-separated endpoint list and rotates past a dead one (spur-client endpoint rotation), so every agent is pointed at **every** controller, not just `CONTROLLERS[0]` — a single surviving controller is enough (followers forward writes via Raft either way). `WorkingDirectory=${SPUR_HOME}` in the unit sets the *fallback* stdout dir for `spur-<N>.out` (a job's own `WorkDir`/submit-CWD takes precedence). `--hostname`/`--address` are explicit (auto-detect picks `127.0.0.1`, breaking inter-node dispatch).

```bash
CTL_ENDPOINTS="$ctl_endpoints_csv"   # reuse the list built for the client env above
for ag in "${AGENTS[@]}"; do
  # /tmp-then-sudo-mv: a plain heredoc redirect can't write to /etc/systemd/system as a

## Step 7b: configure login (submission) nodes (only when `LOGIN` is non-empty)

A login node is a pure client: the `spur` CLI (installed in Step 2) + the controller env, **no daemon**. Users SSH in and run `sbatch`/`squeue`/`sacct`/`srun`. Just set `SPUR_CONTROLLER_ADDR` (same comma-joined controller list the controllers get in Step 6) — accounting rides that address, no separate env. Nothing else to install or start.

```bash
if [ ${#LOGIN[@]} -gt 0 ]; then
  for lg in "${LOGIN[@]}"; do
    ssh "$lg" "
      sudo sed -i '/^SPUR_CONTROLLER_ADDR=/d;/^SPUR_ACCOUNTING_ADDR=/d' /etc/environment
      echo 'SPUR_CONTROLLER_ADDR=${ctl_endpoints_csv}' | sudo tee -a /etc/environment >/dev/null
    "
  done
fi
```

> Networking: a login node needs outbound access to the controllers on `${SPUR_CONTROLLER_PORT}` (all CLI + accounting) and, for interactive `srun` live output, to the agents on `${SPUR_AGENT_PORT}` (`srun` streams output directly from the agent). Under `TRANSPORT=wireguard`, run Step 2b's join on each login node too (assign it a mesh IP and `spur net add-peer` it on the controller) so this works over the tunnel.

## Step 8: wait for every agent to register

`spur nodes` collapses by partition, so check per-agent with `spur show node`:

```bash
for ag in "${AGENTS[@]}"; do
  for i in $(seq 1 30); do
    if ssh "${CONTROLLERS[0]}" "sudo ${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR}/spur show node ${SHORT[$ag]} >/dev/null 2>&1"; then
      echo "${SHORT[$ag]} registered"; break
    fi
    [ $i -eq 30 ] && { echo "${SHORT[$ag]} never registered" >&2; exit 1; }
    sleep 1
  done
done
```

## Step 9: smoke test

### Single-node job (every deploy)

```bash
ssh "${CONTROLLERS[0]}" "
sudo rm -f /tmp/spur-test-single.sh   # a same-named file from an earlier/unrelated deploy on a
                                       # shared host can be root-owned; the plain cat> below would
                                       # then fail *silently* (no set -e here) and re-run the stale
                                       # script instead of this one.
cat > /tmp/spur-test-single.sh <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=spur-test-single
echo \"ran on \$(hostname) at \$(date)\"
EOF
chmod +x /tmp/spur-test-single.sh || { echo 'failed to write test script' >&2; exit 1; }
cd /tmp   # predictable, world-accessible WorkDir; job stdout -> /tmp/spur-<JOBID>.out. Do NOT cd into a 0700 dir like /root/spur when SSHing non-root.
jid=\$(sudo ${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR}/spur submit /tmp/spur-test-single.sh | grep -oE '[0-9]+')
echo \"JOBID=\$jid\"
for i in \$(seq 1 30); do
  st=\$(sudo ${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR}/spur show job \$jid 2>/dev/null | grep -oE 'JobState=[A-Z]+' | head -1 | cut -d= -f2)
  case \"\$st\" in COMPLETED) echo OK; break ;; FAILED|CANCELLED|TIMEOUT|NODE_FAIL) echo \"BAD: \$st\" >&2; exit 1 ;; esac
  sleep 1
done
echo \"final state: \$st\"
"
```

Output lands in `spur-<JOBID>.out` on whichever agent ran the job, in the job's `WorkDir` — i.e. the CWD at submit time (`/tmp` above). It is NOT necessarily `${SPUR_HOME}`. To locate it robustly, loop agents and search the likely dirs: `sudo find /tmp ${SPUR_HOME} /home /root -maxdepth 2 -name 'spur-<JOBID>.out'` (no shared-FS assumption; use `sudo` for non-root SSH).

### Multi-node job (when |AGENTS| ≥ 2)

`-N` must not exceed the agent count. Use `<<'EOF'` so `$SPUR_*` vars reach the agent verbatim and expand at run time; inject `N` via sed.

```bash
N=${#AGENTS[@]}
ssh "${CONTROLLERS[0]}" "
sudo rm -f /tmp/spur-test-multi.sh   # see single-node note on stale-file collisions
cat > /tmp/spur-test-multi.sh <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=spur-test-multi
#SBATCH -N __N__
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1
echo \"node \$SPUR_TASK_OFFSET of \$SPUR_NUM_NODES on \$(hostname); peers=\$SPUR_PEER_NODES\"
EOF
sed -i 's/__N__/${N}/' /tmp/spur-test-multi.sh
chmod +x /tmp/spur-test-multi.sh || { echo 'failed to write test script' >&2; exit 1; }
cd /tmp   # predictable WorkDir (see single-node note); output -> /tmp/spur-<JOBID>.out per node
jid=\$(sudo ${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR}/spur submit /tmp/spur-test-multi.sh | grep -oE '[0-9]+')
echo \"JOBID=\$jid\"
for i in \$(seq 1 60); do
  st=\$(sudo ${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR}/spur show job \$jid 2>/dev/null | grep -oE 'JobState=[A-Z]+' | head -1 | cut -d= -f2)
  case \"\$st\" in COMPLETED) echo OK; break ;; FAILED|CANCELLED|TIMEOUT|NODE_FAIL) echo \"BAD: \$st\" >&2; exit 1 ;; esac
  sleep 1
done
if [ \"\$st\" != COMPLETED ]; then
  echo \"multi-node job stuck in state '\$st' after 60s. Likely cause: a leftover per-job scratch\" >&2
  echo \"file (.spur_job_<id>.sh) in an agent's WorkDir from an earlier deploy/job-id reset that\" >&2
  echo \"can't be overwritten, so that agent rejects dispatch ('failed to write job script') and\" >&2
  echo \"the job sits in COMPLETING forever (node stays 'mix', not 'idle'). Fix: sudo cancel the\" >&2
  echo \"job (sudo ${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR}/spur cancel \$jid), sudo rm -f any stale .spur_job_*.sh in\" >&2
  echo \"/tmp on each agent, and resubmit.\" >&2
  exit 1
fi
"
# Multi-node writes locally on each node, in the job's WorkDir (here /tmp, since the submit
# above cd'd there) — NOT ${SPUR_HOME}. Fetch from every agent, checking both locations since
# WorkingDirectory=${SPUR_HOME} in the spurd unit is only a fallback if WorkDir is unavailable.
for ag in "${AGENTS[@]}"; do
  echo "=== ${SHORT[$ag]} ==="
  ssh "$ag" "sudo find /tmp ${SPUR_HOME} -maxdepth 2 -name 'spur-*.out' 2>/dev/null -exec sudo cat {} \;"
done
```

### Accounting check (when `ACCOUNTING=true`)

```bash
ssh "${CONTROLLERS[0]}" "sudo ${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR}/sacct | head"   # sacct works from any controller (accounting is served by spurctld itself)
ssh "$ACCT_HOST" "sudo -u postgres psql -d ${ACCT_DB_NAME} -tAc 'SELECT count(*) FROM jobs;'"   # postgres lives on ACCT_HOST
```
Expect a row per completed job. (With `ACCOUNTING=false`, `sacct` is expected to fail — that's fine; jobs still run.)

## Step 10: verify

```bash
ssh "${CONTROLLERS[0]}" "sudo ${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR}/spur nodes"
ssh "${CONTROLLERS[0]}" "sudo ${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR}/spur queue"

# Every daemon should be systemd-active.
for ctl in "${CONTROLLERS[@]}"; do ssh "$ctl" "systemctl is-active spurctld"; done
for ag  in "${AGENTS[@]}";      do ssh "$ag"  "systemctl is-active spurd"; done
[ "$ACCOUNTING" = true ] && ssh "$ACCT_HOST" "systemctl is-active postgresql"

# HA: identify the CURRENT leader. Every node that was ever leader has a
# 'become leader' line, so grep -m1 (first match) is wrong after any
# re-election. The authoritative current leader is in each node's persisted
# vote — read node_id from vote.json (identical on all healthy peers).
if $ha_enabled; then
  ssh "${CONTROLLERS[0]}" "sudo cat ${SPUR_HOME}/state/raft/vote.json 2>/dev/null" \
    | grep -oE '\"node_id\":[0-9]+' | tail -1 | sed 's/.*://' \
    | xargs -I{} echo "current Raft leader: node_id={}"
fi

# Separate-compute HA sanity: controllers that are NOT agents must have spurd inactive.
for ctl in "${CONTROLLERS[@]}"; do
  is_agent=false; for a in "${AGENTS[@]}"; do [ "$a" = "$ctl" ] && is_agent=true; done
  $is_agent || ssh "$ctl" "systemctl is-active spurd 2>/dev/null | grep -q inactive && echo '$ctl: no agent (correct)' || echo '$ctl: unexpected spurd'"
done
```

## Step 11: teardown (only when asked)

```bash
for tgt in "${HOSTS_ALL[@]}"; do
  ssh "$tgt" "
    for svc in spurd spurctld spurdbd; do sudo systemctl disable --now \$svc 2>/dev/null || true; done
    sudo pkill -x spurd 2>/dev/null; sudo pkill -x spurctld 2>/dev/null; sudo pkill -x spurdbd 2>/dev/null
    sudo rm -f /etc/systemd/system/spurd.service /etc/systemd/system/spurctld.service /etc/systemd/system/spurdbd.service
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload 2>/dev/null || true
    sudo rm -rf ${SPUR_HOME}
    sudo rm -f /root/spur-*.out ${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR}/spur-*.out /tmp/spur-*.out
  "
done
```

To also remove accounting data (destructive): `ssh "$ACCT_HOST" "sudo -u postgres dropdb ${ACCT_DB_NAME}; sudo -u postgres dropuser ${ACCT_DB_USER}"`. Only do this if the user explicitly asks — it deletes all job history. Leave PostgreSQL itself installed unless asked to purge it.

## Step 12: rolling upgrade (only when asked to upgrade a live cluster)

Use this instead of re-running Steps 1–9 when jobs are currently running and a full-cluster daemon bounce (which Steps 1-9 do — no draining, no batching) is not acceptable. Assumes the cluster is already up and healthy; refuse to proceed otherwise. Requires `SPUR_BINARY_SRC` pointing at the new build (rebuild all three binaries together — same caveat as any upgrade). Only exercised so far with `TRANSPORT=direct`; the `IP[]` map this step reuses from Step 3 still needs to hold real addresses (`WG_IP[]` per Step 2b) for a wireguard cluster — re-derive it in this shell session first if it isn't already populated.

**This step only pushes new binaries and restarts daemons — it does not touch `spur.conf` or Postgres.** If the cluster is still on the pre-merge standalone-`spurdbd` architecture, do the Step 5b migration first (a full-flow, bounce-based operation: Steps 2/4/5b/5/6/7/8/9/10) and confirm it's healthy on the merged-accounting build *before* using this step for further low-disruption upgrades. Running this step against a still-unmigrated cluster would push a spurctld binary that expects the new embedded-accounting config shape without updating `spur.conf`/`pg_hba.conf` to match — don't do that.

```bash
# Guard rail: refuse a rolling upgrade if state would be wiped, or the cluster
# isn't already healthy.
[ "$SPUR_WIPE_STATE" = true ] && { echo "rolling upgrade must not wipe Raft state" >&2; exit 1; }
ssh "${CONTROLLERS[0]}" "sudo ${SPUR_INSTALL_DIR}/spur nodes >/dev/null" \
  || { echo "cluster is not healthy before starting — investigate first" >&2; exit 1; }

```

Notes:
- **Drain, don't kill.** `spur node drain` stops new scheduling onto a node and lets its running jobs finish on their own (`DRAINING → DRAINED`); it does not evict them. Only touch the binary/restart `spurd` once a node reaches `DRAINED`.
- **A drained node stays drained after `spurd` restarts** — draining is server-side state, not tied to the agent process. The `scontrol update ... State=RESUME` step is mandatory, or upgraded capacity sits idle indefinitely.
- **Controllers never restart in parallel.** With < 3 controllers there's no other controller to fail over to during the restart, so a rolling upgrade of a single-controller (or 2-controller) cluster is still a short outage — this only buys zero-downtime with a real HA quorum (≥ 3).
- If any step aborts partway, the cluster is left in a safe, valid state (some hosts upgraded, some not, nothing drained-and-forgotten except mid-batch — check `spur nodes` for any node still `DRAIN`/`DRAINING` and `RESUME` it manually before retrying).

## Gotchas (all hard-won — don't relearn them)

### Install / systemd
- **This skill uses systemd**, not `nohup`. Units are `/etc/systemd/system/spur{ctld,d}.service` (`spurdbd.service` only exists as a leftover from a pre-merge deployment — see Step 5b), `enabled` (survive reboot), `Restart=on-failure`. Always `systemctl daemon-reload` after writing a unit.
- **`spur --version` is NOT supported** — it errors. Check the binary with `test -x`, not by running `--version`.
- **`install.sh` now works** (ROCm/spur publishes releases) — leaving `SPUR_BINARY_SRC` unset downloads one automatically. Set `SPUR_BINARY_SRC` to a local dir of pre-built binaries instead for mainline changes not yet released, air-gapped installs, or a custom build.
- **Slurm-compat symlinks** — all 18 names the `spur` multi-call binary recognizes via argv[0] dispatch (`sbatch`, `squeue`, `sinfo`, `scancel`, `sacct`, `sacctmgr`, `scontrol`, `salloc`, `srun`, `sattach`, `scrontab`, `sdiag`, `smd`, `sprio`, `sreport`, `sshare`, `sstat`, `strigger`) → `spur` — are created on every install path.
- **`pkill -f spurd` also kills `spurctld`** (substring match). Always `pkill -x` (exact name).

### Accounting
- **No separate accounting daemon** — upstream folded `spurdbd` into `spurctld`. Deploy Postgres BEFORE the controllers (Step 5 precedes Step 6) so each controller's embedded accounting service can connect and migrate on startup.
- **Every controller needs network access to Postgres, not just localhost** — each spurctld connects directly, so `listen_addresses`/`pg_hba.conf` must allow every controller's IP (Step 5), not just `ACCT_HOST`.
- **Migrations run automatically inside spurctld** against `database_url`; a failed migration disables accounting for that controller (scheduling still works, `sacct` won't) rather than crashing it.
- **Default DB creds are `spur/spur/spur`** — fine for a lab, change `ACCT_DB_PASSWORD` for anything real. Flag this to the user.
- **`SPUR_WIPE_STATE` defaults to `false`** — re-runs and upgrades preserve the Raft job queue and node registrations. `SPUR_WIPE_STATE=true` resets the Raft job-id counter (job ids restart at 1, upserting onto the same accounting rows); use it only for a fresh install or intentional reinit.
- **Rebuild all three binaries together for an upgrade.** The daemons share a Raft WAL schema. Pushing a `spurctld` built from a different tree than its peers can crash it on start (`unknown variant …` / `LogIndex(N) violates`) when it reads a log entry it can't parse.
- **Changing the controller set needs a wipe** (Spur 0.3.0 has no online membership change). Adding/removing/reordering a controller with state preserved leaves openraft with a mismatched on-disk membership. Agents are not Raft members — add/remove them freely.
- **A stale dpkg lock** (`Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend`) means another apt/unattended-upgrade is running. Wait for it, or clear a genuinely hung `apt-get` before retrying — don't `--force`.
- **Migrating a pre-merge cluster leaves a stale `spurdbd` behind if you skip Step 5b** — it keeps running (harmlessly) alongside the new embedded accounting until explicitly stopped/disabled/removed.

### Spur quirks
- **Output file `spur-<N>.out` goes to the job's `WorkDir` = the CWD at submit time.** Submitting from `/tmp` writes `/tmp/spur-<N>.out`; submitting from the SSH user's home writes it there. Do NOT `cd` into a 0700 dir (e.g. `/root/spur`) when SSHing as a non-root user — the `cd` fails and WorkDir silently becomes the user's home. Pin the submit CWD to `/tmp` for predictability, and search `/tmp /home /root ${SPUR_HOME}` when hunting for output.
- **`spur nodes` collapses by partition.** To verify per-host registration, loop `spur show node <name>`.
- **`spur show node <name>` does not filter server-side at all — it prints every registered node regardless of the argument.** (Tested against Spur 0.3.0; treat the "prefix match" framing as describing symptom, not mechanism.) Always pipe through `awk -v n=<name> '/^NodeName=/{p=($0=="NodeName="n)} p'` to isolate one node's block — this is required for correctness, not just to break prefix ties.
- **`spur show job` uses `JobState=COMPLETED` (uppercase).** Parse `JobState=[A-Z]+`.
- **Raft port 6821 is hardcoded** in spurctld (not a CLI flag). Preflight must include it.
- **Harmless log spam `invalid transition from Completed to Completed`** on followers after multi-node jobs — the job actually succeeded.
- **Harmless `ERROR`-level openraft log line on every spurctld restart** — `Can not initialize last_log_id=Some(...) vote=...:committed`. Despite the `ERROR` severity, this is normal on a restart with existing Raft state (single-node or HA); it doesn't indicate a problem — check `spur nodes`/job/accounting behavior, not this log line, to judge success.
- **Harmless spurd startup warning `failed to load spur.conf ... path=/etc/spur/spur.conf`** — `spurd` is driven entirely by CLI flags and never actually reads a config file; this warning is always present and doesn't indicate misconfiguration.
- **`$SPUR_NUM_NODES` is not set in the job environment** (as of Spur 0.3.0) even in multi-node jobs — only `$SPUR_TASK_OFFSET` and `$SPUR_PEER_NODES` are populated. A smoke-test script referencing it will print an empty value; don't treat that as a failure signal.
- **A per-job scratch file (e.g. `.spur_job_<id>.sh`) can be left behind in an agent's WorkDir** and, on a shared/reused host, block a later job with a different id from writing its own script (`agent rejected job: failed to write job script`). The job then sits in `COMPLETING` forever and the node shows `mix` instead of `idle` — there's no automatic timeout/recovery. Fix by `spur cancel <jobid>` and removing the stale scratch file by hand; teardown (Step 11) does not clean these up since it only removes `${SPUR_HOME}` and `*.out` files, not arbitrary WorkDirs.

### Multi-node / HA specifics
- **Agent `--hostname` must match the `[[nodes]]` name in `spur.conf`** and `spur show node <name>`. Use `hostname -s` consistently.
- **Pass `--hostname` and `--address` explicitly to spurd.** Auto-detect picks `127.0.0.1`, breaking inter-node dispatch.
- **No shared-FS assumption.** Each node writes its own `spur-<JOBID>.out` locally; fetch from every agent.
- **HA needs a leader-elected wait**, not just port-listening. Loop on `no leader elected yet` until it clears.
- **HA `peers` list order must be stable across redeploys.** `node_id` is the 1-based position; reordering breaks openraft. To re-order, wipe state on every controller and redeploy.
- **`-N` in a multi-node job must not exceed the agent count**, or it stays PENDING.
- **Separate-compute HA:** controllers NOT in `AGENTS` must have no `spurd`. Verify with `systemctl is-active spurd` → `inactive`.
- **Client-side failover is automatic.** `spurd --controller` and the CLI's `SPUR_CONTROLLER_ADDR` accept a comma-separated endpoint list and rotate past a dead one, so every agent and each controller's own env lists *every* controller, not just `CONTROLLERS[0]`. No VIP/DNS is required for basic failover.

## Report back

End the run with:
- Mode + counts (X controllers, Y agents), transport, accounting on/off
- Per-host: install source (binary-src vs installer), `systemctl is-active` for each daemon, log source (`journalctl -u spurctld`/`spurd`, or `spurdbd` if a legacy pre-merge unit is still present)
- `spur nodes` output
- HA only: which `node_id` became leader
- Accounting only: `sacct` output + DB job count
- Test job IDs + stdout (single, and multi if run)
- Any deviation from this skill — flag it so the skill can be patched
