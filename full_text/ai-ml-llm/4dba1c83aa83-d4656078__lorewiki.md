# lorewiki

Local-first Markdown knowledge base. Index a directory of `.md` files into
SQLite + FTS5, then retrieve / answer / browse / author via the `lorewiki` CLI.

**Why this skill**: every command is one shell call, output is structured
JSON by default for `search`/`show`/`tree` (no flag needed), no daemon
to keep alive, no client config, no server to run. Works inside
opencode / Codex / Aider / cron / CI scripts.

**Output convention** (v0.2.0+):

| Command        | Default                  | Human-readable flag        |
|----------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| `search`       | JSON (for agents)        | `--human` (Rich Table)     |
| `tree`         | Rich Tree                | (always human)             |
| `show`         | Cleaned markdown body    | `--raw` (on-disk verbatim) |
| `ask`          | Markdown-rendered answer | `--raw` (JSON)             |
| `topic list`   | Rich panel               | `--raw` (JSON)             |
| `add`          | Rich panel               | `--raw` (JSON)             |

## When To Use

Invoke this skill whenever the user wants to:

- **Read** — search the wiki (`lorewiki search`), ask a question
  (`lorewiki ask`), browse the hierarchy (`lorewiki tree`), or dump a
  single doc (`lorewiki show`).
- **Write** — author a single note end-to-end via `lorewiki add`. The
  command takes body via `--body` / `--file` / stdin, slugifies the
  title into a filename, writes a Markdown file with frontmatter,
  and triggers an incremental `build_index` so the new doc is
  immediately retrievable. Use this whenever the user wants to
  persist a learning, decision, postmortem, or any small chunk of
  knowledge into the wiki.
- **Index** — refresh the SQLite index from disk after manual edits
  to .md files (`lorewiki index`). `add` runs this for you.
- **Inspect** — `lorewiki status` shows chunk / doc / last-indexed
  counts; `lorewiki topic list` enumerates topics.

Trigger words: `wiki`, `knowledge base`, `lorewiki`, `internal docs`,
`runbook`, `postmortem`, `team docs` — and the obvious
language-localised equivalents in whatever language the user is
using. The LLM should match by *intent* (recall / save a note /
browse the structure), not by exact keyword match.

## Auto-Trigger Rules (DO NOT ASK, JUST SEARCH)

You should **automatically** call `lorewiki search` without asking the
user for permission, in these situations:

1. **Unfamiliar API** — if you're about to write code that calls an
   API, framework, or library you're not 100% sure about, search first.
   ```
   # Before writing: wx.login(...)  →  search "wx.login" first
   lorewiki search "wx.login" --top-k 3
   ```

2. **User mentions a concept** — if the user asks about "登录流程",
   "幂等设计", "限流方案", "retry strategy", or any domain concept,
   search the wiki **before** answering. The wiki may have team-specific
   decisions,踩坑记录, or API docs that are more accurate than your
   training data.

3. **About to guess** — if you find yourself about to write code based
   on assumption or vague memory, **stop and search**. The wiki exists
   to prevent exactly this kind of hallucination.

4. **Error pattern encountered** — if you or the user encounter an error,
   search for known issues and solutions:
   ```
   lorewiki search "<error message keywords>" --top-k 5
   # Or search specifically for lessons learned:
   # (when --type filter is available)
   lorewiki search "<problem description>" --top-k 5
   ```

5. **Before suggesting a design pattern** — if you're about to recommend
   "use retry with exponential backoff" or "implement idempotency key",
   search the wiki first. The team may already have a documented pattern
   with specific parameters, code examples, and known pitfalls.

**Do NOT ask the user "should I search the wiki?"** — just search. The
cost of a search is ~3ms; the cost of hallucinating wrong API usage is
a broken build and lost trust. If the wiki has nothing relevant (`hits
== []`), proceed with your best judgment and mention "wiki has no docs
on this".

**After searching**: if the search returns relevant docs, use
`lorewiki show <doc_path> --raw` to read the full content before
writing code. The search returns summaries; you need the full doc for
implementation details.

## Prerequisites

The `lorewiki` CLI must be on the user's PATH. Check with:

```powershell
lorewiki --version    # expect: LoreWiki 1.1.0 (or newer)
```

If missing:

```powershell
# From the source repo (editable install — easiest for active development)
pip install -e D:/codes/Lorewiki

# Or, once published, via pipx for an isolated global install
pipx install lorewiki
```

The user must also have a wiki directory with at least `<wiki>/.lorewiki/config.toml`.
Initialise one if absent: `lorewiki init --path <PATH>`.

## Topic and Project Binding Convention

LoreWiki supports two simple ways to choose knowledge:

- **Project-bound lookup**: a code project can set `default_topic` in
  `<project>/.lorewiki/config.toml`. `lorewiki search` automatically
  discovers that config from the current directory or any ancestor, so
  agents can run it from `src/...` and still hit the right project wiki.
- **Explicit common lookup**: pass `--topic <name>` for one-off queries,
  e.g. `lorewiki --topic shared search "retry backoff"`.

Recommended project binding from a project root:

```powershell
lorewiki config set default_topic lorewiki
```

**Topic resolution priority**:

1. Explicit `--topic <name>` on the command.
2. `LOREWIKI_TOPIC` environment variable.
3. `<cwd-or-ancestor>/.lorewiki/config.toml` with `default_topic = "name"`.
4. `~/.lorewiki/current` file set by `lorewiki topic use <name>`.
5. Legacy `--path <WIKI_ROOT>` / `wiki_path` mode for standalone wiki folders.

Prefer the default project-bound call when working inside a bound codebase:

```powershell
lorewiki search "config resolution" --top-k 5
```

Use explicit topic calls for shared/common knowledge or when the user names
a topic:

```powershell
lorewiki --topic shared search "python packaging pitfalls" --top-k 5
```

Use `--path <WIKI_ROOT>` only for legacy standalone wiki folders, not for
normal topic-based project work.

## Topics (second-brain vaults)

Topics are isolated vaults under `~/lorewiki/topics/<name>/`, shared across
every project the user works in. Discovery flow when the user asks
"look up X in my react notes" or "search the cocos wiki":

1. `lorewiki topic list --raw` — enumerate. The active one is starred
   (`*`); its name is the value of `~/lorewiki/current`.
2. If the current project has `default_topic`, use it by default.
3. If the user wants another topic, pass `--topic <name>` for that call.
4. If the user mentions a topic that doesn't exist yet, follow the
   **Naming Protocol** below to pick a name and confirm with the user.
5. The active topic's wiki root doubles as an Obsidian / Logseq
   vault — the user may prefer to edit Markdown directly and just
   re-run `lorewiki index` (which is incremental).

### Naming Protocol

When the user says "make me a wiki for X" and X is a free-form
description (e.g. "react hooks learning", "wechat miniprogram dev"),
**do not** silently invent a name. Follow this protocol:

1. `lorewiki topic list --raw` — check for name collisions and pick
   the active topic (if any) for context.
2. `lorewiki topic suggest "<X description>"` — get 1-4 candidate
   slugs. The algorithm is rule-based (slugify + stopword removal);
   for CJK-only descriptions it returns nothing.
3. **Show the user the candidates and ask which to use.** Don't
   auto-pick. Example reply:
   > I can call this `wechat-mp`, `wechat-miniprogram`, or `mp`. Which
   > do you prefer? (Or pick your own name — rules: lowercase,
   > digits, hyphens, 1-64 chars.)
4. `lorewiki topic create <chosen> [--source <path-to-existing-md>]`.
   Default mode copies; `--link` symlinks instead.
5. If the user later dislikes the name, `lorewiki topic rename
   <old> <new>` renames in place (the index and config move with
   it; the active pointer is updated if applicable).

`topic suggest` is **English-friendly** by design. For CJK
descriptions, the command exits with code 1 and prints a panel that
tells the user to name the topic by hand. The agent should fall
back to asking the user explicitly in that case.

### Topic Selection Before Writing (the "ask, don't surprise" rule)

If the user says "save this to my wiki" / "记到 wiki 里" / "メモして"
**without naming a topic**, the LLM must **not** auto-create a topic
on the user's behalf. The wiki is a long-lived knowledge asset —
silently dropping a doc into a freshly-invented `general` vault is
surprising and pollutes the user's mental model.

Follow this tree strictly, and **ask the user at the leaves**:

```text
User: "save X to my wiki"  (no topic named)
  │
  ├── 1. Is there an active topic?  (~/lorewiki/current exists)
  │     ├── YES → use it. No question needed.
  │     └── NO  → go to step 2.
  │
  ├── 2. How many topics exist?  (lorewiki topic list --raw)
  │     ├── 1 → "I see one topic '<name>'. Use it?" (one confirmation)
  │     ├── 2-3 → list them, ask "which one?" (free text or pick)
  │     └── 4+ → ask "which one?" (don't auto-pick)
  │
  └── 3. Zero topics exist
        ├── Run `lorewiki topic suggest "<X summary>"` for English
        │   descriptions, OR have the LLM propose 1-3 names itself
        │   for CJK descriptions.
        └── Show candidates to the user:
              "I can create topic 'wechat-mp', 'wechat-miniprogram',
              or 'mp'. Which? (Or pick your own — lowercase, digits,
              hyphens, 1-64 chars.)"
            User picks → lorewiki topic create <name>
            User rejects all → ask for a name by hand.
```

**Why this matters**: a user who has spent a year curating
`~/lorewiki/topics/react/`, `~/lorewiki/topics/api/`, etc., does
**not** want their work silently merged into a `general` vault just
because they said "wiki" without naming a topic. The cost of asking
once is one round-trip; the cost of surprising the user is having
to undo the merger later.

**Path resolution priority**:
1. `--topic` flag
2. `LOREWIKI_TOPIC` env var
3. cwd or ancestor `.lorewiki/config.toml` with `default_topic`
4. `~/lorewiki/current` file (set by `lorewiki topic use`)
5. `--path` / `wiki_path` legacy per-wiki mode

Topic names: lowercase ASCII, digits, hyphens, 1-64 chars, no
leading/trailing hyphens. The `lorewiki topic create` command will
reject anything else with a clear error.

**Important**: a `~/.lorewiki/topics/<name>/.lorewiki/index.db` only
exists *after* `lorewiki index` has been run. If the user asks to
search a brand-new topic, expect the `No index found` panel — point
them at `lorewiki topic use <name> && lorewiki index`.

## Core Workflows

### 1. Retrieve and cite (most common)

User asks something likely covered by team docs ⇒ search, then ground the
answer in the returned chunks with file-path citations.

```powershell
lorewiki search "<question or keywords>" `
    --path "<WIKI>" --mode mix --top-k 5
```

**No `--raw` flag** for `search` — JSON is the default. Pass `--human` if
you actually want a Rich Table for terminal eyeballing (rare for agents).

Returned JSON shape (parse it; don't grep the prettified panel):

```json
[
  {
    "chunk_id": "api/user/auth.md#0",
    "doc_path": "api/user/auth.md",
    "title": "Authentication API",
    "heading_path": "Auth API > Overview",
    "module": "api/user",
    "snippet": "...",
    "score": 0.029,
    "retriever": "mix"
  },
  ...
]
```

The `snippet` field contains the **full chunk body** (anchor markup, scraper
boilerplate, and the translation footer are stripped at index time — see
`lorewiki.indexer.cleaning` for the rules). The `title` has no leading `#`
and `heading_path` is ` > `-joined segments with anchors removed. The
breadcrumb prefix that the chunker adds for FTS recall is also stripped
from the snippet (it's already in `heading_path`).

Then compose an answer that:
- quotes the relevant snippets,
- cites each fact with its `doc_path` (and optionally `heading_path`),
- does NOT fabricate beyond what the snippets say.

### 2. LLM-assisted answer

When the user explicitly wants a synthesised answer (not just chunks),
use `ask`. It already does retrieval + prompt assembly + LLM call:

```powershell
lorewiki ask "<question>" --path "<WIKI>" --top-k 5 --raw
```

`ask` defaults to a Markdown-rendered panel (human-friendly); add
`--raw` to get the JSON shape with `answer`, `used_llm`, `degraded_reason`,
and `hits`. If `used_llm == false`, hand the `answer` text straight back
to the user — no need for a second tool call.

### 3. Discover the structure (before broad questions)

If the user's request is broad ("what's in the wiki?", "what modules do we
have?"), use the tree view:

```powershell
lorewiki tree                    # full hierarchy
lorewiki tree api/share --depth 3   # sub-tree with depth limit
```

For "show me everything under module X" style queries, search in hierarchy
mode (returns chunks grouped by the matched tree node):

```powershell
lorewiki search "<module name>" --path "<WIKI>" --mode hierarchy --top-k 10
```

### 4. Write a new note to the wiki (knowledge persistence)

Follow this template strictly so the indexer picks up the right metadata:

```markdown
---
title: "Decision: switch to Redis Streams for event bus"
module: decisions
tags: [decision, infra, redis]
owner: platform-team
last_review: 2026-06-10
---

# Decision: switch to Redis Streams

## Context
<why we are deciding this>

## Decision
<what we will do>

## Consequences
<trade-offs + follow-ups>
```

**Frontmatter rules** (the indexer reads these fields):

| Field         | Required        | Notes                                                                            |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `title`         | best-effort      | Frontmatter wins, else first H1, else the filename. Always set it explicitly.    |
| `module`        | best-effort      | Logical hierarchy path (e.g. `decisions`, `api/user`). See §Path semantics below. |
| `tags`          | optional         | Free-form list; aids hierarchy search.                                          |
| `owner`         | optional         | Team or person responsible.                                                       |
| `last_review`   | optional         | ISO date; helps with staleness audits.                                            |

Place it under the right module directory, then re-index:

```powershell
# 1) Write the file (use the Write/Edit tool — never `Out-File`, BOM issues)
#    Target path example: D:/codes/Lorewiki/example_wiki/decisions/redis-streams.md

# 2) Re-index (incremental — only changed files are re-processed)
lorewiki index --path "<WIKI>"
```

Verify by searching for a distinctive phrase from the new doc:

```powershell
lorewiki search "Redis Streams decision" --path "<WIKI>" --mode mix --top-k 3
```

#### Path semantics (read this once, it shapes the whole vault)

The `module:` field is a **logical category**, not a physical file path.
The two don't have to match (the parser doesn't enforce it), but
**keep them aligned** so the hierarchy tree is useful for browsing:

- **Aligned** (recommended): file at `api/user/auth.md` has
  `module: api/user`. Walking the hierarchy gives you
  `api/ → api/user/ → docs` and the file shows up under
  `api/user` in `lorewiki status`.
- **Mis-aligned** (allowed, but degrades the UI): file at
  `patterns/rate-limit.md` with `module: patterns` — the
  hierarchy only shows one level (`patterns`), but the file still
  indexes and searches normally.

**Rule of thumb**: when in doubt, set `module` to the directory the
file is in (or a sensible parent).

#### Quality checklist for scraped / external content

If you are **fetching** documentation and writing it into the vault
(common workflow in the user's AI tools), the indexer will accept
anything but search quality collapses on certain patterns. **Don't**:

| Anti-pattern                                              | Why it breaks                                                                              | What to do instead                                                                          |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Filename ending in `.html` (e.g. `wx.arrayBufferToBase64.html`) | Obsidian / Logseq render the file as raw HTML source; internal links fail to resolve | Strip the `.html` extension. The file is markdown, not HTML.                              |
| `_index.md` (underscore-prefixed)                         | LoreWiki has no special handling for `_index.md`; you'll get an empty `title: ""` and the indexer falls back to the first H1, which is often a quote or nav block | Use plain `index.md` (or a topic-specific name like `api-overview.md`).                   |
| `title: ""` (empty in frontmatter)                        | The indexer falls back to the first H1 — if the first H1 is a quote, a nav link, or a heading with special characters, search titles become ugly | Always fill `title` with a short, human-readable summary.                                |
| Internal links pointing to `.html` files                 | `(/api/base/wx.env.html)` — Obsidian and the indexer can't follow them                | Strip `.html` from the link target, or convert to the equivalent `.md` path.              |
| Module path with spaces / capital letters                | The hierarchy tree treats it as a distinct node; search ranks it as a separate entity | Use kebab-case lowercase segments: `api/user`, `patterns/rate-limit`, `decisions/redis`.    |
| Scrape artefact files in the vault root (e.g. `manifest.json`, `scrape.log`) | These pollute the Obsidian vault view; they don't index but they confuse the user | Put scrape artefacts in a separate cache directory (`~/.lorewiki/.scrape-cache/<topic>/`), not in the vault |

After the write, run `lorewiki index --path "<WIKI>"` and spot-check
with `lorewiki status --path "<WIKI>"` — the chunk count and
hierarchy depth will tell you if the structure is sensible.

### 5. Fresh wiki bootstrap

```powershell
lorewiki init --path "<NEW_WIKI_DIR>"
# Author Markdown files under <NEW_WIKI_DIR>/...
lorewiki index --path "<NEW_WIKI_DIR>" --rebuild
lorewiki status --path "<NEW_WIKI_DIR>"
```

### 6. Configuration inspection / change

> **Single source of truth**: all lorewiki config lives in **one**
> file: `~/.lorewiki/config.toml`. We **no longer** drop a
> `config.toml` into each topic root (it polluted the vault view
> in Obsidian / Logseq). If you need per-topic overrides, edit the
> global file with a `[topics.<name>]` section header.

There is **no config.toml to discover** until the user creates one.
The recommended way to bootstrap it:

```powershell
# Option A — interactive, recommended for humans
lorewiki config set llm.enabled true
lorewiki config set llm.backend '"openai"'
lorewiki config set llm.openai_api_key '"sk-..."'
lorewiki config set llm.openai_model '"gpt-4o-mini"'
# (each call writes ~/.lorewiki/config.toml; subsequent `lorewiki config list`
#  shows the merged result)

# Option B — write the file directly
# Recommended for headless / CI use, and the only way to set
# OpenAI-compatible endpoints that point at OpenRouter / vLLM / etc.
notepad ~/.lorewiki/config.toml     # or your editor of choice
```

A fully-populated `~/.lorewiki/config.toml` (every supported key
is shown, comments mark the lines you'll most often change):

```toml
# ~/.lorewiki/config.toml — LoreWiki's single config file.
# Anything you don't set here falls back to the in-code default.

# ----- Retrieval -----
retrieval_mode = "mix"                # mix | bm25 | hierarchy | vector
mix_weights_bm25 = 1.0
mix_weights_hierarchy = 0.8
mix_weights_vector = 0.5
rrf_k = 60                            # RRF smoothing constant
chunk_max_tokens = 800
chunk_overlap_tokens = 100
chunk_min_chars = 40
snippet_chars = 240

# ----- LLM (optional) -----
# Enabled = false by default. When false, `lorewiki ask` falls
# back to the top-K chunks panel (graceful degradation).
[llm]
enabled = false

# --- Option A: local Ollama ---
backend = "ollama"
ollama_url = "http://localhost:11434"
ollama_model = "qwen2.5:7b"

# --- Option B: OpenAI-compatible (any provider speaking ---
# ---   POST /v1/chat/completions)                       ---
# backend = "openai"
# openai_api_key = "sk-or-..."           # OpenRouter key, OpenAI key, etc.
# openai_base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"   # <- any vLLM-compatible endpoint
# openai_model = "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free"

# timeout_seconds = 30.0
```

Quick CLI:

```powershell
lorewiki config list                   # show the resolved config (with defaults)
lorewiki config get llm.backend        # get one key
lorewiki config set llm.enabled true   # set one key (auto-creates the file)
lorewiki config set llm.openai_base_url '"https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"'
# Note: when setting a string, quote it as a TOML literal.
```

> **Note on Azure OpenAI**: the Azure endpoint path is
> `/openai/deployments/<deployment>/chat/completions?api-version=...`
> and is **not** currently supported. Use OpenRouter or a
> self-hosted vLLM-compatible endpoint, or wait for phase-7 Azure
> support (open an issue if you need it sooner).

### 7. Write to the wiki — pick the right path

There are three honest ways to put content into the wiki. Pick the
smallest one that does the job — over-engineering hurts:

| Scenario                                                   | Use                                                                                           |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **One-off note** (1-3 paragraphs, user just told you)       | `lorewiki add --title ... --body ...` — writes + auto-indexes in one step.                     |
| **A handful of related notes** (≤ ~20)                     | Run `lorewiki add` a few times in a loop. Don't write a script.                                |
| **Bulk scrape** (tens to thousands of files, e.g. scraping  | Either (a) drop the directory under the active topic and run `lorewiki index` (one-shot),   |
| a vendor's docs, importing a git repo, etc.)                | or (b) write a short Python script that writes `.md` files with frontmatter and call       |
|                                                            | `lorewiki index` once at the end.                                                             |
| **Topic bootstrap** (creating a new isolated vault)         | `lorewiki topic create <name> [--source <path>]` — the topic system is built for this.        |

**Auto-judgment rule for the LLM**: if the user pasted a single
short note, reach for `lorewiki add`. If the user gave you a list,
a URL, or a directory to capture, reach for a Python script (or
`lorewiki topic create --source`). Don't run `lorewiki add` in a
50-iteration loop — the per-invocation indexing cost adds up. The
user's language for "store this" / "capture these" / "记一下" /
"保存这些" / "メモして" / whatever is irrelevant to the rule; the
trigger is *shape* (paragraph vs list/URL/directory), not language.

#### `lorewiki add` quick reference

```powershell
# Inline body
lorewiki add `
  --title "Python Design" `
  --module patterns `
  --tag python --tag design `
  --body "Some deep details about Python design pattern."

# Pipe from stdin (no --body)
echo "# Inferred Title`n`nbody text" | lorewiki add --module notes

# Bulk scrape: short Python script
$urls = @("https://vendor.example.com/docs/a", "https://vendor.example.com/docs/b")
foreach ($u in $urls) {
    $md = (Invoke-WebRequest $u).Content | ./scrape.ps1
    $slug = ($u -split "/" | Select-Object -Last 1) -replace ".html$", ""
    lorewiki add --title $slug --module scraped --body $md --path $wiki
}
lorewiki index  # only if add was called many times; usually redundant
```

The file lands at `<wiki>/<module>/<slug>.md`; the slug is derived
from the title via ASCII-only normalisation (Chinese characters in
the title are stripped, so "RISC-V 工具链" becomes `risc-v` — see
[slug caveats](#slug-caveats) below). After a successful write,
an incremental `build_index` runs so the new doc is immediately
retrievable. Use `--raw` for machine-readable JSON output,
`--force` to overwrite an existing file. The path-traversal check
will reject any `--module` value that resolves outside the wiki
root.

#### Slug caveats

The slug is built with `[^a-z0-9]+` → `-`, lowercased, trimmed, then
capped at 64 chars. **Non-ASCII characters in the title are
stripped** — so a title like "RISC-V 工具链" produces the slug
`risc-v` (the CJK portion is gone). The body keeps everything;
only the filename is ASCII-folded. This affects every non-ASCII
script uniformly (CJK, Vietnamese, Thai, Korean, Cyrillic, etc.).
For better filename preservation, the user should pick an
English title and put the original-language text in `--body`.

## Modes (`--mode` flag for search / configured for ask)

| Mode      | Best for                                            | Notes                                       |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `mix`     | Almost everything (default).                        | RRF-fused BM25 + hierarchy. Highest recall. |
| `bm25`    | Exact-term / English / code-symbol queries.         | FTS5 trigram + LIKE fallback for short CJK. |
| `hierarchy` | "Show me everything under module X" style queries.| Walks the module tree from matched node.    |
| `vector`  | Not implemented yet — silently falls back to `mix`. | Reserved for the phase-6 sqlite-vec layer.  |

## Output Discipline

- **`search` already defaults to JSON** — no flag needed. Only `ask`,
  `topic list`, `topic suggest`, and `show` have a `--raw` (for those,
  `--raw` is *opt-in* to switch off the human-friendly default).
- **Cite by `doc_path`** in your final answer (`[api/user/auth.md]`), not by
  internal chunk IDs.
- If the wiki has nothing relevant (`hits == []`), say so plainly. Do NOT
  hallucinate content the wiki doesn't contain.
- For `ask` with `used_llm == false`, the returned `answer` already lists
  the chunks — you can pass it through unchanged.
- **Auto-judge the write path**: prefer `lorewiki add` for 1-3
  paragraphs the user just told you. Drop a directory + `lorewiki index`
  for bulk. **Never** wrap `add` in a 50-iteration loop when a
  short script + one index call would be cleaner.
- **Topic routing** (`--topic` / `-T`): **always** pass `--topic` when
  adding a note that belongs to a specific project's topic. Project-specific
  notes go to their dedicated topic (e.g. `--topic warm-kitchen-time`);
  cross-project patterns go to `--topic shared`. Without `--topic` the note
  lands in the active topic, which may not be the right one. The MCP `add`
  tool accepts a `topic` parameter with the same semantics.

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall                                                              | Avoidance                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reaching for `lorewiki add` in a tight loop for bulk ingestion.      | Drop the source directory and run `lorewiki index` once. Re-indexing every add is O(N) — a single bulk index is O(1).               |
| Searching with a 1-2 character CJK query and getting "0 hits".       | Combine with at least one more char or use `--mode bm25` which falls back to LIKE for short queries.                                  |
| Forgetting `--path` and assuming `cwd` has a wiki config.            | Always pass `--path`. If the user is ambiguous, follow the priority chain in [Path Handling Convention](#path-handling-convention).   |
| Editing a `.md` and not re-indexing.                                 | `lorewiki index --path "<WIKI>"` is incremental — unchanged files skip; just run it.                                                  |
| Using `Out-File` / `Set-Content` in PowerShell to write Markdown — may add BOM that breaks frontmatter parsing. | Use the agent's Write / Edit tool, or `[IO.File]::WriteAllText` with UTF-8 no-BOM.                                                    |
| Asking `lorewiki ask` and assuming an LLM answer.                    | Check the `used_llm` field in `ask --raw` output; fallback is normal and useful.                                                          |
| JSON output appears as `?` / replacement chars on Windows PowerShell. | The CLI forces UTF-8 stdout. If you still see it: (a) upgrade `lorewiki`; (b) as a fallback, prefix the command with `chcp 65001 |` to force the shell code page to UTF-8; (c) parse the prettified terminal panel for the `doc_path` and use the `Read` tool on the source `.md` file. |
| Brute-force scanning the whole filesystem when the wiki path is unknown. | Use the bounded-depth scan in [Path Handling Convention](#path-handling-convention) (Depth 3 against a small set of plausible roots such as the user's workspace and ``$HOME/Documents``), not ``Get-ChildItem -Recurse`` against an entire drive root. The exact list of roots is platform-specific; pick a small handful that makes sense for the user's machine, never a full recursive scan. |

| "save this URL / doc to my wiki"                                 | Fetch content (webfetch / Read tool) → `lorewiki add --title X --body "<fetched>"` |
| "store these N pages / scrape this site"                | Drop the dir under the topic, then `lorewiki index`           |

## MCP Server & Auto-Inject (for advanced setups)

LoreWiki also ships an **MCP server** (`lorewiki mcp serve`) and an
**auto-inject** command (`lorewiki inject`) for tools that support
these integration patterns. See the README's "LLM Integration" section
for setup details. If you're reading this skill, you don't need them —
the skill is the universal fallback.
