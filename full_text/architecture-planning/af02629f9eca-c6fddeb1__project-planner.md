# Project Planner

## Skill Metadata

**Name:** Project Planner
**Version:** 1.12.0
**Author:** Captain Nahla Ake (Starfleet Academy Chancellor)
**Command:** `/plan-project`
**Platforms:** All dev-team platforms
**Last Updated:** July 13, 2026

---

## Purpose

This skill provides **planning-only** project management. It creates all planning artifacts (kanban items, subitems, plan documents) but **NEVER executes implementation**.

The skill enforces a deliberate handoff checkpoint, allowing work to be delegated to other agents or deferred for later.

### What This Skill Does

1. **Analyzes** the project/feature requirements
2. **Researches** the codebase to understand scope and impact
3. **Creates** a kanban backlog item with proper metadata
4. **Creates** all subitems (phased implementation steps)
5. **Creates** a plan document in the team's `kanban/` directory
6. **STOPS** with explicit handoff options

### What This Skill NEVER Does

- Start implementation
- Create or modify code files
- Run tests, builds, or linters
- Make commits or PRs
- Assume approval means "start working"

---

## Critical Behavior Rules

### MANDATORY: Plan Document Creation

**Every kanban item MUST have a corresponding plan document.** This is NOT optional.

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 ⛔ MANDATORY REQUIREMENT: NO KANBAN ITEM WITHOUT A PLAN DOCUMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

 Before displaying the handoff checkpoint, you MUST:

   1. Create the kanban backlog item (get ITEM-ID)
   2. Create all subitems
   3. Create the plan document at: <team-kanban>/<ITEM-ID>_<description>.md
   4. VERIFY the plan document was written successfully

 The handoff checkpoint CANNOT be displayed until the plan document exists.
 If document creation fails, report the error and retry.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Why This Is Mandatory:**
- Plan documents provide implementation context for any agent
- They preserve design decisions and rationale
- They enable delegation to other agents/terminals
- They serve as historical record of project scope
- Other agents check for plan docs when starting work

**Plan Document Location:** `<TEAM_KANBAN>/<ITEM-ID>_<10-30_char_description>.md`

⚠️ **CRITICAL: Team-Specific Paths** - Each team's plan documents MUST be stored in that team's `kanban/` directory. See [Plan Document Path Resolution](#plan-document-path-resolution) below.

**Examples (each in the team's own kanban directory):**
- `~/dev-team/kanban/XACA-0031_dark_mode_support.md` (Academy)
- `<ios-repo>/kanban/XIOS-0042_payment_flow_refactor.md` (iOS)
- `<firebase-repo>/kanban/XFIR-0055_account_deletion_api.md` (Firebase)
- `.../Starwords/kanban/XFSW-0020_setup_wizard.md` (Starwords)

### STOP AFTER PLANNING

After creating all planning artifacts (including the plan document), the skill MUST:

1. **Verify plan document exists** (use Read tool to confirm)
2. Display the "PROJECT PLANNING COMPLETE" banner
3. List all created artifacts (including plan doc path)
4. Present handoff options
5. **WAIT for explicit user instruction**

### NEVER Auto-Execute

Even if the user approves the plan, DO NOT start implementation unless they explicitly choose option 2 ("Start working on subitem 1") or similar.

**Approval of a plan is NOT permission to execute.**

### Handoff Options Template

Always end with this exact format:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 PROJECT PLANNING COMPLETE - READY FOR HANDOFF
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

 Created Artifacts:
   Kanban Item:  <ITEM-ID> "<Title>"
   Subitems:     <count> implementation phases
   Plan Doc:     <team-kanban>/<ITEM-ID>_<description>.md
   Priority:     <priority>
   Tags:         <tags>

 How would you like to proceed?

   1. DELEGATE - Assign to another agent/terminal
      Specify which team or terminal should work on this

   2. START NOW - I'll begin working on the first subitem
      Only choose this if you want ME to implement

   3. TRACK ONLY - Add to backlog, work on it later
      Item is ready whenever you want to start

   4. MODIFY PLAN - Adjust subitems or scope before proceeding
      I can add, remove, or reorder implementation phases

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Review & Test Subitem Governance

#### Protected Subitem Classification

Subitems tagged with `[Review]` or `[Test]` are **protected subitems** with special governance rules:

| Tier | Tags | Agent Can Cancel? | User Approval Required? |
|------|------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Standard | (none) | Yes, with reason | No |
| **Protected** | `[Review]`, `[Test]` | **No** | **Yes** |
| Mandatory | Core implementation | No | Yes |

#### Rules for Protected Subitems

1. **Review subitems are real work.** When a PR reviewer creates a `[Review]` subitem, they are creating a mandatory pre-merge work item — NOT an optional suggestion. All `[Review]` subitems MUST be resolved before the PR can be merged.

2. **Test subitems are real work.** When a QA tester creates a `[Test]` subitem, they are flagging quality issues that MUST be addressed.

3. **Agents CANNOT cancel protected subitems.** The only valid outcomes are:
   - **Completed** — the agent did the work
   - **Cancelled by user** — the user explicitly approved cancellation

4. **If cancellation seems warranted:** The agent must STOP, present the subitem and reasoning to the user, and WAIT for explicit approval before cancelling.

5. **"Cancelled with a reason" is NOT equivalent to "completed."** Agents must not use cancellation as a shortcut to avoid doing review/test work.

## ATTACH MODE: Planning Against Existing Items

**When to use ATTACH MODE:**

When kb-run, kb-work, or kb-debug invoke the Project Planner skill against an EXISTING kanban item that currently has ZERO subitems. This prevents duplicate item creation and allows planning to be attached to an item that was auto-created by the planning gate.

**ATTACH MODE invocation:**

```
Invoke the Project Planner skill in ATTACH MODE against this EXISTING item:

/plan-project --attach XACA-0801
```

**What ATTACH MODE does (and does NOT do):**

| Phase | Action | ATTACH MODE | Reason |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Phase 0** | Container Selection | **SKIP** | Container decision already made — the item exists |
| **Phase 1** | Requirements Analysis | **RUN** | Read the existing item's title/description as requirements input |
| **Phase 2** | Codebase Research | **RUN** | Understand scope and architectural impact |
| **Phase 3** | Kanban Item Creation | **⛔ FORBIDDEN** | Creating another item here produces a DUPLICATE (exact prohibition, not a suggestion) |
| **Phase 4** | Subitem Creation | **RUN** | Attach implementation subitems to the EXISTING item via `kb-backlog sub add <ITEM-ID> "..."` |
| **Phase 5** | Plan Document Creation | **RUN** | Create the canonical plan document for the existing item |
| **Handoff Checkpoint** | Display options | **STOP** | ATTACH MODE still stops here — plan approval is NOT execution approval |

**ATTACH MODE Protected Subitem Governance:**

ATTACH MODE MUST still emit the protected `[Review]`, `[Test]`, and `[UX]` subitems in the appropriate trailing positions (just as standard mode does). These subitems are precisely why the planning gate exists.

**Guard: Already Has Subitems**

If the item ALREADY has subitems when you invoke ATTACH MODE, STOP and report this to the user:

```
The item XACA-0801 already has subitems. ATTACH MODE is only for items with ZERO subitems.
Existing subitems:
  - [subitem-1]
  - [subitem-2]

ACTION: Either:
  1. Use the existing subitems (item already has a plan)
  2. Ask the user to approve cancellation of existing subitems before proceeding
```

Do NOT proceed in ATTACH MODE if subitems exist.

---

## Planning Process

### Phase 0: Container Selection (MANDATORY — DO THIS FIRST)

⚠️ **ATTACH MODE NOTE:** If you are planning against an EXISTING kanban item (e.g., from the auto-planning gate), skip Phase 0 and Phase 3. See [ATTACH MODE: Planning Against Existing Items](#attach-mode-planning-against-existing-items) for full details.

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 🛑 STOP — DO NOT CALL kb-backlog add YET
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

 Before creating ANY kanban container, decide which TYPE of container fits.
 The most common planning failure is creating a regular backlog item titled
 "EPIC: ...", "RELEASE: ...", or "TODO: ..." instead of using the real
 first-class container that already exists in our system.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Decision tree — answer in order, stop at the first YES:**

| # | Question | If YES → use | If NO → continue |
|---|----------|--------------|------------------|
| 1 | Does the work span **multiple kanban items, sprints, or teams** under one strategic theme? | **Kanban EPIC** — `kb-epic create "<title>" "<desc>" <priority> <category>` then `kb-epic add-item EPIC-xxxx <ITEM-ID>` for each child. Plan doc: `EPIC-xxxx_<description>.md`. | ↓ |
| 2 | Is the work a **coordinated deployment** to one or more platforms moving through environments (DEV→QA→PROD)? | **Kanban RELEASE** — `/release create "<name>" --platforms <list>` then `/release assign <ITEM-ID> <REL-ID>`. Plan doc: `REL-xxxx_<description>.md`. | ↓ |
| 3 | Is the work a **checklist of sequential steps** inside ONE piece of work that one agent will own? | **Subitems** of an existing parent — `kb-backlog sub add <PARENT-ID> "<step>"`. (Subitems ARE the kanban TODO list — do not invent a separate "TODO" item.) | ↓ |
| 4 | Is this a **single deliverable** that fits in one work session / PR? | **Plain backlog item** — `kb-backlog add "<title>" <priority> "<desc>"`. THIS is the only correct path to `kb-backlog add`. | Re-read the request — if you can't classify it, ask the user before creating anything. |

**FORBIDDEN naming patterns (immediate STOP if you're about to type these):**

```
❌  kb-backlog add "EPIC: <anything>"          →  use kb-epic create instead
❌  kb-backlog add "Release: <anything>"       →  use /release create instead
❌  kb-backlog add "RELEASE: <anything>"       →  use /release create instead
❌  kb-backlog add "REL-2026-Q2 something"     →  use /release create instead
❌  kb-backlog add "TODO: <anything>"          →  use kb-backlog sub add instead
❌  kb-backlog add "Checklist for <anything>"  →  use kb-backlog sub add instead
❌  kb-backlog add "<Initiative>: Phase 1"     →  use kb-epic + child items instead
```

**Attach-to-existing first:** Before creating any new container, check whether a matching epic or release already exists:

```bash
source ~/dev-team/kanban-helpers.sh
kb-epic list                                    # see existing epics for this team
kb-release list  # or:  /release list           # see active releases
```

If a parent exists, **attach** the new work to it (`kb-epic add-item` / `/release assign`) instead of creating a sibling container with a similar name.

**Why this matters:** Epic and Release are first-class containers in the LCARS UI with their own tabs, progress aggregation, environment promotion, and child-item rollups. A backlog item titled `"EPIC: Foo"` is a string — it doesn't aggregate progress, doesn't appear in the EPICS tab, doesn't link to children, and pollutes the regular backlog. Same for releases and TODO checklists.

**Only after Phase 0 is complete** — and you have selected the correct container type — proceed to Phase 1.

---

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis

1. Parse the user's project description
2. Identify key features and requirements
3. Determine scope (single feature vs. multi-phase project)
4. Identify the target team from context

### Phase 2: Codebase Research

1. Search for related existing code
2. Identify files that will need modification
3. Understand current architecture patterns
4. Note dependencies and integration points

**Tools to use:** Glob, Grep, Read, Task (with Explore agent)

**Tools NOT to use:** Edit, Write (for code), Bash (for builds/tests)

### Phase 3: Kanban Item Creation

Create the main backlog item using kanban-helpers:

```bash
source ~/dev-team/kanban-helpers.sh && kb-backlog add "<title>" <priority> "<description>" "<jira-id>" "<os>" --points <hours>
```

**`--points` is optional at creation but the item must be estimated before work begins.** Supply an estimate here when it is reasonably known (realistic normal-human developer hours, fractional OK — e.g. `--points 4` or `--points 0.5`). If the scope is unclear at planning time, omit it and set it with `kb-backlog points <id> <hours>` before the implementing agent runs `kb-pick` or `kb-run`.

### Phase 4: Subitem Creation

Break down into implementation phases:

```bash
source ~/dev-team/kanban-helpers.sh && kb-backlog sub add <item-id> "<subitem-title>"
```

**Subitem Guidelines:**
- 3-12 subitems per project (ideal: 5-8)
- Each subitem should be 1-4 hours of work
- Order by implementation dependency
- Group related work into phases
- Include documentation as explicit subitem when appropriate

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Testing/Debugging Subitem for Code Changes**

Any project that involves code changes MUST include a dedicated **"Testing & Debugging"** subitem. This is NOT optional.

**⚠️ MANDATORY: UX/UI Evaluation Subitem for UI-Touching Projects**

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**When UX/UI Evaluation subitem is required:**
- New feature with user-facing interface
- UI/UX modifications or design changes
- Responsive layout updates
- Accessibility improvements
- Theme or styling changes
- Any project modifying files in: `lcars-ui/`, `*.html`, `*.css`, `*.scss`, `*View.swift`, `res/layout/`, `res/drawable/`, etc.
- See docs/ux-eval-gate.md § "UI Surface Diff Paths" for complete heuristic patterns

**When UX/UI Evaluation subitem may be skipped or pre-cancelled:**
- Backend/infrastructure code with NO user-facing changes
- Documentation updates only
- Non-code teams (Command, DNS, Finance, Medical, Legal)
- Configuration changes with NO UI impact
- **PRE-CANCEL CONDITION:** Add subitem but cancel it immediately with reason "no UX/UI surface in diff" when you are certain the project does NOT modify any user-facing interface

**CRITICAL: Protected Subitem Governance for [UX]**

The `[UX]` tag designates UX/UI Evaluation as a **protected subitem** — it is a merge gate, equivalent to `[Review]` and `[Test]` subitems. This means:

1. **Agents CANNOT cancel [UX] subitems** unless:
   - The subitem was created with reason "no UX/UI surface in diff" at planning time (pre-cancelled)
   - OR the user explicitly approves cancellation

2. **Why the exception exists for "no UX/UI surface":**
   - A bot cannot accurately judge UX impact at planning time without analyzing the full PR diff
   - However, deferring the judgment to PR creation would force all projects to include the subitem
   - Solution: pre-cancel at planning if you are confident (based on project description) that no UI surfaces will be touched
   - The PR auto-merge loop implements a Layer 2 backstop heuristic (XACA-0703) that re-opens the cancelled [UX] subitem if the diff matches known UI-touching patterns — preventing false negatives

3. **Why this is the ONLY sanctioned exception:**
   - `[Review]` and `[Test]` subitems represent committed work that agents MUST complete (no cancellation except user approval)
   - `[UX]` has a principled two-layer design: planner intent + heuristic backstop
   - Allowing agents to cancel [UX] subitems outside the "no UX/UI surface" class would undermine the merge gate
   - See docs/ux-eval-gate.md for the full two-layer design and heuristic backstop implementation

4. **When assigning the subitem:**
   - If UI-touching: assign to the team's UX Expert (from routing table above)
   - If pre-cancelled: mark it done with reason "no UX/UI surface in diff"
   - The backstop will re-open it if the diff later contradicts the cancellation

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Retrospective and Knowledge Capture Subitem for All Projects**

Every project MUST include a dedicated **"Retrospective and Knowledge Capture"** subitem as the second-to-last step. This is NOT optional for code projects. Non-code teams and non-code projects are technically exempt but strongly encouraged to include it.

**Subagent Prompt Requirements for Knowledge Capture:**

When any project subitem is delegated to a subagent via the Task tool, the subagent
prompt MUST include the following sections in this order:

1. **Task Identity** (kanban item, subitem, goal)
2. **Worktree Context** (if applicable — with explicit "DO NOT switch branches" warning)
3. **Subitem Tracking Commands** (`kb-backlog sub start/done`)
4. **⛔ FORBIDDEN ACTIONS** — The load-bearing perimeter block
5. **Work Instructions** (clear steps and acceptance criteria)
6. **Lessons Learned** instruction (below)
7. **MANDATORY FINAL STEP** (crew avatar removal)

### ⛔ FORBIDDEN ACTIONS Block (MANDATORY for All Subagent Prompts)

Every subagent prompt MUST include a clearly-visible ⛔ FORBIDDEN ACTIONS block near the top (after task identity, before work instructions). This block has measurably reduced subagent scope drift and unsafe shortcuts (XACA-0222, XACA-0239).

**Universal Forbidden Actions (Always Include):**
```
⛔ FORBIDDEN ACTIONS — Do not do these:
  ⛔ Do not check out develop or master
  ⛔ Do not switch branches (worktree lock violation)
  ⛔ Do not run git worktree remove, git worktree prune, or delete worktree directories
  ⛔ Do not modify files outside the named scope for this subitem
  ⛔ Do not refactor unrelated code "while you're here" — expand scope only with explicit instruction
  ⛔ Do not skip lint or tests when the parent task includes them
  ⛔ Do not include secrets, credentials, API keys, or PII in any artifact (output, files, comments)
  ⛔ Do not bypass --no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, or skip git hooks
```

**Task-Specific Additions (Add 1–2 items per delegation):**
Examples:
- ⛔ Do not edit anything in `<team>/` directory (team boundary violation)
- ⛔ Do not modify `<unrelated-file>` — out of scope for this subitem
- ⛔ Do not run xcodegen (overwrites manual config; needs user approval)
- ⛔ Do not commit directly to develop (use feature branch, open PR)

**Why This Is Mandatory:** Subagents start cold and pattern-match the prompt. Without an explicit perimeter, they drift toward refactoring, shortcut commands, and scope expansion. The block must be visible (emoji + list form) and scannable — burying it reduces compliance. See XACA-0239 and `~/knowledge/templates/subagent_prompt_template.md` for complete guidance.

### Lessons Learned Instruction (MANDATORY for All Subagent Prompts)

The subagent prompt MUST include this instruction at the end (before the LCARS cleanup instruction):

```
Before returning your output, include a "Lessons Learned" section at the end with:
- Any technical lessons, gotchas, or surprising behaviors you encountered
- Mistakes you made or nearly made and how you caught them
- Patterns or approaches that worked particularly well
- Anything a future agent doing similar work should know
Keep it brief (3-7 bullet points). The implementing agent will extract these during
the retrospective step.
```

This is required so the implementing agent has source material for subagent lessons
when creating the retrospective document. Without it, subagent lessons are lost when
the Task completes.

**🚨 MANDATORY: Retrospective Subitem Delegation Prompt**

When delegating the "Retrospective and Knowledge Capture" subitem to a subagent via the Task tool, the delegation prompt MUST include:

1. The universal ⛔ FORBIDDEN ACTIONS block (from the section above)
2. Task-specific forbidden actions (e.g., "Do not edit knowledge-base entries that belong to other agents")
3. These specific retrospective-file creation instructions (in addition to the standard "Lessons Learned" instruction):

The instructions must include:

````
## CRITICAL: Retrospective File Creation (MANDATORY)

You MUST create a retrospective FILE. Knowledge entries alone are NOT sufficient.

Steps:
1. Get the retrospective file path:
   RETRO_PATH=$(source ~/dev-team/kanban-helpers.sh && kb-retro-path <ITEM-ID>)
2. Copy the template:
   cp ~/knowledge/templates/retrospective_template.md "$RETRO_PATH"
3. Fill in ALL sections of the retrospective document
4. Create knowledge entries (separate files in the knowledge directory)
5. The `kb-backlog sub done` command will BLOCK completion if the retro file is missing

⛔ DO NOT skip creating the retrospective file
⛔ DO NOT confuse knowledge entries with the retrospective document — they are DIFFERENT things
⛔ The retrospective file MUST exist at the path returned by kb-retro-path
````

**Why This Is Mandatory:**
Agents delegated the retrospective subitem have historically focused on knowledge entries (which they understand well) while skipping the retrospective file (which they don't realize is a separate, mandatory artifact). This explicit prompt template ensures the subagent knows both are required. The `kb-backlog sub done` command enforces this — it will refuse to mark the subitem complete if the retrospective file is missing.

**When Retrospective and Knowledge Capture subitem is required:**
- New feature implementation
- Bug fixes
- Refactoring existing code
- API changes
- UI/UX modifications
- Performance improvements
- Any project that involves code changes in a git repository

**When Retrospective and Knowledge Capture subitem may be skipped:**
- See [Project-Level Exceptions](#project-level-exceptions) below

**Note for non-code projects:** Even when technically exempt, non-code projects (planning, documentation, infrastructure design, strategy) are strongly encouraged to include the Retrospective subitem. Lessons about planning, communication, scope estimation, and coordination are just as valuable as technical lessons.

**🚨 MANDATORY: Cross-Agent Retrospective Review**

The retrospective is NOT a single-agent activity. Every agent who contributed to a project — planner, implementer, reviewer, subagent — should review the retrospective and extract knowledge relevant to their own domain.

**How to Run Cross-Agent Review for Subagents:**

Subagents spawned via the Task tool are ephemeral — they don't persist after returning.
To give them the opportunity to review the retrospective, the **implementing agent**
re-spawns each unique subagent type after writing the retrospective document:

```
For each unique subagent_type in the Delegation Map:

1. Spawn a Task with that subagent_type
2. Provide the full retrospective document content in the prompt
3. Tell the subagent:
   - "Review this retrospective for lessons relevant to YOUR domain"
   - "If you find genuine lessons, write knowledge entries to YOUR
     knowledge directory (primary + backup) and update YOUR INDEX.md"
   - "If nothing is relevant to your domain, reply with 'No entries —
     reviewed, nothing applicable' so I can mark you as reviewed"
   - Provide the agent's knowledge directory paths
4. Record the result in the Cross-Agent Review table
```

For **non-subagent involved parties** (planning agent, reviewer) who run in separate
terminals, the implementing agent should note their names in the Cross-Agent Review
table as "Pending" — those agents review the retrospective in their own sessions.

**Pre-Project Knowledge Review (reinforcement):** Before beginning work on any new project, agents SHOULD read both their personal `INDEX.md` and their team's `project/INDEX.md`. This is specified in each agent's persona under "Knowledge Base," and is reinforced here. Use the Tag Index in both files to surface entries relevant to the current work area. This review should happen before Phase 1 (Requirements Analysis) or at the very start of implementation — not after.

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Sync Local Develop Branch Subitem**

Every code-related project MUST include a dedicated **"Sync Local Develop Branch"** subitem as the very last step. This ensures the local develop branch is fully up-to-date after the PR merges, preventing stale branch issues for subsequent work.

### Project-Level Exceptions

Not all teams and projects produce code, and not all code projects touch user-facing interfaces. The mandatory trailing subitems (Testing & Debugging, PR Creation & Test Handoff, QA Testing & Code Review, UX/UI Evaluation, Retrospective and Knowledge Capture, Sync Local Develop Branch) apply **only to projects that involve code changes in a git repository**. UX/UI Evaluation is conditional on touching a user-facing interface. The Retrospective and Sync subitems follow the same exception rules as Testing & PR, but even exempt projects are encouraged to include them.

**Quick Reference — Which Subitems Does My Project Need?**

| Scenario | Testing & Debugging | PR Creation & Test Handoff | QA Testing & Code Review | [UX] UX/UI Eval | Retrospective | Sync Develop |
|----------|:-------------------:|:--------------------------:|:------------------------:|:---------------:|:-------------:|:------------:|
| Code project on code team (UI-touching, worktree) | **REQUIRED** | **REQUIRED** | **REQUIRED** | **REQUIRED** | **REQUIRED** | **REQUIRED** |
| Code project on code team (non-UI, worktree) | **REQUIRED** | **REQUIRED** | **REQUIRED** | Skip/Cancel | **REQUIRED** | **REQUIRED** |
| Code project on code team (UI-touching, direct to develop) | **REQUIRED** | Skip | Skip | **REQUIRED** | **REQUIRED** | **REQUIRED** |
| Code project on code team (non-UI, direct to develop) | **REQUIRED** | Skip | Skip | Skip | **REQUIRED** | **REQUIRED** |
| Non-code project on code team (docs, assets) | Skip | Skip | Skip | Skip | Encouraged | Skip |

| Legal team (XLCP) — any project | Skip | Skip | Skip | Skip | Encouraged | Skip |
| Config-only changes (non-code) | Skip | Skip | Skip | Skip | Encouraged | Skip |
| Planning/research with no code output | Skip | Skip | Skip | Skip | Encouraged | Skip |

**Decision Flow:**

```
Is this a code-related project?
├── NO → Skip Testing, PR, QA, UX, and Sync mandatory subitems
│         (docs, assets, planning, strategy, Command/Legal/DNS teams)
│         → Retrospective is encouraged but not required
│
└── YES → Does the team maintain a code repository?
    ├── NO → Skip Testing, PR, QA, UX, and Sync mandatory subitems
    │         (Command/XCMD, Legal/XLCP, DNS/XDNS, etc.)
    │         → Retrospective is encouraged but not required
    │
    └── YES → Will changes go through a PR?
        ├── YES → ALL SIX subitems required (UI-touching projects)
        │          (Testing + PR Handoff + QA Review + UX + Retrospective + Sync)
        │          (worktree work, feature branches, UI changes)
        │
        ├── SOME UI → Testing + PR Handoff + QA Review REQUIRED
        │              UX subitem REQUIRED (if UI-touching)
        │              Retrospective + Sync REQUIRED
        │
        └── NO (direct-to-develop) → Testing subitem REQUIRED
                  PR Handoff and QA Review skipped
                  UX subitem REQUIRED (if UI-touching, even direct-to-develop)
                  Retrospective subitem REQUIRED
                  Sync Local Develop Branch subitem REQUIRED
                  (minor fixes direct to develop, not in worktree)
```

### Phase 5: Plan Document Creation (MANDATORY)

**⚠️ This phase is REQUIRED. Do NOT skip to the handoff checkpoint without completing this phase.**

Create a comprehensive plan document following the template below.

**Location:** `<team-kanban>/<ITEM-ID>_<10-30_char_description>.md`

⚠️ **CRITICAL: Use the correct team kanban directory based on the item prefix!**
- See [Plan Document Path Resolution](#plan-document-path-resolution) for the full mapping
- NEVER put non-Academy (non-XACA) plan docs in `~/dev-team/kanban/`

**Naming Convention:**
- Use the ITEM-ID exactly as assigned (e.g., `XACA-0031`)
- Description should be 10-30 characters, lowercase, underscores for spaces
- Determine the correct team directory from the prefix

**Examples by Team (each in their OWN kanban directory):**
- Academy: `~/dev-team/kanban/XACA-0031_dark_mode_support.md`
- iOS: `<ios-repo>/kanban/XIOS-0042_payment_refactor.md`
- Firebase: `<firebase-repo>/kanban/XFIR-0055_account_api.md`
- Freelance: `.../Starwords/kanban/XFSW-0020_setup_wizard.md`

**Minimum Content Requirements:**

Every plan document MUST include:
0. ✅ **Canonical marker** (HTML comment `<!-- plan_doc: canonical -->` on line 1, above the H1)
1. ✅ **Header metadata** (Status, Priority, Tags, Created date, Team)
2. ✅ **Summary** (2-4 sentences describing the project)
3. ✅ **Requirements** (numbered list of what must be accomplished)
4. ✅ **Design Decisions** (at least one architectural/implementation decision)
5. ✅ **Files to Modify** (specific file paths, not generic descriptions)
6. ✅ **Implementation Order** (phased steps matching subitems)
7. ✅ **Subitems Table** (all subitems with IDs and status)
8. ✅ **Verification Checklist** (testable acceptance criteria)

> **Marker Convention (XACA-0478):** The `<!-- plan_doc: canonical -->` marker on line 1 lets `kb-retro-path` distinguish the canonical plan doc from side-docs (audit reports, SPECs, instruction files, feasibility notes) when `kanban/plans/<ID>/` contains multiple plan-adjacent files. The marker is invisible in GitHub Markdown, Confluence, and the LCARS UI plan viewer (per CommonMark HTML-comment stripping). **Side-docs MUST NOT carry this marker** — that is what makes the resolver pick correctly. Only the one canonical plan doc per item gets the marker.

**Template:**

```markdown
<!-- plan_doc: canonical -->
# <ITEM-ID>: <Title>

**Status:** Planning Complete
**Priority:** <Critical | High | Medium | Low>
**Tags:** <comma-separated tags>
**Created:** <YYYY-MM-DD>
**Team:** <Team Name>

## Notes

<Additional context, dependencies, risks, or considerations>

---

*Plan created by <Agent Name> - <Role>*
```

### Phase 5b: Plan Document Verification (MANDATORY)

After writing the plan document, you MUST verify it was created successfully:

```bash
# Get the correct team directory for this item
PLAN_DIR=$(get_plan_doc_dir "<ITEM-ID>")

# Verify the plan document exists in the CORRECT team directory
ls "$PLAN_DIR/<ITEM-ID>_"*.md
```

**Verification Checklist (internal - do not display to user):**
- [ ] File exists at the CORRECT team-specific kanban/ path
- [ ] File contains all 8 required sections
- [ ] Subitems table matches created subitems
- [ ] File paths are specific (not generic placeholders)
- [ ] Verification checklist has at least 3 testable items

**If verification fails:**
1. Report the specific failure to the user
2. Attempt to create/fix the plan document
3. Re-verify before proceeding

**DO NOT display the handoff checkpoint until verification passes.**

### Phase 6: Handoff Checkpoint

Display the completion banner and wait for user instruction.

**DO NOT proceed to implementation without explicit user choice.**

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 PROJECT PLANNING COMPLETE - READY FOR HANDOFF
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

 Created Artifacts:
   Kanban Item:  XACA-0031 "LCARS Fleet Monitor Dark Mode"
   Subitems:     11 implementation phases
   Plan Doc:     ~/dev-team/kanban/XACA-0031_dark_mode_support.md
   Priority:     Medium
   Tags:         feature, ui, accessibility

 How would you like to proceed?

   1. DELEGATE - Assign to another agent/terminal
      Specify which team or terminal should work on this

   2. START NOW - I'll begin working on the first subitem
      Only choose this if you want ME to implement

   3. TRACK ONLY - Add to backlog, work on it later
      Item is ready whenever you want to start

   4. MODIFY PLAN - Adjust subitems or scope before proceeding
      I can add, remove, or reorder implementation phases

## Integration with Kanban Manager

This skill uses the Kanban Manager skill commands:

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Create item | `kb-backlog add` |
| Add subitem | `kb-backlog sub add` |
| Set priority | `kb-backlog priority` |
| Set effort estimate | `kb-backlog points <id> <hours>` (required before start) |
| List unestimated | `kb-backlog unestimated` |
| Add tags | `kb-backlog tag` |
| Set due date | `kb-backlog due` |
| Link JIRA | `kb-backlog jira` |

**Always source helpers first:**
```bash
source ~/dev-team/kanban-helpers.sh && <command>
```

---

## Team Detection

The skill auto-detects the target team from:

1. Explicit specification: `/plan-project [ios] ...`
2. Environment variable: `$LCARS_TEAM`
3. Terminal name mapping
4. Working directory context

**Valid teams:** `ios`, `android`, `firebase`, `academy`, `command`, `dns`, `freelance`, `mainevent`

---

## Plan Document Path Resolution

⚠️ **CRITICAL: Each team has its OWN kanban directory in their repository.**

Plan documents MUST be stored in the owning team's `kanban/` directory, NOT in a central location or subdirectory of another team's repo.

### Repository-Based Path Mapping

Each project has its own git repository. The item ID prefix determines which repo's kanban/ directory to use:

#### Dev Teams

| Prefix | Team | Kanban Directory |
|--------|------|------------------|
| `XACA-` | Academy | `~/dev-team/kanban/` |
| `XIOS-` | iOS | `<ios-repo>/kanban/` |
| `XAND-` | Android | `<android-repo>/kanban/` |
| `XFIR-` | Firebase | `<firebase-repo>/kanban/` |
| `XCMD-` | Command | `<command-repo>/kanban/` |
| `XDNS-` | DNS | `/Users/Shared/Development/DNSFramework/kanban/` |

#### Freelance Projects (Each project has its own repo)

| Prefix | Project | Kanban Directory |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| `XFSW-` | Starwords | `/Users/Shared/Development/DoubleNode/Starwords/kanban/` |
| `XFAP-` | AppPlanning | `/Users/Shared/Development/DoubleNode/appPlanning/kanban/` |
| `XFWS-` | WorkStats | `/Users/Shared/Development/DoubleNode/WorkStats/kanban/` |

#### Legal Projects

| Prefix | Project | Kanban Directory |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| `XLCP-` | CoParenting | `~/legal/coparenting/kanban/` |

### Key Principle

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  EVERY team has its own kanban directory in their repository:              │
│                                                                             │
│  <repo-root>/                                                               │
│  └── kanban/               ← All kanban files go HERE                       │
│      ├── <team>-board.json                                                  │
│      ├── <ITEM-ID>_<description>.md  (plan docs)                            │
│      └── releases/<release-id>/manifest.json                                │
│                                                                             │
│  ⛔ NEVER put another team's files in YOUR repo's kanban/                   │
│  ⛔ NEVER create team subdirectories (ios/, firebase/, etc.) in kanban/     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Path Resolution Logic

When creating a plan document:

1. **Extract the prefix** from the ITEM-ID (e.g., `XIOS-0042` → `XIOS`)
2. **Look up the team's kanban directory** using the mapping table above
3. **Construct the full path**: `<team-kanban>/<ITEM-ID>_<description>.md`
4. **Ensure directory exists** before writing (create if needed)

### Bash Helper for Path Resolution

```bash
# Function to get plan doc directory from item ID
get_plan_doc_dir() {
    local item_id="$1"
    local prefix="${item_id%%-*}"  # Extract prefix before first hyphen

    case "$prefix" in
        # Dev Teams (set IOS_REPO, ANDROID_REPO, FIREBASE_REPO env vars for your layout)
        XACA) echo "$HOME/dev-team/kanban" ;;
        XIOS) echo "${IOS_REPO:-/path/to/ios-repo}/kanban" ;;
        XAND) echo "${ANDROID_REPO:-/path/to/android-repo}/kanban" ;;
        XFIR) echo "${FIREBASE_REPO:-/path/to/firebase-repo}/kanban" ;;
        XCMD) echo "${COMMAND_REPO:-/path/to/command-repo}/kanban" ;;
        XDNS) echo "/Users/Shared/Development/DNSFramework/kanban" ;;

        # Freelance Projects (each project has its own repo)
        XFSW) echo "/Users/Shared/Development/DoubleNode/Starwords/kanban" ;;
        XFAP) echo "/Users/Shared/Development/DoubleNode/appPlanning/kanban" ;;
        XFWS) echo "/Users/Shared/Development/DoubleNode/WorkStats/kanban" ;;

        # Legal Projects
        XLCP) echo "$HOME/legal/coparenting/kanban" ;;

        *) echo "$HOME/dev-team/kanban" ;;  # Default fallback to Academy
    esac
}

# Usage example
ITEM_ID="XIOS-0042"
PLAN_DIR=$(get_plan_doc_dir "$ITEM_ID")
mkdir -p "$PLAN_DIR"
echo "Plan doc path: $PLAN_DIR/${ITEM_ID}_description.md"
```

### Why Separate Repositories?

1. **Team ownership** - Each team manages their own git history and planning documents
2. **Independent deployments** - Teams can release without affecting others
3. **Access control** - Repository permissions are per-team
4. **Code reviews** - PRs stay within team boundaries
5. **Scalability** - Each repo stays focused and manageable

### Directory Creation

If a team's `kanban/` directory doesn't exist, create it before writing:

```bash
PLAN_DIR=$(get_plan_doc_dir "$ITEM_ID")
mkdir -p "$PLAN_DIR"
```

---

## Error Handling

### No Clear Requirements

If the project description is too vague:

```
I need more information to create a comprehensive plan.

Please clarify:
- What specific functionality should this include?
- Are there any constraints or requirements?
- What's the expected scope (small fix vs. large feature)?
```

### Cross-Team Work

If the project spans multiple teams:

```
This project involves multiple teams:
- iOS: <component>
- Firebase: <component>

I'll create the plan for the [primary team] board.
Cross-team coordination items will be noted in the plan document.
```

---

## Retroactive Plan Document Creation

If a kanban item was created WITHOUT a plan document (e.g., via direct `kb-backlog add`), you should create the plan document retroactively.

**When to Create Retroactive Plan Docs:**
- Item exists in backlog but no plan doc exists in the team's `kanban/` directory
- Item has subitems but no plan document
- User asks to "document" or "plan" an existing item

**Process:**
1. Read the existing item details: `kb-backlog show <item-id>`
2. List existing subitems: `kb-backlog sub list <item-id>`
3. **Determine the correct team directory** using [Plan Document Path Resolution](#plan-document-path-resolution)
4. Research the codebase for context
5. Create the plan document in the **team-specific directory**
6. Verify document creation

**Command to check for missing plan docs (project-aware):**
```bash
# Function to get plan doc directory from item ID
get_plan_doc_dir() {
    local item_id="$1"

## Best Practices

### Subitem Granularity

**Too coarse (bad):**
- "Implement the feature"
- "Write all the code"

**Too fine (bad):**
- "Create file header"
- "Add import statement"
- "Define first variable"

**Just right (good):**
- "Create data model and schema"
- "Implement API endpoints"
- "Build UI components"
- "Add error handling"
- "Write unit tests"

### Plan Document Quality

Include enough detail that:
- Another developer can implement without asking questions
- Design decisions are documented with rationale
- File paths are specific and accurate
- Verification checklist covers all requirements

## Version History

**v1.11.0** (June 15, 2026)
- **XACA-0703 UX/UI Evaluation quality gate (third merge gate)** - Added `[UX] UX/UI Evaluation` as a new protected subitem (merge gate, same as `[Review]`/`[Test]`)
- Added conditional UX subitem requirement: REQUIRED for UI-touching projects, MAY be skipped or pre-cancelled for non-UI projects
- Implemented two-layer UX gate design: Layer 1 (planner intent at creation), Layer 2 (PR auto-merge backstop heuristic to re-open prematurely cancelled [UX])
- Added sanctioned auto-cancel exception: `[UX]` is the ONLY protected subitem agents may pre-cancel (with reason "no UX/UI surface in diff"), all others require user approval
- Updated mandatory trailing subitem ordering from 5 to 6: Testing, PR Handoff, QA Review, **[UX] UX/UI Evaluation**, Retrospective, Sync
- Added UX Expert routing table (wesley/uhura/quark/paris-me/mayweather/lal per team) with routing guidance
- Updated exception rules with new EXCEPTION 3 (Non-UI Code Projects) to clarify when [UX] can be skipped or pre-cancelled
- Updated Project-Level Exceptions section to explain auto-cancel condition and Layer 2 backstop
- Added explicit governance section on protected subitem rules for [UX], clarifying it is NEVER cancelled except by user approval (except the no-UI-surface pre-cancel condition)
- Updated quick reference table to show [UX] requirement per UI-touching scenarios
- Updated decision flow to incorporate UI/non-UI branching
- Updated plan document template subitems table to include [UX] in mandatory trailing subitems
- Updated mandatory checklist to include [UX] verification
- See docs/ux-eval-gate.md for complete design, routing table, UI surface heuristic patterns, and two-layer detection

**v1.12.0** (July 13, 2026)
- **ATTACH MODE: Planning against existing items** - Added explicit mode for planning against items that already exist but have zero subitems, preventing duplicate item creation
- **ATTACH MODE skips Phase 0 and Phase 3** - Container selection and kanban item creation are skipped (item already exists); Phases 1, 2, 4, 5 run normally
- **ATTACH MODE guard condition** - Reports and stops if the item already has subitems (plan already exists or item was modified externally)
- **Protected subitem governance in ATTACH MODE** - Mandatory `[Review]`, `[Test]`, `[UX]` trailing subitems still emit, preserving merge gate dependencies
- **ATTACH MODE preserves handoff checkpoint** - Still stops at the explicit handoff option display (plan approval ≠ execution approval)
- Added [ATTACH MODE](#attach-mode-planning-against-existing-items) section with full mode documentation, phase-by-phase decisions, invocation syntax, and guard conditions
- Added cross-reference from Phase 0 Container Selection to ATTACH MODE section
- Invoked via: `/plan-project --attach <ITEM-ID>` or from auto-planning-gate prompts

**v1.10.1** (April 26, 2026)
- **XACA-0222 Four-Tier Knowledge Schema Integration** - Updated all knowledge path references to reflect the new portable four-tier schema (agent/team/subject/project tiers)
- Replaced legacy `<repo-kanban>/knowledge/<codename>/` paths with agent-tier: `~/knowledge/agents/<persona>/`
- Replaced legacy team-domain guidance with subject-tier (`~/knowledge/subjects/<topic>/`) and project-tier (`<repo>/kanban/knowledge/project/`)
- Updated Retrospective subitem box to use `kb-knowledge-add` tool for scaffolding entries instead of manual mkdir
- Replaced XACA-0084 design doc reference with authoritative sources: `~/knowledge/SPEC.md` (schema contract) and `~/knowledge/docs/USAGE.md` (daily operations)
- Updated knowledge entry naming to reflect new prefixes: `k###` (agent), `s###` (subject), `p###` (project)
- Team tier (`t###`) is reserved for future use; currently all team-domain knowledge maps to subject or project tiers per context

**v1.10.0** (March 18, 2026)
- **MANDATORY Retrospective delegation prompt template** - Added explicit delegation prompt template for the "Retrospective and Knowledge Capture" subitem that agents MUST include when delegating via the Task tool
- Ensures subagents create the retrospective FILE (not just knowledge entries)
- Addresses root cause: delegation prompts previously lacked explicit retrospective file creation requirements, causing subagents to skip the mandatory retrospective document
- `kb-backlog sub done` now blocks completion if retro file is missing (enforced in kanban-helpers.sh)

**v1.9.0** (March 2, 2026)
- **Review & Test Subitem Governance** - Added protected subitem classification rules for `[Review]` and `[Test]` tagged subitems
- Agents CANNOT cancel `[Review]` or `[Test]` subitems without explicit user approval — these represent real committed work items, not optional suggestions
- Three-tier classification table added: Standard (agent can cancel with reason), Protected (requires user approval), Mandatory (requires user approval)
- Clarifies that "cancelled with a reason" is NOT equivalent to "completed" — cancellation cannot be used as a shortcut to avoid review/test work
- Section added to Critical Behavior Rules to ensure agents encounter this governance early in the skill

**v1.8.0** (February 26, 2026)
- **MANDATORY Sync Local Develop Branch subitem** - All code-related projects now require a Sync Local Develop Branch subitem as the very last step, ensuring local develop is fully up-to-date after PR merge
- **Mandatory trailing subitem ordering updated** - Now FIVE trailing subitems: Testing & Debugging, PR Creation & Test Handoff, QA Testing & Code Review, Retrospective and Knowledge Capture, Sync Local Develop Branch
- Updated ordering box, quick reference table, decision flow, example workflow (11 subitems), plan document template, and mandatory checklist to reflect five trailing subitems
- Exception rules updated: direct-to-develop changes still require Sync subitem; non-code projects exempt from Sync

**v1.7.0** (February 26, 2026)
- **MANDATORY QA Testing & Code Review subitem** - All code-related projects now require a dedicated QA Testing & Code Review subitem as a formal testing gate between PR creation and retrospective
- **Renamed "PR Creation & Review" to "PR Creation & Test Handoff"** - The PR creation subitem now focuses on creating the PR, generating the test handoff prompt, and entering the test + review monitoring loops
- **QA Testing & Code Review subitem** covers: QA tester runs unit tests, lint validation, integration tests, and validates edge cases; QA tester submits via gh-bot-test; code reviewer performs standard checklist and submits via gh-bot-review; creating agent merges on both approvals
- **Mandatory trailing subitem ordering updated** - Now FOUR trailing subitems: Testing & Debugging (fourth-to-last), PR Creation & Test Handoff (third-to-last), QA Testing & Code Review (second-to-last), Retrospective and Knowledge Capture (always last)
- Updated ordering box from three to four mandatory trailing subitems
- **Exception rules updated** - Direct-to-develop exception now skips BOTH PR Handoff AND QA Review subitems (not just PR); non-code team/project exceptions updated to reference "four" subitems
- Updated plan document template subitems table to include all four mandatory trailing subitems
- Updated example workflow to show 10 subitems (including all four mandatory trailing subitems)
- Updated Quick Reference table to include QA Testing & Code Review column
- Updated decision flow to incorporate QA Testing & Code Review requirement
- Updated quick reference checklist to include QA Testing & Code Review subitem verification

**v1.6.0** (February 20, 2026)
- **Knowledge directory migration** - Updated all knowledge path references to reflect XACA-0089 migration: knowledge directories moved from `~/dev-team/<team>/knowledge/` to `<repo-kanban>/knowledge/`. `~/.claude/knowledge/<codename>/` entries are now symlinks to primary locations — no dual-write or backup mirroring required
- **Removed backup mirror instructions** - Retrospective subitem no longer instructs agents to mirror entries to `~/.claude/knowledge/`. The symlinks created by XACA-0089 handle this automatically
- **Updated TEMPLATES path** - Template reference updated from `~/dev-team/academy/knowledge/TEMPLATES/` to `~/knowledge/templates/`

**v1.5.3** (February 19, 2026)
- **Security: NO SECRETS in knowledge files** - Added explicit prohibition in Retrospective subitem box: never include secrets, credentials, or PII in knowledge entries or retrospective documents
- **Corrected claude backup paths** - Fixed backup location references from `~/dev-team/claude/knowledge/` to `~/.claude/knowledge/` throughout (including version history entries and subitem box)

**v1.5.2** (February 19, 2026)
- **Retrospective document creation** - The Retrospective subitem now requires creating a project retrospective document at `<kanban-dir>/<ITEM-ID>_<desc>_RETROSPECTIVE.md` using the template at `~/knowledge/templates/retrospective_template.md`
- **Subagent knowledge extraction** - Retrospective subitem now explicitly covers reviewing all subagent Task outputs for "Lessons Learned" sections and extracting lessons during the retrospective step
- **Subagent prompt requirements** - Added mandatory "Lessons Learned" instruction that must be included in every subagent prompt when delegating subitems via the Task tool
- **Multi-role categorization guidance** - Retrospective subitem references Section 12 of the design doc for how to categorize subagent-sourced lessons (agent vs. team knowledge)
- **Retrospective doc knowledge table** - Added step to fill in the "Knowledge Entries Created" table in the retrospective doc after writing all entries
- Updated retrospective subitem box with new steps and prohibition line for skipping the retro doc
- References updated design document Sections 12 (Subagent Knowledge) and 13 (Retrospective Document)

**v1.5.1** (February 19, 2026)
- **Team-level knowledge categorization in Retrospective subitem** - Agents now categorize each lesson as agent-specific or team domain during the retrospective process
- Agent-specific lessons go to `<repo-kanban>/knowledge/<codename>/`; team domain lessons go to `<repo-kanban>/knowledge/TEAM/`; a single lesson CAN be written to both if it has both personal and team-wide implications
- **Claude backup updated for team entries** - Team domain entries mirror to `~/.claude/knowledge/team-<teamname>/` (not just the agent backup) (Note: as of v1.6.0, these are symlinks — no dual-write required)
- **Pre-project knowledge review reinforced** - Added explicit note that agents SHOULD read both their personal INDEX.md and the team project/INDEX.md before beginning any new project
- Updated Retrospective subitem box with categorization step and new backup paths
- Updated prohibition line to cover all appropriate locations (not just "BOTH")
- References updated design document sections (Sections 10 and 11) for team knowledge and curation guidance

**v1.5.0** (February 19, 2026)
- **MANDATORY Retrospective and Knowledge Capture subitem** - All code-related projects now require a dedicated Retrospective and Knowledge Capture subitem as the final step
- Retrospective subitem covers: reviewing kanban item and git history, reviewing PR comments, writing a knowledge entry to primary knowledge dir (`<repo-kanban>/knowledge/<codename>/`), updating INDEX.md, and marking the subitem done
- References `~/dev-team/kanban/XACA-0084_knowledge_base_design.md` for full process details, file templates, and agent-to-directory mapping
- **Mandatory trailing subitem ordering updated** - Now THREE trailing subitems: Testing & Debugging (third-to-last), PR Creation & Review (second-to-last), Retrospective and Knowledge Capture (always last)
- Updated ordering box from two to three mandatory trailing subitems
- **Exception rules updated** - Retrospective follows the same exception rules as Testing & PR. Non-code teams (Command/XCMD, Legal/XLCP) and non-code projects are technically exempt. However, even exempt projects are encouraged to include retrospectives since lessons about planning and coordination are valuable regardless of whether code was produced
- Updated plan document template subitems table to include Retrospective as mandatory last subitem
- Updated example workflow to show 9 subitems (including all three mandatory trailing subitems)
- Updated quick reference checklist to include Retrospective subitem verification
- Updated Quick Reference table to include Retrospective column
- Updated decision flow to incorporate Retrospective requirement

**v1.4.0** (February 14, 2026)
- **MANDATORY PR Creation & Review subitem** - All code-related projects now require a dedicated PR Creation & Review subitem
- PR subitem covers: branch push, PR creation targeting develop, review handoff prompt generation, bot approval monitoring, merge after approval, kanban status update
- Follows the full PR Review Workflow defined in CLAUDE.md (gh-bot-review, --admin merge, cross-terminal review)
- **Mandatory trailing subitem ordering** - Testing & Debugging is second-to-last, PR Creation & Review is always last
- Ensures all code is tested and lint-clean before PR is opened
- **Project-Level Exceptions** - Clear exception rules for when mandatory subitems may be skipped:
  - Non-code teams (Command/XCMD, Legal/XLCP) exempt from both subitems
  - Non-code projects on code teams (docs, assets, planning) exempt from both subitems
  - Direct-to-develop changes exempt from PR subitem only (Testing still required for code)
- Added decision flow chart and quick-reference table for subitem requirements
- Updated plan document template to include both mandatory trailing subitems
- Updated example workflow to show 8 subitems (including both mandatory subitems)
- Updated quick reference checklist with PR subitem verification and exception check

**v1.3.0** (February 2, 2026)
- **MANDATORY Testing/Debugging subitem** - All code-related projects now require a dedicated Testing & Debugging subitem
- Added detailed guidance on what testing subitem should include (unit tests, integration, lint validation, etc.)
- Updated mandatory checklist to include testing subitem verification
- Updated example workflow to show testing subitem as standard practice
- Updated plan document template to include testing subitem note
- Clarified when testing subitem can be skipped (docs-only, config, assets)

**v1.2.0** (January 26, 2026)
- **Repository-based plan document storage** - Each project has its own kanban/ directory
- Added [Plan Document Path Resolution](#plan-document-path-resolution) section with project-to-repo mapping
- Added bash helper function `get_plan_doc_dir()` for repo path resolution
- Updated all examples to show correct repository paths
- Updated verification commands to check correct project repository
- Updated quick reference checklist with repository mapping
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Plan docs go in the PROJECT'S REPOSITORY, not subdirectories of another repo
- **Mobile teams**: Academy, iOS, Android, Firebase (separate repos)
