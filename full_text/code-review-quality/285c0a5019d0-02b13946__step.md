name: step
description: Automated PR review loop. Run /loop /pr-autopilot:step <PR#> after creating a PR; the skill fetches reviews from enabled reviewers, applies fixes or pushes back with reasoning, pushes commits, and waits for re-review. Stops when all enabled per-iteration reviewers report success (default: Cursor score 5/5 + Copilot final-pass 0 unresolved). Ten independent safety stops. Use when - "automate my PR review", "loop until merge-ready", "fix PR review comments automatically".

# /pr-autopilot:step <PR_NUMBER>

One iteration of the PR review→fix loop. Invoked by `/loop` (Claude Code's dynamic-mode loop driver). Returns by either:

- Calling `ScheduleWakeup(delaySeconds=90, prompt="/loop /pr-autopilot:step <PR_NUMBER>", reason="polling for reviewer re-review")` to continue the loop
- Omitting the `ScheduleWakeup` call to terminate the loop

## Required tools on user machine

- `gh` (GitHub CLI, authenticated)
- `jq` (JSON processor)
- `git`

## Configuration

Read from `~/.claude/settings.json` under `prAutopilot`. Defaults if missing:

```json
{
  "prAutopilot": {
    "pollIntervalSeconds": 90,
    "fixIterationCap": 5,
    "pollTickCap": 10,

}
```

**Auto-merge config (v0.4):** `prAutopilot.autoMerge` tunes the *target* + *method* guards for `safeAutoMerge` (see §"Auto-merge"). Safe hardcoded defaults shown above — it works with zero config. The per-repo **opt-in itself is file-based** (`~/.pr-autopilot/automerge-repos`, separate from v0.3's `allowed-repos`); absent ⇒ auto-merge OFF everywhere; the notify-and-stop control flow is unchanged from v0.3 (the notification just adds a "merge manually" hint).

## Config → algorithm derivation

| Config field | `enabledForEachIter` | `enabledForFinal` | `requiresTrigger` | `postsThreads` | Score signal |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cursor.enabled=true` | yes | no | no (auto on push) | yes | `Score: N/5` regex |
| `copilot.mode=each-iter` | yes | no | yes (`requested_reviewers` API with `Copilot` — NOT `@copilot` mention which triggers SWE Agent) | yes | "0 unresolved threads" |
| `copilot.mode=final-only` | no | yes | yes (same API, one-shot at end) | yes | "0 unresolved threads" |
| `copilotSwe.mode=each-iter` | yes | no | yes (`gh pr comment "@copilot please review"`) | no — top-level conversational comments | Claude judgment on comment body |
| `copilotSwe.mode=review-score` | yes | no | yes (`@copilot please review` mention, **review-only**) | no — top-level conversational comment | `Readiness: N/5` regex (`scoreRegex`) |
| `copilotSwe.mode=final-only` | no | yes | yes (same mention, one-shot at end) | no | Claude judgment on comment body |
| `codex.mode=each-iter` | yes | no | yes (`codex review --diff`) | no | pass/fail |
| `codex.mode=final-only` | no | yes | yes (one-shot at end) | no | pass/fail |
| `claudeSelf.enabled=true` | no (final-only by design) | yes | no (internal) | no | 1-5 vs rubric |

**⚠ Important: Copilot has TWO products** — `copilot` (Copilot Code Review) and `copilotSwe` (Copilot SWE Agent). They are DIFFERENT:
- **Code Review** posts structured line-level threads. Triggered by adding `Copilot` via the requested-reviewers API (the `@copilot` mention does NOT trigger this). May require specific repo setup (rulesets or manual reviewer add) and a paid Copilot tier with Code Review enabled.
- **SWE Agent** posts conversational top-level comments. Triggered by `@copilot please review` mention. Works out-of-box on most repos with Copilot installed. Applies line-level fixes by pushing commits (verified on exo-vault PR #128 — 7 fixes + a test file). Posts a conversational top-level comment alongside the commits.
Per real-world testing (2026-05-23), SWE Agent fires more reliably on private repos. Code Review may need additional setup most users don't have. Default to `copilotSwe` if Code Review doesn't respond within 10 poll-ticks.

**SWE Agent serves two distinct roles, selected by `copilotSwe.mode`:**
- **`each-iter` — fixer (Mode Y).** The mention asks Copilot to review *and fix*; it pushes commits, Claude reviews them. Copilot drives the change.
- **`review-score` — scoring reviewer (Mode X).** The mention asks Copilot to **review only (no code changes)** and end with `Readiness: X/5`; the loop parses that score with `copilotSwe.scoreRegex` and gates on `== 5`, exactly like `cursor`. **Claude is the fixer.** Use this when you have a Copilot seat but no Cursor Pro and want a Cursor-style 1–5 gate. (`final-only` is a one-shot conversational sanity check, judged by Claude.)

## Mode derivation

`prAutopilot.primaryFixer` (new setting, default `"auto"`):

| `primaryFixer` | Resolved mode | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `"claude"` | X | ABORT if `copilotSwe.mode == "each-iter"` (would conflict — see rule below). Otherwise standard Mode X. |
| `"copilotSwe"` | Y | Force Mode Y; derive_mode returns "Y", pre-flight validates copilotSwe.mode == each-iter (ABORTs there if not). |
| `"auto"` (default) | derived | Inspect reviewer config — see rules below. |

**`primaryFixer="claude"` + `copilotSwe.mode="each-iter"` rule:** ABORT with message — "primaryFixer=claude conflicts with copilotSwe.mode=each-iter. Either set copilotSwe.mode=off (or final-only) or change primaryFixer to copilotSwe or auto." Same reasoning as `auto` case 3 below: silently ignoring a reviewer config wastes user's paid quota.

**`auto` resolution rules** (first match wins):

1. If `copilotSwe.mode == "each-iter"` AND `cursor.enabled == false` AND `copilot.mode != "each-iter"` AND `codex.mode != "each-iter"` → **Mode Y**
2. Else if any of {`cursor.enabled`, `copilot.mode == "each-iter"`, `codex.mode == "each-iter"`, `copilotSwe.mode == "review-score"`} AND `copilotSwe.mode != "each-iter"` → **Mode X** (`review-score` makes SWE Agent a per-iter *reviewer*; Claude fixes)
3. Else if BOTH a per-iter reviewer AND `copilotSwe.mode == "each-iter"` are enabled → **ABORT** with message: "ambiguous fixer config. Set `primaryFixer` to 'claude' or 'copilotSwe' explicitly to resolve."
4. Else (no per-iter anything) → **ABORT** with message: "no per-iter reviewer or fixer enabled; nothing would drive the loop"

```python
function derive_mode(config):
  pf = config.primaryFixer  # default "auto"
  swe_each = config.reviewers.copilotSwe.mode == "each-iter"  # Mode Y fixer ONLY
  any_xreviewer = config.reviewers.cursor.enabled
                  or config.reviewers.copilot.mode == "each-iter"
                  or config.reviewers.codex.mode == "each-iter"
                  or config.reviewers.copilotSwe.mode == "review-score"  # SWE Agent as scoring reviewer (Mode X)

  if pf == "claude":
    if swe_each: return ABORT_CONFIG  # conflict — see message in pre-flight
    return "X"
  if pf == "copilotSwe":
    return "Y"  # pre-flight validates copilotSwe.mode == each-iter
  # pf == "auto"
  if swe_each and not any_xreviewer: return "Y"
  if any_xreviewer and not swe_each: return "X"
  if any_xreviewer and swe_each:     return ABORT_CONFIG  # ambiguous
  return ABORT_NO_DRIVER
```

## Pre-flight: config validation

```python
# Detect mode (see §"Mode derivation" above)
mode = derive_mode(config)

if mode == ABORT_CONFIG:
  # Two ABORT_CONFIG sub-cases — distinguish by primaryFixer setting:
  if config.primaryFixer == "claude":
    # claude + copilotSwe.mode=each-iter conflict
    push_notification(
      "config error",
      "primaryFixer=claude conflicts with copilotSwe.mode=each-iter. Either set copilotSwe.mode=off (or final-only) or change primaryFixer to copilotSwe or auto."
    )
  else:
    # auto with both swe_each and any_xreviewer set — ambiguous
    push_notification(
      "config error",
      "ambiguous fixer config. Set primaryFixer to 'claude' or 'copilotSwe' explicitly to resolve."
    )
  return  # terminate

if mode == ABORT_NO_DRIVER:
  push_notification("config error", "no per-iter reviewer or fixer enabled; nothing would drive the loop")
  return  # terminate

# reachable when primaryFixer=claude is forced with no per-iter reviewer enabled
if mode == "X":
  if not any(getattr(r, "enabledForEachIter", False)
             for r in [config.reviewers.cursor,
                       config.reviewers.copilot,
                       config.reviewers.codex,
                       config.reviewers.copilotSwe]):  # copilotSwe counts only in review-score mode
    push_notification(
      "config error",
      "Mode X requires at least one per-iter reviewer in {cursor, copilot, codex, copilotSwe(review-score)}"
    )
    return  # terminate

if mode == "Y":
  if config.reviewers.copilotSwe.mode != "each-iter":
    push_notification("config error", "Mode Y requires copilotSwe.mode=each-iter")
    return  # terminate
```

## Algorithm: prAutopilotStep(prNumber)

### Pre-flight checks (MUST run first; ABORT cleanly on any failure)

These checks were added after a v0.1.0 dry-run surfaced silent fallthroughs when prerequisites are missing. Each check returns ABORT without `ScheduleWakeup` so the loop terminates instead of retrying a doomed iteration.

```bash
# 0.1 Required CLIs present
for cmd in gh jq git; do
  if ! command -v "$cmd" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    PushNotification("ABORT", "Required CLI not on PATH: $cmd. See reviewers/CURSOR-SETUP.md or README.md for install instructions.")
    return  # terminate (no ScheduleWakeup)
  fi
done

# 0.2 In a git repo
if ! git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  PushNotification("ABORT", "Not in a git repository. cd into the repo containing PR #${prNumber} before invoking /pr-autopilot:step.")
  return  # terminate
fi

# 0.3 `gh` is authenticated
if ! gh auth status >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  PushNotification("ABORT", "gh CLI not authenticated. Run: gh auth login")
  return  # terminate
fi

# 0.4 The PR actually exists in the current repo
if ! gh pr view ${prNumber} --json number >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  PushNotification("ABORT", "PR #${prNumber} not found in $(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner' 2>/dev/null || echo 'this repo'). Verify the PR number and the current working directory.")
  return  # terminate
fi

# 0.4b — graphify code knowledge graph filesystem detection (v0.5.3+)
# Pure filesystem check; NO state interaction yet (state loads in §0.5).
# Also caches GRAPHIFY_OWNER / GRAPHIFY_REPO for reuse in §0.5 STATE_FILE construction
# and §0.6a per-repo notice flag (avoids triple `gh repo view` per tick).
if [ -f "graphify-out/graph.json" ]; then
  _graphifyFsState="present"
elif [ -d "graphify-out" ]; then
  _graphifyFsState="broken"   # folder exists but no graph.json — last `graphify extract` failed
else
  _graphifyFsState="absent"
fi
GRAPHIFY_OWNER=$(gh repo view --json owner --jq '.owner.login')
GRAPHIFY_REPO=$(gh repo view --json name --jq '.name')
GRAPHIFY_NOTICE_FLAG="$HOME/.pr-autopilot/${GRAPHIFY_OWNER}-${GRAPHIFY_REPO}-graphify-notice.flag"
```

### 0.5 Load state

```bash
# Reuse cached GRAPHIFY_OWNER / GRAPHIFY_REPO from §0.4b (DRY — avoids extra `gh repo view` calls)
STATE_FILE="$HOME/.pr-autopilot/${GRAPHIFY_OWNER}-${GRAPHIFY_REPO}-${prNumber}.json"
if [ -f "$STATE_FILE" ]; then state = read $STATE_FILE; else state = createNew(prNumber); fi
```

**Auto-trigger provenance:** When this step was reached because the auto-trigger hook nudged you (the invoking prompt is `/loop /pr-autopilot:step <N>` originating from the hook's `additionalContext`, not a manual user invocation), set on the new state: `"autoTriggered": true, "triggerSource": "posttooluse-hook"`. For manual invocations, set `"autoTriggered": false`. This is informational only (telemetry / debugging) and does not change loop behavior.

**v1→v2 state migration (run immediately after load):** if a loaded state file predates the v2 schema, map the old `pushbackReplies` key onto `threadPushbacks` so Mode X does not lose pushback history. (Mode Y handles v1 state separately — it ABORTs; see Y.0.5.)

```
if state.pushbackReplies AND NOT state.threadPushbacks:
  state.threadPushbacks = state.pushbackReplies   # carry Mode X history forward
# `pushbackReplies` is no longer written; it is dropped entirely in v0.3
```

State schema:

```json
{
  "stateSchemaVersion": 4,
  "prNumber": 0,
  "repo": "<owner>/<name>",
  "headRef": "<branch>",
  "resolvedMode": "X" | "Y",
  "createdAt": "<iso>",
  "updatedAt": "<iso>",

  "fixIterations": 0,
  "pollTicksWithoutReview": 0,
  "pollTicksWithoutActivity": 0,
  "ticksWithoutProgress": 0,

  "autoMergeQueued": false,
  "autoMergeAt": "<iso>",
  "pollTicksWhileQueued": 0,
  "lastHandledHeadOid": "<sha>",
  "lastSeenReviewId": "<gh-review-id>",
  "lastTriggerAt": "<iso>",

  "threadPushbacks": [
    {"threadId": "<id>", "iteration": 0, "reason": "..."}
  ],

  "commitPushbacks": [
    {
      "iteration": 1,
      "atOid": "<sha>",
      "pushbacks": [{"file": "...", "range": "...", "reason": "..."}]
    }
  ],

  "handledOids": ["<sha>", "..."],
  "handledCommentIds": [123456],
  "reviewIteration": 0,

  "graphifyAvailable": false,
  "graphifyBuiltAtCommit": ""
}
```

**Key changes from v0.1 state:**

- `stateSchemaVersion: 3` — bumped from v2 (v0.2) for the v0.4 auto-merge fields. Migration is purely additive: a v2 file loads with `autoMergeQueued: false`, `pollTicksWhileQueued: 0` (defaults); no fresh start needed. The v1 handling below is unchanged.
- `stateSchemaVersion` absent (implicit v1) — treated as v1 (Mode X) and requires a fresh start if the user switches to Mode Y. The `state.stateSchemaVersion is None` Mode-Y ABORT guard (Y.0.5) still keys off "field absent", so the v2→v3 bump does not affect it.
- **Auto-merge fields (v0.4):** `autoMergeQueued` — set true once `gh pr merge` is called; read by **step 0.6** (short-circuit into merge-wait) and **gate 6** (avoid re-queue). `autoMergeAt` — ISO timestamp the merge was queued (telemetry). `pollTicksWhileQueued` — **dedicated** counter incremented ONLY in the step-0.6 merge-wait branch, compared to `pollTickCap` for stuck-queue detection; NOT `pollTicksWithoutReview` / `pollTicksWithoutActivity` (those drive the review lifecycle). State is deleted only when step 0.6 observes `MERGED`/`CLOSED`, never when the merge is merely queued — "queued" ≠ "merged".
- **Graphify awareness fields (v0.5.3, schema v4):** `graphifyAvailable: false`, `graphifyBuiltAtCommit: ""` — set by new §0.6a check (filesystem detection of `graphify-out/graph.json` + jq-typed `built_at_commit` extraction). Migration is purely additive: a v3 state file loads with both defaulted; no fresh start needed. The `state.stateSchemaVersion is None` Mode-Y ABORT guard (Y.0.5) is unaffected — v3→v4 is additive only, the guard fires on field absent, not on field value. `graphifyBuiltAtCommit` is NOT used to gate behavior in v0.5.3 (persisted for v0.5.4 `minimumStaleness` ancestry check).
- `resolvedMode` — persisted on first tick; mode-drift guard (Y.0.5) aborts if config-derived mode differs from stored mode.
- `pushbackReplies` (v0.1) → **split into** `threadPushbacks` (Mode X, was Mode X-only in practice anyway) and `commitPushbacks` (Mode Y new).
- `handledOids`, `handledCommentIds`, `lastTriggerAt`, `pollTicksWithoutActivity`, `reviewIteration` — all Mode Y additions.
- `handledOids` and `handledCommentIds` persist as JSON arrays but are loaded into sets at runtime (see Y.0 set-conversion lines).

**Backwards-compat:** Mode X reads/writes `threadPushbacks` (renamed from `pushbackReplies`). When a v1 state file is loaded, the migration step in `### 0.5 Load state` maps `pushbackReplies` onto `threadPushbacks` so no history is lost; `pushbackReplies` is no longer written and is dropped entirely in v0.3.

**Migration decision:** v1 state files (no `stateSchemaVersion` field) are treated as Mode X; if the current derived mode is Y, ABORT with a message telling the user to delete the stale state file to start fresh in Mode Y.

### 0.6 Merge-wait short-circuit (v0.4 — runs BEFORE Mode dispatch)

If a previous tick queued an auto-merge (`state.autoMergeQueued == true`), this tick is waiting for GitHub to **complete** the queued merge — not for reviewers. Short-circuit here, *before* the Mode dispatch, so neither Mode X (step 9a final-pass) nor Mode Y (Y.5 `@copilot` re-trigger, Y.6 idle-counting) re-runs review logic on a PR that is merely waiting to merge. Placement is load-bearing: `safeAutoMerge` is called from BOTH modes, so a queued **Mode Y** loop must be caught here too — and running before Mode dispatch also pre-empts the generic Y.2 `MERGED` cleanup so the tailored "merged → run /land-and-deploy" message wins.

```
if state.autoMergeQueued == true:
  pr = gh pr view ${prNumber} --json state,isDraft,mergeStateStatus,baseRefName
  if pr.state == "MERGED":
    delete $STATE_FILE
    PushNotification("PR #${prNumber} merged → ${pr.baseRefName}", "Run /land-and-deploy for ${pr.baseRefName}→master + deploy.")
    return  # SUCCESS, terminate
  if pr.state == "CLOSED":
    delete $STATE_FILE
    PushNotification("PR #${prNumber} closed without merge", "auto-merge abandoned")
    return  # terminate
  if pr.mergeStateStatus == "DIRTY":                                   # DIRTY = GitHub's merge-conflict state. There is NO "CONFLICTING" enum value. BLOCKED (branch protection) falls through to the stuck-cap below.
    PushNotification("PR #${prNumber} auto-merge blocked (conflicts)", "resolve, then re-run /pr-autopilot:step ${prNumber}")
    return  # STOP, KEEP state (see "Recovery" in §Error handling)
  state.pollTicksWhileQueued += 1
  if state.pollTicksWhileQueued >= config.pollTickCap:                 # stuck (e.g. branch protection needs human review)
    PushNotification("PR #${prNumber} auto-merge still pending", "after ${config.pollTickCap} ticks — check PR / branch protection")
    saveState($STATE_FILE)
    return  # STOP, KEEP state
  saveState($STATE_FILE)
  ScheduleWakeup(config.pollIntervalSeconds, "/loop /pr-autopilot:step ${prNumber}", "waiting for queued auto-merge to complete")
  return  # still queued — wait; skip steps 1-11 AND Mode dispatch
```

### 0.6a graphify advisory dispatch (v0.5.3+)

Placed AFTER §0.6 merge-wait short-circuit so queued-merge ticks are NEVER disturbed by graphify notifications. Reads `_graphifyFsState` cached in §0.4b. Runs BEFORE Mode dispatch so both Mode X and Mode Y get a consistent `state.graphifyAvailable`.

```python
# 0.6a — graphify state + advisory (runs AFTER §0.6, BEFORE Mode dispatch)

cfg_advisory = config.graphify.advisory  # "auto" (default) | "always" | "off"

# advisory=off short-circuits at TOP — skips ALL filesystem dispatches.
# Defends advisory=off + broken folder from firing PAUSE.
if cfg_advisory == "off":
  state.graphifyAvailable = false
  goto __graphify_advisory_done__   # fall through to Mode dispatch

# advisory in {"auto", "always"} — apply filesystem state from §0.4b
case _graphifyFsState of:

  "present":
    state.graphifyAvailable = true
    # Hardened jq with type check — defends against future graphify versions emitting
    # an object {} or null for .built_at_commit (current Asistel-verified value: real SHA).
    BUILT_AT=$(jq -r 'if (.built_at_commit | type) == "string" then .built_at_commit else "" end' graphify-out/graph.json 2>/dev/null || echo "")
    state.graphifyBuiltAtCommit = "$BUILT_AT"
    # NOT used to gate behavior in v0.5.3 — persisted for v0.5.4 minimumStaleness ancestry check.

  "broken":
    # Rationale: broken folder indicates a failed prior build — the graph state is
    # indeterminate. `advisory=auto` still PAUSEs here (asymmetric vs the absent case
    # which only INFOs) because continuing the loop with unknown graph state is less
    # safe than blocking once with an actionable rebuild message. `advisory=off`
    # short-circuited above and never reaches this branch.
    state.graphifyAvailable = false
    PushNotification("PR #${prNumber} PAUSED — graphify build incomplete", "graphify-out/ exists but graph.json is missing (last `graphify extract` may have failed). Run `graphify extract . --backend deepseek` to rebuild, then re-run /pr-autopilot:step ${prNumber}.")
    saveState($STATE_FILE)
    return  # PAUSE; KEEP state

  "absent":
    state.graphifyAvailable = false
    if cfg_advisory == "always":
      PushNotification("PR #${prNumber} PAUSED — graphify required but missing", "graphify.advisory=always but no graphify-out/graph.json found. Run `/graphify .` first, then re-run /pr-autopilot:step ${prNumber}. To disable strict mode set graphify.advisory=auto in ~/.claude/settings.json.")
      saveState($STATE_FILE)
      return  # PAUSE; KEEP state
    else:  # cfg_advisory == "auto"
      # Per-repo notice flag (NOT per-PR) — uses $GRAPHIFY_NOTICE_FLAG cached in §0.4b
      if [ ! -f "$GRAPHIFY_NOTICE_FLAG" ]; then
        PushNotification("INFO: graphify recommendation", "This repo has no graphify code knowledge graph. Run `/graphify .` once for token-reduction during PR review loops. (See README §'Code knowledge graph awareness'.)")
        touch "$GRAPHIFY_NOTICE_FLAG"
      fi
      # fall through normally — loop continues

__graphify_advisory_done__:
```

**Mode dispatch** — after pre-flight resolves `mode` and loads state, route to the Mode Y algorithm or fall through to Mode X:

```python
# After pre-flight resolves `mode`, the mode-drift guard, AND step 0.6:
if mode == "Y":
  return prAutopilotStepModeY(prNumber)   # see "Algorithm: Mode Y" below
# else fall through to Mode X (steps 1-11.5 unchanged)
```

### 1. Fetch PR state

```
pr = gh pr view ${prNumber} --json headRefName,baseRefName,headRefOid,number,state,reviews,statusCheckRollup
```

### 2. PR lifecycle guard

```
if pr.state in {CLOSED, MERGED}:
  delete $STATE_FILE
  PushNotification("PR ${prNumber} ${pr.state}", "loop done; state cleaned up")
  return  # terminate
```

### 3. Branch protection guard

```
if pr.headRefName in {dev, master, main}:
  PushNotification("ABORT", "refusing to operate on direct dev/master/main PR")
  return  # terminate
```

### 4. Fix-iteration cap

```
if state.fixIterations >= config.fixIterationCap:
  PushNotification("ABORT", "${config.fixIterationCap} fix-iteration cap reached; manual review required")
  return  # terminate
```

### 5. CI health check

`lastHandledHeadOid` was set in step 11 of the PREVIOUS iteration right after we pushed. If current `headRefOid` still matches, no other actor pushed in between — the failed CI is from OUR push.

```
required_checks = pr.statusCheckRollup | filter where isRequired
any_failed = required_checks | any where conclusion == "FAILURE"
any_pending = required_checks | any where state in {QUEUED, IN_PROGRESS, PENDING}

if any_failed AND pr.headRefOid == state.lastHandledHeadOid:
  PushNotification("ABORT", "CI failed on our last push; investigate before continuing")
  return  # terminate

if any_pending:
  # CONTINUE — wait for CI to settle
  saveState($STATE_FILE)
  ScheduleWakeup(90s, ...)
  return  # waiting
```

### 5.5 Trigger non-auto reviewers

```
per_iter_reviewers = config.reviewers | filter where derivation.enabledForEachIter == true
for r in per_iter_reviewers:
  if r.derivation.requiresTrigger:
    case r.name:
      "copilot":
        # Copilot CODE REVIEW (line-level threaded)
        # Use the requested_reviewers API, NOT @copilot mention (mention triggers SWE Agent)
        gh api repos/${owner}/${repo}/pulls/${prNumber}/requested_reviewers \
          --method POST -f 'reviewers[]=Copilot' >/dev/null 2>&1 || true

```

# Per-reviewer isSuccess (defined per-adapter):
# - cursor:     outcomes.cursor.score == "5"

#                If score < 5 (or score missing — re-trigger next tick), treat the issues listed
#                in the comment body as pseudo-threads for triage in step 10, same as below.

```

### 10. Triage (multi-login dispatch)

**Graphify preamble (v0.5.3+):** If `state.graphifyAvailable == true` AND `config.graphify.promptHint == true` (default), apply this reasoning rule BEFORE invoking review triage:

> Before judging reviewer comments about symbol X, query `graphify explain "X"` to see X's connections/community. Use `graphify path "X" "Y"` for dependency-validity questions. Only `Read` source files when graphify returns insufficient context.

Invoke the routine in `REVIEW-TRIAGE-COPY.md` with:

- `threads = unresolved_not_ours`
- `reviewerLogins = github_reviewer_logins`
- `pushbackRubric = read PUSHBACK.md`
- `mode = "unattended"`

```
triage_result = invokeReviewTriage(threads, reviewerLogins, pushbackRubric, mode="unattended")

if triage_result.askUser.length > 0:
  PushNotification("PAUSE", "ambiguous review thread; user input needed: ${triage_result.askUser[0].body[:120]}")
  return  # PAUSE
```

### 11. Pre-commit verification + push

```
if triage_result.editsApplied > 0:
  # Pick the profile
  repo_basename = gh repo view --json name --jq '.name'
  profile = config.preCommitProfiles[repo_basename]
       OR config.preCommitProfiles["default-${detect_pm_from_lockfile()}"]
       OR null  # no profile → skip with warning

      if exit != 0:

        return  # ABORT

  git add -A
  git commit -m "chore(pr-autopilot): iteration ${state.fixIterations + 1} (${triage_result.editsApplied} fixes, ${triage_result.pushbacks} pushbacks)"

    for t in triage_result.pushedBackThreads
  ])
  # lastSeenReviewId updated below in 11.5
```

### 11.5 Stall guard

```
current_review_id = pr.reviews | jq 'last.id // null'
did_anything = (triage_result.editsApplied > 0) OR (triage_result.pushbacks > 0)

# Compute review_unchanged BEFORE updating lastSeenReviewId — first-tick-after-review edge case

    return  # PAUSE
else:
  state.ticksWithoutProgress = 0

if current_review_id != null:
  state.lastSeenReviewId = current_review_id

saveState($STATE_FILE)
```

### 12. Continue: schedule next tick

```
ScheduleWakeup(delaySeconds=config.pollIntervalSeconds,
                prompt="/loop /pr-autopilot:step ${prNumber}",
                reason="polling for reviewer re-review")

### Mode Y design notes

**Why no final-pass in Mode Y v0.2** (resolves Blocker 5): Mode X step 9a runs final-pass reviewers (claudeSelf, Codex, Copilot Code Review) after primary success. Adding final-pass to Mode Y SUCCESS_STOP creates a multi-reviewer orchestration problem (PUSHBACK rubric applied to commits vs threads, different success signals to aggregate). Defer to v0.3 alongside the auto-trigger work — v0.3 owns reviewer-orchestration improvements.

**Why pushback counter, not commit counter:** SWE Agent's pushes count against ITS own iteration cap (managed by GitHub/Copilot tier limits), not Claude's. Claude's bounded resource in Mode Y is "how many times have I posted pushback comments" — that's what `fixIterationCap` protects against (a ping-pong loop where SWE Agent keeps pushing changes that don't address Claude's concerns). `reviewIteration` and `len(commitPushbacks)` differ by one only when the most recent review was all-APPROVE — they otherwise increment together.

**The "approval prose without commits → PAUSE-by-default" branch** (resolves Medium #8) handles the case where SWE Agent posts "LGTM" without pushing anything. PR #127 worked because the body said "deliberate smells" — without that signal, "LGTM with no changes" is too weak a signal to auto-succeed on. Default to PAUSE; user confirms manually.

**The `is_refusal` and `is_approval_prose` heuristics** are simple regex over comment body, defined in the Helper functions (Mode Y) subsection above; simple regex over the comment body.

## Auto-merge: `safeAutoMerge(prNumber, baseRef, readySummary)` (v0.4)

Shared SUCCESS_STOP handler called from **both** terminal sites — Mode X step 9c and Mode Y Y.10 — with the **same gates**. It applies the auto-merge gates; if all pass it queues the merge and lets **step 0.6** finish the job on a later tick. If any gate fails it falls back to the existing notify-and-stop (the v0.3 default — unchanged when no repo is opted in).

`readySummary` is the caller's mode-specific success summary, used only in the Gate-1 default notification so each mode keeps its existing "ready" message.

**Config:** read `prAutopilot.autoMerge` from `~/.claude/settings.json` (defaults: `allowedTargetBranches=["dev"]`, `neverMergeToBranches=["master","main","production"]`, `mergeMethod="squash"`).

**Notification discipline:** exactly ONE notification per terminal outcome. A gate failure fires its single "ready / not-merged" message and deletes state (loop done, manual merge). The queue path fires only the "auto-merge queued" message and KEEPS state. No double-notifying.

    else:

      PushNotification("PR #${prNumber} auto-merge blocked", "direct merge refused (branch protection?) — merge manually or run /land-and-deploy")

  state.autoMergeAt = now()

```

**Gate semantics (precise):**

| Gate | Check | On fail |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — opt-in | `canon` ∈ `~/.pr-autopilot/automerge-repos`, case-insensitive | notify "ready; merge manually or run /land-and-deploy"; delete state; STOP (**DEFAULT** — same notify-and-stop control flow as v0.3) |
| 2 — not paused | `~/.pr-autopilot/paused` absent | notify + STOP |
| 3 — base safe | `baseRef` ∈ `allowedTargetBranches` AND ∉ `neverMergeToBranches` | notify "run /land-and-deploy"; STOP |
| 4 — PR ready | `state == OPEN` AND `isDraft == false` | notify + STOP |
| 5 — CI green | all required checks green on `headRefOid` | notify "CI not green — not auto-merging"; STOP |
| 6 — idempotent | `state.autoMergeQueued != true` | skip re-queue; go to wait |

Gates 1 (default-off) + 3 (production guard) are the safety floor. `lineMatchCaseInsensitive` reuses the v0.3 auto-trigger gate-script matching helper verbatim.

| `fixIterationCap` fix cap | 4 | ABORT |
| CI failed on our last push | 5 | ABORT |
| `pollTickCap` ticks without any per-iter reviewer reviewing | 8 | ABORT |
| All per-iter reviewers report success AND all final-pass reviewers agree | 9b | SUCCESS_STOP |
| ≥50 review threads (likely truncation) | 6 | PAUSE |
| Triage flagged ASK_USER | 10 | PAUSE |
| Local pre-commit suite failed | 11 | ABORT |
| `stallTickCap` ticks with same review and zero actions (stall) | 11.5 | PAUSE |
| Final-pass reviewer disagrees | 9a | PAUSE |
| Reviewers green, auto-merge gate fails (not opted-in / paused / base unsafe / not-ready / CI not green) | 9c / Y.10 (`safeAutoMerge` gates 1–5) | SUCCESS_STOP (notify "ready", manual merge) |
| Reviewers green, all auto-merge gates pass → merge queued, waiting for GitHub | 9c / Y.10 → 0.6 | CONTINUE (wait) |
| Auto-merge blocked (conflicts / `mergeStateStatus` DIRTY) | 0.6 | STOP (KEEP state) |
| Auto-merge stuck (`pollTickCap` ticks while queued) | 0.6 | STOP (KEEP state) |
| PR merged after queue | 0.6 | SUCCESS_STOP (state deleted) |
| **Graphify (v0.5.3+):** `advisory=off` AND any filesystem state | 0.6a | PASS (no notification, `state.graphifyAvailable=false`) |
| **Graphify:** `state.autoMergeQueued=true` (queued-merge wait) | 0.6 short-circuits BEFORE 0.6a | §0.6a never runs; merge wait proceeds normally |
| **Graphify:** `advisory=auto` AND `graph.json` present | 0.6a | PASS (silent, `state.graphifyAvailable=true`) |
| **Graphify:** `advisory=auto` AND `graph.json` absent (no folder) | 0.6a | INFO once per repo (notice flag), continue |
| **Graphify:** `advisory=auto` AND broken folder (cache without graph.json) | 0.6a | PAUSE (KEEP state, rebuild message) |
| **Graphify:** `advisory=always` AND `graph.json` absent | 0.6a | PAUSE (KEEP state, strict-mode message) |
| **Graphify:** `advisory=always` AND broken folder | 0.6a | PAUSE (KEEP state, rebuild message) |

## Error handling (auto-merge, v0.4)

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `--auto` not enabled on repo | fall back to direct `gh pr merge --${mergeMethod} --delete-branch` (synchronous; CI + reviews already green). On success → delete state + notify "merged" (do NOT set `autoMergeQueued`/wait); if refused (e.g. branch protection) → notify "blocked" + STOP |
| Merge blocked (branch protection needs human approval, conflicts, no permission) | step 0.6 notifies; **keeps** state; STOP (no infinite loop) |
| Queue stuck (open + queued beyond `pollTickCap` ticks) | step 0.6 notifies; STOP; keeps state |
| PR merged/closed externally while queued | step 0.6 sees `MERGED`/`CLOSED` → cleanup + terminate |

**Recovery from a kept-state STOP (blocked/stuck):** state is retained so nothing is lost. Either (a) resolve the PR (fix conflicts / obtain the required human approval) and re-run `/pr-autopilot:step <PR#>` — step 0.6 picks up the queued merge and finishes — or (b) delete `~/.pr-autopilot/<owner>-<repo>-<N>.json` to abandon. A dedicated `/pr-autopilot:clear` is out of scope for v0.4.
