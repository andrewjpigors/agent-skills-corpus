# Create Article Skill

Create publication-ready long-form articles by synthesizing insights from the user's knowledge base, following established tone of voice and structural patterns.

## Quick Start

1. **Search knowledge base** for relevant permanent notes on the topic
2. **Check Article Index** to avoid duplicates and see related work
3. **Create article folder** with proper structure
4. **Write article** following tone of voice guidelines
5. **Update Article Index** with new entry
6. **Upload to Google Drive** `Articles/cornelius_drafts` for review

## State Dependencies

| Source | Location | Read | Write | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------|-------------|
| Permanent Notes | `Brain/02-Permanent/` | ✓ | | Core insights for synthesis |
| AI Extracted Notes | `Brain/AI Extracted Notes/` | ✓ | | AI-extracted insights |
| Document Insights | `Brain/Document Insights/` | ✓ | | Research extracts |
| MOCs | `Brain/03-MOCs/` | ✓ | | Topic overviews |
| Article Index | `Brain/04-Output/Articles/ARTICLE-INDEX.md` | ✓ | ✓ | Registry of all articles |
| Tone of Voice | `.claude/skills/create-article/tone-of-voice.md` | ✓ | | Voice DNA and writing style |
| Article Structure | `.claude/skills/create-article/article-structure.md` | ✓ | | Templates and patterns |
| Metadata Template | `.claude/skills/create-article/metadata-template.md` | ✓ | | Template for _metadata.md |
| Article Folder | `Brain/04-Output/Articles/[article-name]/` | | ✓ | Output folder for article |
| Main Article | `Brain/04-Output/Articles/[article-name]/[article-name].md` | | ✓ | The article itself |
| Metadata File | `Brain/04-Output/Articles/[article-name]/_metadata.md` | | ✓ | Creation record |
| Google Drive | `Articles/cornelius_drafts` (shared drive) | | ✓ | Upload article folder for review |
| Drive Folder Map | `.claude/resources/google_drive_folders.md` | ✓ | | Google Drive folder IDs |

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Research Phase

Search the knowledge base for relevant insights:

```bash
# Semantic search for topic
resources/local-brain-search/run_search.sh "your topic" --limit 15 --json

# Find connections to existing notes
resources/local-brain-search/run_connections.sh "Related Note Name" --json
```

**Key locations to search:**
- `Brain/02-Permanent/` - Core insights and permanent notes
- `Brain/AI Extracted Notes/` - AI-extracted insights
- `Brain/Document Insights/` - Research extracts
- `Brain/03-MOCs/` - Maps of Content for topic overviews

**Enrich with BDG context** (optional - reveals which notes are generative frameworks vs reflective):
```bash
resources/brain-graph/run_brain_graph.sh inspect "Key Source Note" --json
```

### Step 2: Check Article Index

**MANDATORY**: Read the Article Index before creating any article:

```
Brain/04-Output/Articles/ARTICLE-INDEX.md
```

- Check for existing articles on similar topics
- Identify gaps in topic coverage
- Note related articles for cross-referencing

### Step 3: Create Article Structure

Create folder and files:

```
Brain/04-Output/Articles/[article-name]/
├── [article-name].md          # Main article
├── _metadata.md               # Creation record
└── [images if needed]
```

**Naming:** Use kebab-case (e.g., `cognitive-aware-ai-systems`)

### Step 4: Write Article

Follow the tone of voice and structure guidelines in:
- [tone-of-voice.md](tone-of-voice.md) - Voice DNA and writing style
- [article-structure.md](article-structure.md) - Templates and patterns

### Step 5: Update Article Index

Add entry to `ARTICLE-INDEX.md`:
- Article name and link
- Created date
- Topic category
- Status (Draft)
- Notes

### Step 6: Upload to Google Drive

Upload the article folder to `Articles/cornelius_drafts` on the shared Google Drive:

```bash
# Upload the entire article folder (with images, metadata, etc.)
python3 .claude/scripts/google/google_drive.py upload-folder "Brain/04-Output/Articles/[article-name]" 1fxxbEwS86gguYXA1hJsFesr13ruXx80S --recursive
```

**Google Drive folder IDs**: See `.claude/resources/google_drive_folders.md`

- `Articles/cornelius_drafts` folder ID: `1fxxbEwS86gguYXA1hJsFesr13ruXx80S`
- This puts the article where the user and a content agent can access it for review and publishing
- The folder preserves the same structure as the local article folder

## File References

For detailed guidance, see:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [tone-of-voice.md](tone-of-voice.md) | Complete voice DNA, do's/don'ts, vocabulary |
| [article-structure.md](article-structure.md) | Templates for different article types |
| [metadata-template.md](metadata-template.md) | Template for _metadata.md files |

## Key Principles

### Voice Summary

the user's long-form voice transforms complex research into actionable business insights through methodical, evidence-based teaching. He challenges assumptions with data while maintaining accessibility, creating structured learning experiences that bridge academic rigor with practical application.

### Essential Do's

- Open with clear learning objectives or discoveries
- Cite specific research, studies, and data points
- Use numbered lists and bullet points for complex info
- Include TL;DR or summary sections
- Define technical terms immediately after introducing them
- Build arguments systematically from evidence to conclusion
- Provide actionable frameworks readers can apply

### Essential Don'ts

- Never make claims without supporting evidence
- Avoid emotional appeals without data backing
- Don't use jargon without clear explanations
- Never hedge with "maybe" or passive voice
- Avoid corporate buzzwords ("synergy", "leverage", "utilize")

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

Adjust content based on target platform:

| Platform | Word Count | Depth | Structure |
|----------|------------|-------|-----------|
| **Substack** | 1,500-3,000 | Deep dive, full research | Long-form template with TL;DR |
| **Medium** | 1,500-2,500 | Comprehensive but focused | Clear sections, strong hook |
| **LinkedIn** | 800-1,200 | Punchy, business-focused | Shorter paragraphs, bold insights |
| **Blog** | 1,200-2,500 | Flexible | Depends on audience |

### Platform Adjustments

**Substack/Newsletter:**
- More personal voice allowed
- Can use "I've found..." openings
- Encourage replies/engagement at end
- Include "Further reading" section

**Medium:**
- Strong SEO-friendly title
- Compelling subtitle
- Use images/diagrams
- End with clear takeaway

**LinkedIn:**
- Shorter paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
- More white space
- Lead with insight, not setup
- Business application focus
- End with question to drive engagement

## Content-Agent Integration

This skill can be called headlessly by content agent for content production:

```bash
cd $PROJECT_ROOT
claude -p "/create-article <topic> for <platform>" --output-format json
```

**Response format for a content agent:**
```json
{
  "result": "[Full article text with [[note citations]]]",
  "metadata": {
    "word_count": 1847,
    "platform": "substack",
    "cited_notes": ["Note 1", "Note 2", "Note 3"]
  }
}
```

When called by a content agent:
- Return article text directly (don't save to file)
- Include cited notes list
- Focus on the user's unique/contrarian perspectives

---

## Output Location

All articles go to: `Brain/04-Output/Articles/[article-name]/`

After creation, open the folder:
```bash
open "Brain/04-Output/Articles/[article-name]/"
```
