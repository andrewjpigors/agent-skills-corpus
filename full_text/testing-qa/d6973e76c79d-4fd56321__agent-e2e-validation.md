# Agent E2E Validation: Full-Stack Behavioral Testing

## Purpose

Simulate real user and operator behavior against every deployed agent service to validate that the full agentic retail platform works end-to-end. This is **not** automated unit/integration testing — it is a structured manual exploration where each agent is treated as an independent solution, exercised through its public HTTP endpoints, asynchronous Event Hub triggers, and MCP tool surface.

## When To Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- Validate all 26 agents are reachable and responding correctly after deployment.
- Run behavioral prompts of varying complexity against each agent domain.
- Verify Event Hub async processing chains are firing and completing.
- Test MCP tool calls between agents through APIM routing.
- Perform pre-demo or post-deployment confidence checks on the full platform.
- Diagnose issues across the distributed agent mesh.

**Trigger phrases**: "run e2e validation", "test all agents", "validate deployment", "agent smoke test", "behavioral test suite", "validate agent endpoints".

## MANDATORY: Pre-Flight Infrastructure Recovery

> **ALWAYS start here. Do not skip this section. Every validation session begins with infrastructure recovery.**

The dev environment is subject to MCAPSGov nightly automation that stops PostgreSQL, disables Entra AD auth, and shuts down the AKS cluster. The CRUD service (and by extension every agent that depends on it) will be completely down until recovery completes.

### Step 0: Run the Start-Dev-Environment Script

```powershell
./scripts/start-dev-environment.ps1
```

**What it does (in order)**:
1. Starts PostgreSQL Flexible Server (AKS pods depend on it being ready first)
2. Polls until PostgreSQL reports `Ready` state (up to 30 attempts, 10s each)
3. Re-enables Entra AD authentication if MCAPSGov disabled it
4. Re-registers the CRUD service managed identity as PostgreSQL Entra admin if dropped
5. Starts the AKS cluster if stopped
6. Detects unready CRUD pods and forces a rollout restart to acquire fresh Entra tokens

**Verify script completed successfully** — look for `Dev environment ready.` at the end.

### Step 0.1: Verify Core Connectivity

After the script completes, verify these endpoints respond before proceeding:

| Check | Command | Expected |
|-------|---------|----------|
| CRUD health | `curl -s $APIM_BASE/api/health` | `{"status": "ok"}` |
| CRUD readiness | `curl -s $APIM_BASE/api/ready` | `{"status": "ready", ...}` (DB + Redis + Event Hub) |
| Product listing | `curl -s "$APIM_BASE/api/products?limit=1"` | JSON array with at least 1 product |
| Agent health (any) | `curl -s $APIM_BASE/agents/ecommerce-catalog-search/health` | `{"status": "ok"}` |

Where `$APIM_BASE` is resolved from:
1. `azd env get-values` → `APIM_GATEWAY_URL` (preferred)
2. Computed: `https://<projectName>-<environment>-apim.azure-api.net`
3. **Fallback**: Use the SWA proxy at `https://blue-meadow-00fcb8810.4.azurestaticapps.net/api` (routes through Next.js API proxy → APIM)

### Step 0.2: Deep Investigation Protocol

If **any** pre-flight check fails, do NOT proceed to agent testing. Instead:

1. **Check AKS pod status**: `kubectl get pods -n holiday-peak-crud --no-headers` and `kubectl get pods -n holiday-peak-agents --no-headers`
2. **Check pod logs**: `kubectl logs -n holiday-peak-crud deployment/crud-service-crud-service --tail=50`
3. **Check Event Hub connectivity**: `kubectl logs -n holiday-peak-agents deployment/<agent-name> --tail=30 | grep -i "event.*hub\|consumer\|partition"`
4. **Check Redis**: `kubectl exec -n holiday-peak-crud deployment/crud-service-crud-service -- python -c "import redis; r=redis.from_url('$REDIS_URL'); print(r.ping())"`
5. **Check Cosmos DB**: verify `COSMOS_ACCOUNT_URI` is reachable via `curl -s "$COSMOS_ACCOUNT_URI" -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"`
6. **Check APIM proxy**: `curl -sv $APIM_BASE/api/health 2>&1 | grep "< HTTP"`
7. **Re-run the recovery script** if infrastructure was partially recovered
8. **Document every failure** with timestamp, endpoint, HTTP status, and response body before retrying

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Sync Agents (11 — real-time, user-facing)

Agents: ecommerce-catalog-search, ecommerce-cart-intelligence, ecommerce-checkout-support, ecommerce-order-status, ecommerce-product-detail-enrichment, crm-profile-aggregation, crm-support-assistance, inventory-reservation-validation, logistics-eta-computation, logistics-carrier-selection, logistics-returns-support.

| Requirement | Target | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| Agent health response | < 2 seconds | `GET /agents/{service}/health` |
| Invoke response P95 | < 8 seconds (5s pipeline + 3s HTTP overhead) | `POST /agents/{service}/invoke` |
| Streaming response (SSE) | First token < 3 seconds | `POST /agents/{service}/invoke/stream` |
| MCP tool call | < 5 seconds round-trip | `POST /agents/{service}/mcp/{tool}` |
| CRUD REST operations | < 500ms for reads, < 1s for writes | Standard REST calls |

### Async Agents (15 — background, event-driven)

Agents: crm-campaign-intelligence, crm-segmentation-personalization, inventory-alerts-triggers, inventory-health-check, inventory-jit-replenishment, logistics-route-issue-detection, product-management-acp-transformation, product-management-assortment-optimization, product-management-consistency-validation, product-management-normalization-classification, search-enrichment-agent, truth-ingestion, truth-enrichment, truth-hitl, truth-export.

| Requirement | Target | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| Agent health response | < 2 seconds | `GET /agents/{service}/health` |
| Event Hub processing | Event consumed within 30 seconds | Check agent logs after CRUD event publish |
| Consumer lag | < 10 minutes behind head | Event Hubs consumer group lag metric |
| Throughput (batch window) | Process ≥ 95% of events per 15-min window | Log Analytics query on processed vs received |
| MCP tool call | < 5 seconds round-trip | `POST /agents/{service}/mcp/{tool}` |

> **Note:** Async agents do NOT have an invoke latency SLA. Their `/invoke` endpoint (if present) is used for manual testing only and is not subject to the 8-second target.

## Endpoint Reference

### Standard Agent Endpoints (all 26 agents)

Every agent built with `create_standard_app()` exposes:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/health` | GET | Liveness check |
| `/ready` | GET | Readiness (memory tiers, Foundry bindings) |
| `/invoke` | POST | Synchronous agent invocation |
| `/invoke/stream` | POST | SSE streaming invocation |
| `/integrations` | GET | List connected integrations |
| `/self-healing/status` | GET | Self-healing kernel status |
| `/agent/traces` | GET | Recent trace data |
| `/agent/metrics` | GET | Agent performance metrics |
| `/mcp/{tool_name}` | POST | MCP tool call (agent-to-agent) |

### APIM Routing Convention

```
APIM Gateway
├── /api/*                              → CRUD Service (REST)
├── /agents/{service-name}/invoke       → Agent POST /invoke
├── /agents/{service-name}/health       → Agent GET /health
├── /agents/{service-name}/mcp/{tool}   → Agent POST /mcp/{tool}
└── /agents/{service-name}/invoke/stream → Agent POST /invoke/stream
```

### Public Endpoint Resolution

Use this priority order to determine the base URL:

1. **`APIM_GATEWAY_URL`** from `azd env get-values` (production-grade, direct to APIM)
2. **Computed APIM URL**: `https://{projectName}-{env}-apim.azure-api.net`
3. **SWA proxy** (fallback): `https://blue-meadow-00fcb8810.4.azurestaticapps.net/api` — routes through Next.js `[...path]/route.ts` → APIM

| 1 | **Low** | Single-intent query, deterministic response expected |
| 2 | **Medium** | Multi-attribute query, requires context aggregation |
| 3 | **High** | Multi-step reasoning, cross-domain, ambiguous intent |

### Call Type Legend

| Type | Symbol | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| HTTP Sync | `[HTTP]` | `POST /agents/{svc}/invoke` with JSON payload |
| HTTP Stream | `[SSE]` | `POST /agents/{svc}/invoke/stream` with SSE response |
| Event Hub Async | `[EH]` | Trigger via CRUD action that publishes to Event Hub; verify agent consumed event |
| MCP Tool | `[MCP]` | `POST /agents/{svc}/mcp/{tool}` structured data call |

## Cross-Domain Integration Tests

After individual agent validation, run these cross-domain scenarios that exercise the full choreography:

| # | Scenario | Agents Involved | Trigger | Verification |
|---|----------|----------------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | **Customer Order Flow** | cart-intelligence → checkout-support → CRUD orders → order-status → carrier-selection → eta-computation | `POST /api/cart/items` → `POST /api/checkout/sessions` → `POST /api/orders` | Order created, carrier assigned, ETA computed |
| 2 | **Product Enrichment Pipeline** | truth-ingestion → truth-enrichment → truth-hitl → truth-export → search-enrichment → catalog-search | CSV upload to truth-ingestion | Product searchable via intelligent search |
| 3 | **Inventory Alert Chain** | CRUD inventory update → alerts-triggers → jit-replenishment → health-check | `PATCH /api/inventory/{sku}` (set stock to 1) | Alert generated, replenishment calculated, health updated |
| 4 | **Return Processing Flow** | CRUD returns → support-assistance → returns-support → inventory update | `POST /api/returns` | Return processed, logistics arranged, stock updated |
| 5 | **Campaign Attribution Loop** | CRUD order → campaign-intelligence → profile-aggregation → segmentation-personalization | `POST /api/orders` | Campaign attribution updated, profile refreshed, segment recalculated |

## Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Infrastructure (mandatory, 5-10 min)

```powershell
# Step 1: Recover infrastructure
./scripts/start-dev-environment.ps1

# Step 2: Resolve APIM base URL
$azdVars = azd env get-values | ConvertFrom-StringData
$APIM_BASE = if ($azdVars.APIM_GATEWAY_URL) { $azdVars.APIM_GATEWAY_URL.TrimEnd('/') } else { "https://holidaypeakhub405-dev-apim.azure-api.net" }

# Step 3: Verify core connectivity
curl -s "$APIM_BASE/api/health"
curl -s "$APIM_BASE/api/ready"
curl -s "$APIM_BASE/api/products?limit=1"
```

### Phase 2: Agent Health Sweep (2-3 min)

Run health checks on all 26 agents:

```powershell
$agents = @(
  "ecommerce-cart-intelligence", "ecommerce-catalog-search", "ecommerce-checkout-support",
  "ecommerce-order-status", "ecommerce-product-detail-enrichment",
  "crm-campaign-intelligence", "crm-profile-aggregation",
  "crm-segmentation-personalization", "crm-support-assistance",
  "inventory-alerts-triggers", "inventory-health-check",
  "inventory-jit-replenishment", "inventory-reservation-validation",
  "logistics-carrier-selection", "logistics-eta-computation",
  "logistics-returns-support", "logistics-route-issue-detection",
  "product-management-acp-transformation", "product-management-assortment-optimization",
  "product-management-consistency-validation", "product-management-normalization-classification",
  "search-enrichment-agent",
  "truth-ingestion", "truth-enrichment", "truth-hitl", "truth-export"
)

foreach ($agent in $agents) {
    $url = "$APIM_BASE/agents/$agent/health"
    try {
        $resp = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -TimeoutSec 5
        Write-Host "[OK] $agent" -ForegroundColor Green
    } catch {
        Write-Host "[FAIL] $agent - $($_.Exception.Message)" -ForegroundColor Red
    }
}
```

### Phase 3: Domain-by-Domain Testing (30-60 min)

Execute the testing plan tables above, domain by domain:
1. eCommerce (5 agents × 10 prompts = 50 tests)
2. CRM (4 agents × 10 prompts = 40 tests)
3. Inventory (4 agents × 10 prompts = 40 tests)
4. Logistics (4 agents × 10 prompts = 40 tests)
5. Product Management (4 agents × 10 prompts = 40 tests)
6. Truth Layer + Search (5 agents × 10 prompts = 50 tests)

**Total: 260 individual test cases**

### Phase 4: Cross-Domain Integration (15-20 min)

Execute the 5 cross-domain integration scenarios listed above.

### Phase 5: Results Summary

For each agent, record:

| Agent | Health | Invoke (sync) | Stream (SSE) | MCP | Event Hub | Notes |
|-------|--------|---------------|--------------|-----|-----------|-------|
| ecommerce-catalog-search | OK/FAIL | latency_ms | first_token_ms | OK/FAIL | consumed_s | |
| ... | | | | | | |

## Investigation Playbook

When a test fails, follow this escalation path:

### Level 1: Surface Diagnostics (1-2 min)
```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n holiday-peak-agents -l app={agent-name}
# Check recent logs
kubectl logs -n holiday-peak-agents deployment/{agent-name} --tail=30
# Check APIM proxy
curl -sv "$APIM_BASE/agents/{agent-name}/health" 2>&1 | grep "< HTTP"
```

### Level 2: Dependency Diagnosis (3-5 min)
```bash
# Check Foundry connectivity
kubectl logs -n holiday-peak-agents deployment/{agent-name} --tail=50 | grep -i "foundry\|model\|timeout"
# Check memory tier connectivity
kubectl logs -n holiday-peak-agents deployment/{agent-name} --tail=50 | grep -i "redis\|cosmos\|blob"
# Check Event Hub consumer
kubectl logs -n holiday-peak-agents deployment/{agent-name} --tail=50 | grep -i "event.*hub\|partition\|consumer"
```

### Level 3: Deep Investigation (5-15 min)
```bash
# Full pod describe (events, resource limits, scheduling)
kubectl describe pod -n holiday-peak-agents -l app={agent-name}
# Resource utilization
kubectl top pods -n holiday-peak-agents -l app={agent-name}
# Network connectivity test
kubectl exec -n holiday-peak-agents deployment/{agent-name} -- python -c "import httpx; print(httpx.get('http://crud-service.holiday-peak-crud.svc.cluster.local:8000/api/health').status_code)"
# Self-healing kernel status
curl -s "$APIM_BASE/agents/{agent-name}/self-healing/status"
```

### Level 4: Infrastructure Recovery
If multiple agents fail, return to the Pre-Flight Infrastructure Recovery section and re-run the full recovery script. If the issue persists after recovery, check:
1. AKS node pool health: `kubectl get nodes`
2. PostgreSQL state: `az postgres flexible-server show -g $RG -n $PG --query "state"`
3. Event Hub namespace health: Azure Portal → Event Hubs → Activity log
4. APIM health: Azure Portal → APIM → API health
