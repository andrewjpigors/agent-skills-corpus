  Create, read, update, patch, delete, and manage invoices in the Alliance Business
  Suite (ABS) Invoicing Service via the REST API. Covers invoices, invoice lines,
  line taxes, adjustments (discounts/surcharges), references (credit/debit notes),
  payments, calculations, aggregations, and transactional email notifications,
  including atomic PATCH (JSON Patch) updates. All operations are tenant-scoped and
  require a bearer token (see the absuite-login skill to authenticate).

# Alliance Business Suite — Invoicing Skill (REST)

Manage invoices through the ABS Invoicing Service REST API. Every invoicing endpoint
is tenant-scoped: pass `?tenantId=<tenant-guid>` (or the equivalent `X-TenantId: <tenant-guid>`
header) on **every** request — GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE alike.

> For the CLI equivalent see `absuite-invoicing-cli`; for general REST conventions
> (envelope, tenant scoping, JSON Patch) see `absuite-rest`.

## Authentication

1. **Obtain a bearer token:**
```bash
curl -X POST "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "<your-email>", "password": "<your-password>"}'
```
Extract `accessToken` from the JSON response and export it:
```bash
export ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN="<accessToken-from-response>"
```

2. **Send the token on every subsequent request:**
```bash
-H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

3. **Base path:** `$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/InvoicingService/Invoices`

4. **Response envelope** — every response is wrapped:
```json
{
  "isSuccess": true,
  "errorMessage": null,
  "correlationId": "…",
  "timestamp": "…",
  "result": { }
}
```
Always check `isSuccess`; read the payload from `result` (an object, an array, an int for `Count`, or `null`).

## Key Concepts

- **Invoice** — a formal billing document with header info (customer, currency, totals, status), line items, adjustments, and references.
- **Invoice Line** — an individual item/service billed, with quantity, pricing, and tax info.
- **Invoice Line Tax** — a tax policy applied to a specific invoice line.
- **Invoice Adjustment** — a discount or surcharge applied at the invoice level (percentage or fixed amount).
- **Invoice Reference** — a link between invoices (e.g. a credit note referencing the original invoice).
- **Invoice Payment** — payment records associated with an invoice (read-only here).
- **InvoiceType** — `PurchaseInvoice` | `SalesInvoice` | `CreditNote` | `DebitNote`.
- **DocumentType** — `Standard` | `DebitNote` | `CreditNote`.
- **InvoiceStatus** — lifecycle state: `Draft` | `Closed` | `Signed` | `Expired` | `Paid`.
- **CostCalculationMethod** — `Automatic` | `Custom`.
- **TaxCalculationMethod** — `Included` | `Excluded`.
- **AdjustmentType** (`type` on an adjustment) — `Discount` | `Surcharge`.
- **Enumeration** — invoice number/sequence (auto-generated or from an enumeration range).

> Field names in request bodies are PascalCase JSON keys (e.g. `"Title"`, `"CurrencyId"`,
> `"InvoiceType"`). Monetary amounts are split into a value field and a matching
> `…CurrencyId` field (e.g. `Total` + `TotalCurrencyId`).

## Workflow: Creating an Invoice

1. **Create the invoice header** with customer, currency, and billing info.
2. **Add invoice lines** for each billed item/service.
3. **Add line taxes** to each line (link to tax policies).
4. **(Optional)** Add adjustments (invoice-level discounts/surcharges).
5. **Calculate totals** — let the server compute taxes, discounts, and grand total.
6. **(Optional)** Add references to related invoices.
7. **Patch the status** (e.g. `Draft` → `Signed`) and **send** the invoice via transactional email.

## Invoices

### Create Invoice

```bash
curl -X POST "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/InvoicingService/Invoices?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \

      {
        "itemId": "<item-guid-1>",
        "quantity": 5,
        "currencyId": "<currency-guid>",
        "itemPriceId": "<price-guid-1>",
        "title": "Enterprise License",

`userId`, `billingLocationId`, `shippingLocationId`, `shippingMethodId` (and, like create,
the inline `invoiceLines` / `invoiceReferences` / `invoiceAdjustments` arrays). It does **not**
carry `id`. Prefer PATCH (below) for small, partial edits.

  -d '{
    "quantity": 15,
    "description": "Increased to 15 seats",
    "currencyId": "<currency-guid>"
  }'
```

`InvoiceLineUpdateDto` adds `userId`, `billingLocationId`, `shippingLocationId`,

## Recipe: Issue a Credit Note

```bash
# 1. Create a credit note that references the original invoice (inline reference)
curl -X POST "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/InvoicingService/Invoices?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Credit Note for original invoice",
    "currencyId": "<currency-guid>",
    "individualId": "<contact-guid>",
    "invoiceType": "CreditNote",
    "documentType": "CreditNote",
    "invoiceStatus": "Draft",
    "invoiceReferences": [ { "referencedInvoiceId": "<original-invoice-guid>" } ]
  }'
# Note the returned credit-note ID.

# 2. Add a credit line (negative quantity)
curl -X POST "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/InvoicingService/Invoices/<credit-note-guid>/Lines?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "title": "License (Credit)", "itemId": "<item-guid>", "quantity": -2, "currencyId": "<currency-guid>", "itemPriceId": "<price-guid>" }'

# 3. Calculate
curl -X PUT "$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/InvoicingService/Invoices/<credit-note-guid>/Calculate?tenantId=<tenant-guid>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## End-to-End Workflow

```bash
TENANT="<tenant-guid>"
BASE="$ABSUITE_HOST_URL/api/v2/InvoicingService/Invoices"

# 1. Create the invoice header
curl -X POST "$BASE?tenantId=$TENANT" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Invoice - Q2 Enterprise License",
    "currencyId": "<currency-guid>",
    "individualId": "<contact-guid>",
    "billingEmail": "<billing-email>",
    "invoiceType": "SalesInvoice",
    "invoiceStatus": "Draft",
    "costCalculationMethod": "Automatic",
    "taxCalculationMethod": "Excluded",
    "paymentDue": "2026-07-15T00:00:00Z"
  }'
# -> capture result.id as INVOICE

# 2. Add a line
curl -X POST "$BASE/<invoice-guid>/Lines?tenantId=$TENANT" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "title": "Enterprise License", "itemId": "<item-guid>", "quantity": 10, "currencyId": "<currency-guid>", "itemPriceId": "<price-guid>" }'
# -> capture result.id as LINE

# 3. Apply a tax to the line
curl -X POST "$BASE/<invoice-guid>/Lines/<invoice-line-guid>/Taxes?tenantId=$TENANT" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "taxPolicyId": "<tax-policy-guid>", "invoiceId": "<invoice-guid>" }'

# 4. Add an invoice-level discount
curl -X POST "$BASE/<invoice-guid>/Adjustments?tenantId=$TENANT" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "description": "Volume discount", "discountPercent": 10, "type": "Discount", "currencyId": "<currency-guid>" }'

# 5. Calculate totals
curl -X PUT "$BASE/<invoice-guid>/Calculate?tenantId=$TENANT" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN"

# 6. Patch the status to Signed
curl -X PATCH "$BASE/<invoice-guid>?tenantId=$TENANT" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[ { "op": "replace", "path": "/invoiceStatus", "value": "Signed" } ]'

# 7. Send the invoice email
curl -X POST "$BASE/<invoice-guid>/Emails/Send?tenantId=$TENANT" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "title": "Your invoice", "message": "Please find your invoice below.", "culture": "en-US", "uiCulture": "en-US", "recipients": ["<billing-email>"] }'

# 8. Verify
curl -X GET "$BASE/<invoice-guid>?tenantId=$TENANT" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ABSUITE_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```
