  Process tasks from YouGile Reopened column (failed verification/QA).
  Reads tester feedback from task chat, diagnoses root cause,
  fixes via /nacl:tl-fix, ships via /nacl:tl-ship, closes the verification loop.
  Use when: fix reopened tasks, process QA failures, handle rework,
  or the user says "/nacl:tl-reopened".
---

## Contract

**Inputs this skill consumes:**
- nacl-tl-fix output (six-status vocabulary: PASS / BLOCKED / UNVERIFIED /
  NO_INFRA / RUNNER_BROKEN / REGRESSION; parsed from the authoritative `Status: <VALUE>`
  line in the Step 8 report — report headline is decoration only)
- nacl-tl-review verdict (APPROVED / CHANGES REQUESTED)
- nacl-tl-stubs result (severity counts)

**Outputs this skill produces:**
- Rework report posted to YouGile task chat with `📊 Статус фикса` field
- Status table mirroring nacl-tl-fix Step 7 (one row per substatus encountered)
- Auto-ship gated on fix status == PASS

**Reopened outcome headlines (Step 10):**
| Condition | Headline |
|-----------|----------|
| Fix PASS, suite green, review approved | `REOPENED COMPLETE` |
| Fix BLOCKED, user confirmed proceed | `REOPENED APPLIED — UNVERIFIED` (pre-existing failures) |
| Fix UNVERIFIED (no test exercises change) | `REOPENED HALTED — UNVERIFIED (no regression test)` |
| Fix NO_INFRA | `REOPENED HALTED — NO_INFRA` |
| Fix RUNNER_BROKEN | `REOPENED HALTED — RUNNER_BROKEN` |
| Fix REGRESSION | `REOPENED INCOMPLETE — REGRESSION` |
| Re-run gate fails at Step 8 | `REOPENED INCOMPLETE — REGRESSION` |
| Status: line missing from fix report | `REOPENED HALTED — UNVERIFIED (fix report unparseable)` |
| Regression-test seam absent | `REOPENED HALTED — UNVERIFIED (regression-test seam not honored)` |

**Downstream consumers of this output:**
- Tester (human, via YouGile rework report)
- No automated downstream consumers

**Contract change discipline:**
If this skill's output contract changes — status vocabulary, headline format,
exit codes, or report-field names — every downstream consumer in the list
above must be audited and updated in the same release. The 0.10.0→0.10.1
regression (nacl-tl-reopened broke when nacl-tl-fix changed its output) was
caused by skipping this discipline. Do not ship contract changes without
auditing consumers.

# TeamLead — Reopened Task Handler

## Your Role

You are the **feedback loop closer**. When `/nacl:tl-verify` or `/nacl:tl-qa` moves a task to the Reopened column (failed verification), you pick it up, understand what went wrong from tester feedback, orchestrate the fix, and push it back to DevDone. You close the gap between "verification failed" and "code is fixed."

## Key Principle

```
/nacl:tl-verify ─── FAIL ──→ Reopened column
                              │
/nacl:tl-reopened → /nacl:tl-fix → /nacl:tl-ship → DevDone
                                       │
                          /nacl:tl-verify (re-verify) → PASS → ToRelease
```

You do NOT write fixes yourself — you delegate to `/nacl:tl-fix` (spec-first bug fixing) and `/nacl:tl-ship` (commit + push). Your job is orchestration: fetch context, synthesize the problem, delegate, and report.

---

## Invocation

```
/nacl:tl-reopened                      # Interactive: list reopened tasks, user selects
/nacl:tl-reopened --all                # Process ALL reopened tasks sequentially
/nacl:tl-reopened --task ELE-644       # Process specific YouGile task by code
/nacl:tl-reopened UC028                # Process by UC ID (looks up in YouGile)
/nacl:tl-reopened --yes                # Skip USER GATE, auto-approve plans
/nacl:tl-reopened --auto-ship          # After fix, auto-ship (passes through to /nacl:tl-fix)
/nacl:tl-reopened --dry-run            # Fetch + context + plan only, no changes
```

### Configuration Resolution

| Data | Source priority (check in order, use first found) |
|------|--------------------------------------------------|
| YouGile columns | `config.yaml -> yougile.columns.reopened / in_work / dev_done` |
| Module list | `config.yaml -> modules.*` |
| Module stickers | `config.yaml -> yougile.stickers.module` |
| Test command | `config.yaml -> modules.[name].test_cmd` > workspace `package.json` `scripts.test` (declared only — no `npm test` invention) |
| Build command | `config.yaml -> modules.[name].build_cmd` > workspace `package.json` `scripts.build` (declared only — no `npm run build` invention) |

**Declared commands only.** If neither `config.yaml -> modules.[name].test_cmd` nor the workspace's `package.json` `scripts.test` exists, this skill halts as `REOPENED HALTED — NO_INFRA (scripts.test undeclared)`. The same applies to the build command. The previous `fallback npm test` / `fallback npm run build` clauses are removed (Cross-cutting principle P2).
| Git strategy | `config.yaml -> git.strategy` > `modules.[name].git_strategy` > fallback `"feature-branch"` |
| Base branch | `config.yaml -> git.main_branch` > `modules.[name].git_base_branch` > fallback `"main"` |

If YouGile not configured -> accept task description from user as fallback input.

---

## Workflow: 10 Steps (ALL MANDATORY)

**Before each step, announce it:** "Step N: [NAME]". This ensures no step is skipped.

### Step 1: FETCH — announce: "Step 1: FETCH"

**Goal:** Identify which reopened tasks to process.

1. Read `config.yaml` from project root for YouGile column IDs
2. Fetch tasks from Reopened column:
   ```
   get_tasks(columnId: config.yougile.columns.reopened)
   ```
3. Apply filters:
   - If `--task <CODE>` provided: filter by `idTaskProject` match
   - If UC ID provided (e.g., `UC028`): search task titles/descriptions for the UC reference
   - If `--all`: take all tasks
   - If no arguments: present task list to user, ask which to process

4. If no tasks found in Reopened column:
   ```
   No reopened tasks found. Nothing to process.
   ```
   Stop execution.

**Without YouGile:** If `config.yaml` has no YouGile configured, prompt the user to describe the problem manually. The user's description becomes the "tester feedback" for subsequent steps.

### Step 2: CONTEXT — announce: "Step 2: CONTEXT"

**Goal:** Understand exactly what failed and why, from the full task history.

For each task:

1. **Fetch task details:**
   ```
   get_task(id=<taskId>) -> title, description, stickers
   ```

2. **Fetch ALL chat messages:**
   ```
   get_task_messages(taskId=<id>) -> complete message history
   ```

3. **Parse messages for key markers** (search in order of priority):

   | Marker | Source skill | What to extract |
   |--------|-------------|-----------------|
   | "VERIFICATION REPORT" or "Автоматическая верификация" | /nacl:tl-verify, /nacl:tl-verify-code | Verdict (PASS/FAIL), findings[], data flow issues |
   | "QA REPORT" or "qa-report" | /nacl:tl-qa | Failed scenarios, screenshots, acceptance criteria gaps |
   | `Status: PASS` line | /nacl:tl-fix (Step 8) | Fix level, files changed, regression test path, RED→GREEN |
   | `Status: BLOCKED` line | /nacl:tl-fix (Step 8) | Reason line, pre-existing failure list |
   | `Status: UNVERIFIED` line | /nacl:tl-fix (Step 8) | Reason line (no test exercises the change) |
   | `Status: NO_INFRA` line | /nacl:tl-fix (Step 8) | Affected workspace |
   | `Status: RUNNER_BROKEN` line | /nacl:tl-fix (Step 8) | Runner error detail |
   | `Status: REGRESSION` line | /nacl:tl-fix (Step 8) | New failures introduced, return-to-6f signal |
   | Note: report headline (`FIX COMPLETE`, `FIX APPLIED — UNVERIFIED`, etc.) | decoration only | do NOT classify from headline — parse `Status:` line |
   | "Отчёт разработки" or "Development report" | /nacl:tl-ship, previous /nacl:tl-reopened | What was already attempted, files changed |
   | Other comments | Analyst/PM/User | Additional context, priority notes, clarifications |

4. **Count previous rework iterations:**
   - Search messages for "nacl-tl-reopened" or "Reopened task picked up"
   - If count >= 2: **ESCALATE** — do not auto-fix. Present to user:
     ```
     ⚠️ Task {CODE} has been through nacl-tl-reopened {N} times already.
     Previous fix attempts did not resolve the issue.
     Escalating to user for manual investigation.
     ```
     Stop processing this task. Move to next task (if `--all`).

5. **Synthesize problem description** for `/nacl:tl-fix`:
   - Combine tester verdict, specific findings, file paths, and failed criteria
   - Format as a natural-language problem description (what `/nacl:tl-fix` expects as input)
   - Example: `"nacl-tl-verify found FAIL: API endpoint POST /api/orders returns 500 when order.items is empty (file: src/routes/orders.ts:45). Acceptance criterion AC-3 not met: 'empty cart should show validation error, not crash'."`

### Step 3: DETECT MODULE — announce: "Step 3: DETECT MODULE"

**Goal:** Determine which module(s) the task affects.

Detection priority (use first match):

1. **YouGile sticker:** If task has a module sticker (from `config.yaml -> yougile.stickers.module.states`), use it directly
2. **File paths in findings:** If tester report references specific files (e.g., `src/api/orders.ts`), match against `config.yaml -> modules.[name].path`
3. **Keywords in title/description:** Match against module names and paths from `config.yaml -> modules`
4. **Fallback:** If only one module is configured, use it. If multiple and ambiguous, ask user.

Output:
```
Module detected: {module_name} ({config.yaml -> modules.[name].stack})
Path: {config.yaml -> modules.[name].path}
```

### Step 4: CHECK PATH — announce: "Step 4: CHECK PATH"

**Goal:** Determine whether .tl/ task context exists.

1. Check if `.tl/tasks/` directory exists
2. If it does, search for a matching task:
   - By UC ID: `ls .tl/tasks/ | grep -i UC###`
   - By task code: `grep -r "<TASK_CODE>" .tl/tasks/`
   - By keywords from task title across `task-be.md`, `task-fe.md` files

**Path A — .tl/ task found:**
- Read available context files: `task-be.md`, `task-fe.md`, `acceptance.md`, `api-contract.md`, `result-be.md`, `result-fe.md`, `qa-report.md`
- Cross-reference tester findings with acceptance criteria
- Note which phases previously passed/failed in `.tl/status.json`
- The UC ID becomes the primary identifier for downstream skills

**Path B — no .tl/ context:**
- Task was likely created directly in YouGile (e.g., by /nacl:tl-qa bug auto-creation, or by a human)
- Context comes entirely from YouGile chat messages (Step 2)
- `/nacl:tl-fix` will handle this via its L3 path (no docs for area)

### Step 5: PLAN — announce: "Step 5: PLAN (USER GATE)"

**Goal:** Present the fix plan for user approval.

Display (in user's language):

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  REOPENED TASK — FIX PLAN
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Task: {CODE} — {title}
  Module: {module_name} ({stack})
  Path: {A (has .tl/ context) | B (YouGile-only context)}
  Previous rework attempts: {N}

  Problem (from tester feedback):
    {synthesized problem description from Step 2}

  Fix approach:
    → Delegate to /nacl:tl-fix "{synthesized description}"
    → /nacl:tl-fix will classify (L0/L1/L2/L3) and apply spec-first fix
    → Post-fix: /nacl:tl-review + /nacl:tl-stubs quality gates
    → Ship: /nacl:tl-ship → DevDone

  Affected files (from tester findings):
    - {file1.ts} — {issue description}
    - {file2.tsx} — {issue description}

  Proceed? [yes/no]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**If `--yes` flag:** Skip this step entirely, proceed to Step 6.
**If `--dry-run` flag:** Display plan and STOP. Do not execute Steps 6-10.
**Otherwise:** Wait for user confirmation.

### Step 6: MOVE InWork — announce: "Step 6: MOVE InWork"

**Goal:** Signal that rework has started.

1. Move task to InWork column:
   ```
   update_task(id=<taskId>, columnId: config.yougile.columns.in_work)
   ```

2. Post pickup message to task chat:
   ```
   send_task_message(taskId, "🔄 Reopened task picked up for rework by /nacl:tl-reopened.
   Problem: {brief summary from Step 2}.
   Approach: /nacl:tl-fix → /nacl:tl-review → /nacl:tl-stubs → /nacl:tl-ship")
   ```

If YouGile not configured -> skip column move, log locally.

### Step 7: FIX — announce: "Step 7: FIX"

**Goal:** Fix the issue by delegating to `/nacl:tl-fix`.

Invoke `/nacl:tl-fix` via Skill tool with the synthesized problem description from Step 2:

```
Skill: nacl-tl-fix
Args: "{synthesized problem description}"
```

Add flags as appropriate:
- If `--auto-ship` was passed to `/nacl:tl-reopened`: add `--auto-ship` only if fix status is later confirmed PASS (see Step 7.5)
- If Path A and fix is clearly code-only (tester found a specific code bug, no spec drift): consider `--l1`

**Wait for /nacl:tl-fix to complete.** Capture its full output, including:
- Fix level (L0/L1/L2/L3)
- Files changed
- Tests added/updated
- **`Status: <VALUE>` line** — the six-status value: `PASS / BLOCKED / UNVERIFIED / NO_INFRA / RUNNER_BROKEN / REGRESSION` (this is the authoritative classifier)
- **Regression test path** — from the `Tests: Regression test:` field
- **RED→GREEN field** — from the `Tests: RED→GREEN:` field
- Report headline (`FIX COMPLETE`, `FIX APPLIED — UNVERIFIED`, `FIX INCOMPLETE`) — captured for context but NOT used for classification

Proceed to Step 7.5 immediately after /nacl:tl-fix completes.

### Step 7.5: PARSE FIX STATUS — announce: "Step 7.5: PARSE FIX STATUS"

**Goal:** Branch based on the six-status value from /nacl:tl-fix Step 8.

#### Parsing rule — Status: line is the single source of truth

Scan the /nacl:tl-fix report output for a line matching exactly:

```
Status: <VALUE>
```

where `<VALUE>` is one of: `PASS`, `BLOCKED`, `UNVERIFIED`, `NO_INFRA`, `RUNNER_BROKEN`, `REGRESSION`.

- The `Status:` line is machine-readable and authoritative. The report headline (e.g. `FIX COMPLETE`, `FIX APPLIED — UNVERIFIED`) is **decoration only** — do NOT classify from it.
- If no `Status:` line is found, or the value is not in the vocabulary above:
  ```
  REOPENED HALTED — UNVERIFIED (fix report unparseable)

  The /nacl:tl-fix report contains no parseable "Status: <VALUE>" line.
  Cannot determine fix outcome. Do not ship.

  Action required: re-invoke /nacl:tl-fix and ensure it produces a complete Step 8 report.
  ```
  Post this advisory to YouGile task chat and halt. Do NOT proceed to Step 7.5.1 or Step 8.

Branch on the parsed `<VALUE>`:

---

**Status: PASS** (header: `FIX COMPLETE`)

→ Proceed to Step 8 (review + stubs) and Step 9 (ship).
→ If `--auto-ship` was passed and Step 8 passes, auto-ship is permitted in Step 9.

---

**Status: BLOCKED** (header: `FIX APPLIED — UNVERIFIED`, pre-existing unrelated failures)

The fix was applied and a test transitioned RED→GREEN, but pre-existing unrelated failures remain
in the suite. These are baseline-confirmed (not introduced by this fix).

→ Post advisory to YouGile task chat (see template below).
→ Require explicit user acknowledgment before proceeding to Step 8.
→ Do NOT auto-ship in Step 9 regardless of `--auto-ship` flag.
→ Do NOT invoke /nacl:tl-review or /nacl:tl-stubs automatically; wait for user confirmation.

Advisory template:
```
⚠️ FIX APPLIED — BLOCKED
Fix was applied and its test transitioned RED→GREEN, but pre-existing failures remain in
the suite (baseline-confirmed unrelated to this fix).

Pre-existing failures: {list from nacl-tl-fix report}

Action required: confirm whether to proceed to review and ship with known pre-existing
failures, or investigate the failures first.
  (a) Proceed to review + ship — type "proceed"
  (b) Investigate pre-existing failures first — type "investigate"
```

---

**Status: UNVERIFIED** (header: `FIX APPLIED — UNVERIFIED`, no test exercises the change)

The fix was applied but no test exercises it. The import-grep heuristic found a test that
imports the changed file but the test does not actually cover the bug.

→ Post advisory to YouGile task chat (see template below).
→ Do NOT proceed to auto-review or auto-ship.
→ Escalate to user with explicit message.

Advisory template:
```
⚠️ FIX APPLIED — UNVERIFIED
Fix was applied, but no test exercises the change. The fix cannot be machine-verified.

Reason: {reason line from nacl-tl-fix Step 8}

Options:
  (a) Write a regression test now:
        /nacl:tl-regression-test "{bug description}"
  (b) Accept the unverified fix and proceed manually — confirm "proceed unverified"
```

Do NOT proceed past this advisory without explicit user input.

---

**Status: NO_INFRA** (header: `FIX APPLIED — UNVERIFIED`, no test runner for this layer)

The affected workspace has no `scripts.test`. The fix was applied but cannot be machine-verified.

→ Post advisory to YouGile task chat.
→ Halt further automated steps.
→ Recommend the user adds test infrastructure.

Advisory template:
```
⚠️ FIX APPLIED — NO_INFRA
The workspace containing the changed files has no test runner (scripts.test missing).

Recommended next step:
  /nacl:tl-dev TECH-### "set up test runner for [workspace]"

After test infra is in place, re-run /nacl:tl-fix to add a regression test for this bug.
The fix can ship at your discretion if the change is small enough to review by eye.
```

---

**Status: RUNNER_BROKEN** (header: `FIX APPLIED — UNVERIFIED`, test runner could not execute)

The test runner could not start or execute any tests. This is likely a local L0
environment issue, not a code problem.

→ Post advisory to YouGile task chat.
→ Halt further automated steps.
→ Escalate as an infra problem.

Advisory template:
```
⚠️ FIX APPLIED — RUNNER_BROKEN
The test runner failed to execute. This is an infrastructure problem, not a code problem.

Recommended next step:
  /nacl:tl-diagnose
Do NOT ship the fix until the runner works again — there is no way to verify regressions.
```

---

**Status: REGRESSION** (header: `FIX INCOMPLETE`)

The fix introduced new test failures that were not in the baseline, or the regression test
written for this bug is still RED after the fix was applied.

→ Post failure notice to YouGile task chat.
→ Halt immediately. Do NOT proceed to Step 8 or Step 9.
→ File the new failures as a new bug in YouGile task chat (advisory only — user decides
  whether to open a new task or fold it into the current fix iteration).

Failure notice template:
```
❌ FIX INCOMPLETE — REGRESSION
The fix introduced new test failures not present in the baseline, or the regression test
for this bug is still failing after the fix was applied.

New failures: {list from nacl-tl-fix report}

Action required: return to /nacl:tl-fix Step 6f to correct the fix.
Do NOT ship.
```

---

### Step 7.5.1: VERIFY REGRESSION-TEST SEAM — announce: "Step 7.5.1: VERIFY REGRESSION-TEST SEAM"

**Goal:** Confirm that /nacl:tl-fix honored the test-author seam (Step 6d) by checking its report for regression-test evidence.

**Only execute if Step 7.5 parsed a status other than `NO_INFRA` and other than `RUNNER_BROKEN`.** (Those two statuses cannot produce a regression test by definition — skip this step for them and proceed to Step 8 branching as normal.)

Scan the /nacl:tl-fix Step 8 report for **both** of the following:

1. **Regression-test path** — a file path under the `Tests:` / `Regression test:` section, e.g.:
   ```
   Regression test:  tests/orders/empty-cart.test.ts
   ```
   Accepted forms: any non-empty value that is not `"none — UNVERIFIED"` and not `"n/a — NO_INFRA"`.

2. **RED→GREEN evidence** — a line matching:
   ```
   RED→GREEN:  ✓ ...
   ```
   or prose equivalent confirming the test was RED before the fix and GREEN after.

**If either element is absent:**

```
REOPENED HALTED — UNVERIFIED (regression-test seam not honored)

The /nacl:tl-fix report does not cite a regression-test file path and/or RED→GREEN
transition. The fix-author seam (nacl-tl-regression-test, Step 6d of nacl-tl-fix)
may not have run.

Missing:
  {Regression-test path: absent | RED→GREEN evidence: absent}

Action required:
  (a) Re-invoke /nacl:tl-fix and ensure /nacl:tl-regression-test runs at Step 6d,
      OR
  (b) Manually invoke /nacl:tl-regression-test "{bug description}" to create
      a retroactive regression test, then confirm it transitions RED→GREEN.

Do NOT proceed to review or ship until evidence exists.
```

Post this advisory to YouGile task chat and halt. Do NOT proceed to Step 8.

**If both elements are present:** proceed to Step 8.

---

### Step 8: REVIEW + STUBS — announce: "Step 8: REVIEW + STUBS"

**Precondition:** Only reached if Step 7.5 status is PASS, or the user explicitly confirmed
"proceed" for a BLOCKED fix.

**Re-run gate (mandatory before invoking /nacl:tl-review or /nacl:tl-stubs):**

Re-run the test suite on the current (reopened) branch to guard against environment
drift between the moment /nacl:tl-fix ran and now:

1. Locate the workspace: find the nearest `package.json` walking up from any changed file.
2. Read its `scripts.test`.
3. Run it. Record pass/fail counts.

If the suite **fails**:
```
REOPENED INCOMPLETE — REGRESSION

Tests were passing when /nacl:tl-fix completed, but re-running them on the reopened
branch now produces failures.

Failures:
  {list of failing tests}

Action required: investigate the new failures before proceeding to review.
Do NOT invoke /nacl:tl-review or /nacl:tl-stubs. Do NOT ship.
```
Post this advisory to YouGile task chat and halt.

If `scripts.test` is missing → halt as `REOPENED HALTED — NO_INFRA (scripts.test undeclared)`:

```
REOPENED HALTED — NO_INFRA

Re-run gate cannot execute: the workspace containing the changed files declares
no scripts.test. The previous "proceed to review with a warning" path is removed
(Cross-cutting principle P2 — declared workspace commands only).

Action required:
  /nacl:tl-dev TECH-### "set up test runner for [workspace]"

Do NOT proceed to /nacl:tl-review or /nacl:tl-stubs without a re-run baseline.
```

Post this advisory to YouGile task chat and halt. Do NOT proceed to Step 8 review or Step 9 ship.

If the suite **passes:** proceed to review and stubs below.

**Goal:** Quality gates after the fix.

**Review (Path A with UC ID):**
```
Skill: nacl-tl-review
Args: "UC### --be"    (if BE fix)
Args: "UC### --fe"    (if FE fix)
```

**Review (Path B without UC ID):**
- `/nacl:tl-fix` already includes a validation step (Step 7 in its workflow)
- Run module tests as additional verification:
  ```bash
  cd <module_path> && <test_cmd>
  ```

**Stub scan (Path A):**
```
Skill: nacl-tl-stubs
Args: "UC###"
```

**Stub scan (Path B):**
- Scan changed files:
  ```bash
  grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME\|STUB\|MOCK\|HACK\|throw new Error('Not implemented')\|return {} as any\|console\.log" <changed-files>
  ```
- CRITICAL stubs -> fix before proceeding
- WARNING stubs -> note in report

**Retry loop:** If review rejects, fix issues and re-review. Max 2 retries within nacl-tl-reopened (since /nacl:tl-fix already iterated internally). After 2 rejections:
- Post failure details to YouGile
- Leave in InWork
- Escalate to user

### Step 9: SHIP — announce: "Step 9: SHIP"

**Precondition (auto-ship gate):** Auto-ship is only permitted when Step 7.5 status was PASS.
For BLOCKED fixes that the user confirmed, ship proceeds but without auto-ship — always
require explicit `/nacl:tl-ship` invocation or manual user confirmation.

**If /nacl:tl-fix already shipped via `--auto-ship` AND Step 7.5 status was PASS:** Skip to the DevDone move.

**Otherwise:**
```
Skill: nacl-tl-ship
Args: "{task_code} fix: {brief description from nacl-tl-fix report}"
```

`/nacl:tl-ship` handles:
- Correct git strategy (direct vs feature-branch from config.yaml)
- Commit with descriptive message
- Push to remote (always to the current branch -- ship NEVER switches branches)
- YouGile column move to DevDone

Note: `/nacl:tl-ship` always commits to the current branch per config strategy.
If the reopened fix is critical for production and needs to bypass the feature
branch merge, escalate to the user: "Consider `/nacl:tl-hotfix --apply`
to ship directly to main."

**If /nacl:tl-ship was NOT invoked** (e.g., /nacl:tl-fix auto-shipped with PASS status), move to DevDone manually:
```
update_task(id=<taskId>, columnId: config.yougile.columns.dev_done)
```

**Post development report** to task chat via `send_task_message`:

```

### Step 10: REPORT — announce: "Step 10: REPORT"

**Goal:** Final summary for the user.

**Single task:**

The final `Status:` line is gated on the parsed fix-status. `DevDone ✅` only renders when the headline is `REOPENED COMPLETE` (i.e. fix `Status: PASS` AND re-run suite green AND review approved). All other outcomes render `REOPENED APPLIED — <STATUS>` or `REOPENED HALTED — <STATUS>` and leave the YouGile column at InWork (or as the matching halt state).

  Next step:
    REOPENED COMPLETE              → /nacl:tl-verify {task_code}    # re-verify the fix
    REOPENED APPLIED — UNVERIFIED  → resolve unverified state per advisory; do NOT auto-verify
    REOPENED HALTED — *            → see halt advisory above
    REOPENED INCOMPLETE — REGRESSION → return to /nacl:tl-fix Step 6f

## Batch Mode (--all)

When processing multiple reopened tasks:

1. **Sequential processing** — tasks share a codebase, parallel fixes would conflict
2. **Sub-agents for isolation** — each task's fix cycle (Steps 6-9) runs in a Task agent to preserve context. The sub-agent prompt MUST include the same six-status contract enforced by Step 7.5 and the regression-test-seam gate from Step 7.5.1; otherwise the sub-agent will silently collapse non-PASS statuses into apparent completion:
   ```
   For each task:
     Launch Task agent:
       "Process reopened task {CODE}: {synthesized description}.
        Module: {name}, Path: {A|B}.

        Run, in order:
          1. /nacl:tl-fix "<problem description>" --uc UC### --from-review
          2. Parse the fix report's `Status: {PASS|BLOCKED|UNVERIFIED|NO_INFRA|RUNNER_BROKEN|REGRESSION}`
             line — this is the only authoritative classifier. Headlines are
             advisory.
          3. If no Status: line is parseable → return `REOPENED HALTED —
             UNVERIFIED (fix report unparseable)` and stop.
          4. Verify the regression-test seam (Step 7.5.1):
               - Tests > Regression test:  <path or 'n/a — NO_INFRA'>
               - Tests > RED→GREEN:        <evidence string>
             If the seam is missing for any status other than NO_INFRA /
             RUNNER_BROKEN → return `REOPENED HALTED — UNVERIFIED
             (regression-test seam not honored)` and stop.
          5. Branch on parsed status:
               PASS                     → proceed to Step 8 (review + stubs)
                                          and Step 9 (ship). Auto-ship is
                                          permitted only here.
               BLOCKED                  → require explicit user 'proceed' before
                                          Step 8; auto-ship forbidden.
               UNVERIFIED / NO_INFRA /
               RUNNER_BROKEN / REGRESSION
                                        → halt with the matching `REOPENED
                                          HALTED — <STATUS>` or `REOPENED
                                          INCOMPLETE — REGRESSION` headline; do
                                          NOT advance to /nacl:tl-review,
                                          /nacl:tl-stubs, or /nacl:tl-ship.
          6. On PASS: /nacl:tl-review → /nacl:tl-stubs → /nacl:tl-ship.
        Capture the resolved headline + Status: value as the per-task result."
     Capture result (one of: REOPENED COMPLETE | REOPENED APPLIED — UNVERIFIED |
                            REOPENED HALTED — UNVERIFIED | REOPENED HALTED — NO_INFRA |
                            REOPENED HALTED — RUNNER_BROKEN | REOPENED INCOMPLETE — REGRESSION)
   ```
3. **Continue on failure** — if one task fails, log it and proceed to the next
4. **Aggregate results** in Step 10

## Escalation Rules

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Task has been through /nacl:tl-reopened 2+ times | Escalate to user, do not auto-fix |
| /nacl:tl-fix cannot determine root cause | Post analysis to YouGile, escalate to user |
| /nacl:tl-fix status is REGRESSION | Post failure, halt, do not auto-fix |
| /nacl:tl-fix status is UNVERIFIED | Post advisory, halt, escalate to user |
| /nacl:tl-fix status is NO_INFRA | Post advisory, halt, recommend test infra task |
| /nacl:tl-fix status is RUNNER_BROKEN | Post advisory, halt, escalate as infra problem |
| Review rejected 2 times after fix | Post details, leave in InWork, escalate |
| Fix requires manual actions (env, infra) | Post instructions to YouGile, keep in InWork |
| Git push fails | Post error, keep in InWork, escalate |

Escalation always includes:
- What was attempted
- What went wrong
- Suggested next steps for the human

## Edge Cases

### No YouGile configured
Skip all column movements and chat posting. Accept problem description from user as input (like `/nacl:tl-fix`). Report results locally only.

### No .tl/ directory
Path B workflow. `/nacl:tl-fix` handles the "no docs" case via its L3 classification.

### Task already picked up by another process
If task is NOT in the Reopened column when you try to process it (e.g., moved by another agent or human):
- Log: "Task {CODE} is no longer in Reopened column (current column: {X}). Skipping."
- Move to next task.

### Multiple modules affected
If tester findings reference files in multiple modules:
- Fix the backend module first (data layer)
- Then fix the frontend module (presentation layer)
- Run `/nacl:tl-sync` after both fixes if UC context exists (Path A)

### Task is a TECH task (not UC)
If the task has no UC association:
- Path B applies
- Use `/nacl:tl-fix` as usual — it handles infrastructure bugs too
- Skip `/nacl:tl-review --be/--fe` flags, use plain `/nacl:tl-review`

---

## Without YouGile (Manual Mode)

If the user invokes `/nacl:tl-reopened` without arguments and YouGile is not configured:

```
No YouGile configured. To process a reopened task manually, describe the problem:

  /nacl:tl-reopened "POST /api/orders returns 500 when cart is empty"

This will delegate to /nacl:tl-fix with your description.
```

The skill then runs Steps 5-10 with:
- Step 5: Plan based on user description
- Steps 6, 9 (YouGile): skipped
- Step 7: `/nacl:tl-fix "{user description}"`
- Step 7.5: Parse fix status (mandatory — same branching applies)
- Step 8: Review + stubs (only if Step 7.5 status is PASS or user confirmed BLOCKED)
- Step 10: Local report only
