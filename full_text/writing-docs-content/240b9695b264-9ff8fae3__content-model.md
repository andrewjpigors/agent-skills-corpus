# Crystallize Content Model Skill

Design and implement content structures in Crystallize using a flexible modeling system for products, documents, and taxonomies.

## Consultation Approach

Before designing shapes, understand the business. Ask clarifying questions:

1. **What are you selling or publishing?** Products, articles, courses, services?
2. **How will customers discover items?** Browse categories, search, filter by attributes?
3. **What makes each item unique?** Specs, features, editorial content, variants?
4. **What's shared across items?** Brands, materials, certifications, authors?
5. **Do you need multiple languages/markets?** Which fields vary by language?
6. **What's the scale?** Number of products, categories, content pages?
7. **Do items have relationships?** Bundles, kits, compatibility, recommendations?

Use the answers to choose shape types, decide on classification patterns (topics vs documents), and plan the component structure. A content model that reflects the business intent is more valuable than one that's technically impressive.

## Output Format

The output of this skill is a **mass operations JSON file** — a structured document that creates all shapes and pieces in the correct order.

After generating the mass operations JSON, **always validate it** using the `build-mass-operation` MCP tool. This tool validates against the official `@crystallize/schema` and returns either valid JSON or detailed error feedback. Fix any validation errors before presenting the result.

The mass operations file follows the **4-phase ordering** described in the [Mass Operations section](#mass-operations--4-phase-ordering) below.

## Quick Start Decision Tree

**When designing shapes:**

1. What is the item? → Choose shape type (Product, Document, Folder)
2. What data does it need? → Add components (see [Component Decision Guide](references/components.md))
3. How does it relate to others? → Use Item Relations with `acceptedShapeIdentifiers`
4. Is it part of a classification? → Consider design patterns (see below)

## Core Concepts

### The Five Building Blocks

1. **Shapes** - Blueprints defining item structure (product/document/folder)
2. **Components** - Atomic fields added to shapes (text, numbers, media, relations)
3. **Pieces** - Reusable field sets embedded across shapes
4. **Topic Maps** - Hierarchical taxonomies for classification
5. **Grids** - Curated editorial collections

### Shape Types

| Type     | Purpose                          | Has Variants | Can Have Children | Example                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Product  | Sellable items with pricing      | Yes          | No                | Shoes, Subscription                |
| Document | Editorial content (leaf nodes)   | No           | No                | Article, Brand, FAQ                |
| Folder   | Catalogue hierarchy organization | No           | Yes               | Category, Landing Page, Collection |

### Built-in vs Custom Fields

Every item has built-in fields: `name`, `id`, `language`, `tree`, `topics`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.

Product variants have additional built-ins: `sku`, `images`, `videos`, `price`, `stock`, `attributes`.

**Components are the additional fields you define** beyond these built-ins. For product shapes, use `variantComponents` in the shape definition to add custom components directly to product variants (e.g., custom certifications, variant-level specs).

**`variantComponents` supports all component types**, including structured components: `contentChunk`, `componentChoice`, `componentMultipleChoice`, and `piece` references. This means you can add repeating field groups, polymorphic choices, or reusable pieces directly on variants — not just simple fields like `singleLine` or `numeric`. For example, a product variant can have a `contentChunk` for packaging dimensions, or a `componentChoice` for variant-specific technical specs.

**`variantComponents` require the same type discipline as product-level components** — apply the Component Selection Guide below. Measurable values (weight, voltage, length) → `numeric` with units. Controlled options (connection type, material) → `selection`. Free-form identifiers → `singleLine`. Do not default everything to `singleLine`.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT add components for price or stock - these are native properties managed through the product variant's built-in fields. Only create custom price/stock components for specific edge cases (e.g., tiered pricing models, subscription pricing, price modifiers for configurators).

**Product Identification:** The built-in `sku` field on product variants is the primary product identifier — use it for GTIN, EAN, ISBN, or any single identifier. Do NOT add a separate `gtin` or `ean` single-line component on the variant. If a product needs **multiple identifiers** (e.g., both ISBN-10 and ISBN-13, or a GTIN plus a legacy system ID), add an **identifiers chunk** with named fields to the shape:

```
Product Shape: Book
  └── identifiers (contentChunk)
        ├── isbn-10 (Single Line)
        ├── isbn-13 (Single Line)
        └── legacy-id (Single Line)

Product Shape: Consumer Electronics
  └── identifiers (contentChunk)
        ├── gtin (Single Line)
        ├── ean (Single Line)
        ├── upc (Single Line)
        └── legacy-id (Single Line)
```

Each identifier gets its own named component — not a generic key/value pattern. This keeps the data typed, queryable, and self-documenting. Also useful during migrations to preserve old system identifiers alongside the new SKU.

See [Shapes Reference](references/shapes.md) and [Content Modelling Guide](references/content-modelling.md) for details.

## Component Selection Guide

### "I need to store text"

- **Single Line** → Short, unformatted (subtitle, GTIN, URL)
- **Rich Text** → Formatted content (descriptions, specifications)
- **Paragraph Collection** → Editorial sections with mixed media

### "I need to store numbers"

- **Numeric** → Measurable values with selectable units (e.g. `["g","mg","kg"]` for weight, `["cm","m","in"]` for dimensions). Configure units in `config.numeric.units`.
- **Properties Table** → Arbitrary key-value specs

### "I need to link to other items"

- **Item Relation** → Link to catalogue items (products, documents, folders)
    - **Always use `acceptedShapeIdentifiers`** to restrict which shapes can be linked
    - Set `minItems`/`maxItems` for cardinality constraints
- **Grid Relation** → Link to curated grids

### "I need controlled options"

- **Selection** → Dropdown/checkboxes with predefined options
- **Switch** → Boolean flag
- **Datetime** → Date/timestamp (type: `datetime`)
- **Location** → Geographic coordinates

### "I need to group fields"

- **Chunk (contentChunk)** → Group of related fields (can be repeatable or single)
    - **Use chunk when:** Fields are specific to one location and won't be reused elsewhere
    - **Repeatable chunk:** For lists (ingredients, specifications, USP items, CTA buttons)
        - Examples: Width/Height/Depth (repeating for multiple dimensions), Street/City/Zip (repeating addresses)
    - **Non-repeatable chunk:** For one-time field groups (metadata, settings, single address)
        - Examples: SEO fields (title/description/keywords as one group), single shipping address, contact info block
    - **Decision:** If the group only occurs once in the entire content model → use non-repeatable chunk
    - Can be used inside pieces for nested grouping
    - NOT a direct child of componentMultipleChoice
- **Piece** → Reusable component groups needed in multiple places
    - **Use piece when:** The exact same structure will be used in multiple shapes OR multiple pieces
    - Examples: Banner sections (used across landing pages, products, articles), Hero blocks (reused), Author bios (appears in articles and testimonials)
    - Think: "Will this exact structure be used in 2+ locations?"
    - **Rule:** If only used once → use chunk instead of piece
    - Perfect for componentMultipleChoice options (page builder pattern)
- **Choice** → One of N mutually exclusive forms (polymorphic)
    - **MUST have at least 2 choices** - Single option is invalid
- **Component Choice (componentChoice)** → Similar to choice but for component-level choices
    - **MUST have at least 2 choices** - Single option is invalid
    - **EVERY choice item MUST have a `type` field** - choices with no `type` or with a raw `components` array are invalid API structures
    - When each choice needs multiple fields → create a `piece/upsert` operation for each, then reference with `{ "type": "piece", "config": { "piece": { "identifier": "..." } } }`
- **Multiple Choice (componentMultipleChoice)** → Multiple coexisting forms (page builders)
    - **MUST have at least 2 choices** - Single option is invalid
    - Use when: Editors choose between different content types at the same location
    - **Valid children**: Piece references (`type: "piece"`) or single regular components (images, singleLine, etc.)
    - **NEVER as children**: contentChunk, choice, componentChoice, or nested componentMultipleChoice
    - **NEVER**: anonymous objects with only a `components` array and no `type` field — these are not valid API structures
    - Common pattern: Page sections where each option is a piece (Banner, Hero, USP, Gallery)
    - Examples: Blocks (banner piece, hero piece, usp piece), Content areas (text piece, video piece)

### Structural Component Nesting Rules

**Structural components** = contentChunk, componentChoice, componentMultipleChoice

**Critical Rule**: Structural components can only contain **pieces** or **regular components** (singleLine, richText, numeric, images, etc.) as direct children.

**NEVER nest structural components directly within each other:**

- ❌ componentChoice cannot have componentChoice/componentMultipleChoice/contentChunk as direct children
- ❌ componentMultipleChoice cannot have componentChoice/componentMultipleChoice/contentChunk as direct children
- ❌ contentChunk cannot have componentChoice/componentMultipleChoice/contentChunk as direct children

**Correct pattern for complex structures:**

```
componentChoice/componentMultipleChoice
  └─ Piece (reusable component group)
       └─ contentChunk/componentChoice (now allowed inside piece)
            └─ Regular components
```

**Example - Product Type Selector (CORRECT):**

```json
{
    "id": "type",
    "name": "Product Type",
    "type": "componentChoice",
    "config": {
        "componentChoice": {
            "choices": [
                {
                    "id": "fresh-flowers",
                    "name": "Fresh Flowers",
                    "type": "piece",
                    "config": { "piece": { "identifier": "fresh-flowers-details" } }
                },
                {
                    "id": "arrangement",
                    "name": "Flower Arrangement",
                    "type": "piece",
                    "config": { "piece": { "identifier": "arrangement-details" } }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

## Design Patterns for Relationships

### When to use each pattern?

| Need                                          | Pattern            | Structure                        |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Rich classification (brand, allergen, cert)   | Semantic Bridge    | Item Relation → Document         |
| Relationship with quantity (recipe, BOM, kit) | Quantised Bridge   | Chunk(Numeric + Item Relation)   |
| Relationship with role (contributor, usage)   | Composite Bridge   | Chunk(Item Relation + Selection) |
| Relationship with rules (configurator)        | Conditional Bridge | Chunk(Item Relation + Rule Type) |
| Single concept, multiple forms (instrument)   | Polymorphic Choice | Choice/Multiple Choice → Pieces  |

### Semantic Classification Bridge

**Problem:** Attributes need more than just labels (brands need logos, allergens need warnings).

**Solution:** Create classification document shapes, link via Item Relations.

```json
{
    "id": "brand",
    "type": "itemRelations",
    "config": {
        "itemRelations": {
            "acceptedShapeIdentifiers": ["brand"],
            "minItems": 1,
            "maxItems": 1
        }
    }
}
```

**Key point:** `acceptedShapeIdentifiers` enforces type safety - only "brand" documents can be linked.

### Quantised Classification Bridge

**Problem:** Relationships have measurable quantities (200g flour, 4 screws).

**Solution:** Repeating contentChunk with numeric + item relation.

```json
{
    "id": "ingredients",
    "type": "contentChunk",
    "config": {
        "contentChunk": {
            "repeatable": true,
            "components": [
                { "id": "quantity", "type": "numeric" },
                { "id": "unit", "type": "selection" },
                {
                    "id": "ingredient",
                    "type": "itemRelations",
                    "config": {
                        "itemRelations": {
                            "acceptedShapeIdentifiers": ["ingredient"],
                            "minItems": 1,
                            "maxItems": 1
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Critical: Always Use acceptedShapeIdentifiers

**Without shape restrictions:**

```json
// ❌ Bad - editors can link ANY shape
{
    "type": "itemRelations",
    "config": { "itemRelations": {} }
}
```

**With shape restrictions:**

```json
// ✅ Good - enforces semantic meaning
{
    "type": "itemRelations",
    "config": {
        "itemRelations": {
            "acceptedShapeIdentifiers": ["brand"],
            "minItems": 1,
            "maxItems": 1
        }
    }
}
```

This acts like foreign key constraints in relational databases, preventing data integrity issues.

### Page Builder Pattern (componentMultipleChoice with Pieces)

**Problem:** Editors need flexible page layouts with different section types.

**Solution:** componentMultipleChoice with piece references, each piece containing repeating chunks for items.

```json
// Folder Shape: Landing Page (folders can have children, documents cannot)
{
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "blocks",
      "name": "Page Sections",
      "type": "componentMultipleChoice",
      "config": {
        "componentMultipleChoice": {
          "allowDuplicates": true,
          "choices": [
            { "type": "piece", "config": { "piece": { "identifier": "banner-section" } } },
            { "type": "piece", "config": { "piece": { "identifier": "usp-section" } } },
            { "type": "piece", "config": { "piece": { "identifier": "hero-section" } } }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

// Piece: banner-section
{
  "identifier": "banner-section",
  "name": "Banner Section",
  "components": [
    { "id": "title", "type": "singleLine" },
    { "id": "description", "type": "richText" },
    { "id": "background", "type": "images" },
    {
      "id": "ctas",
      "name": "Call to Actions",
      "type": "contentChunk",
      "config": {
        "contentChunk": {
          "repeatable": true,
          "components": [
            { "id": "text", "type": "singleLine" },
            { "id": "url", "type": "singleLine" }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

// Piece: usp-section
{
  "identifier": "usp-section",
  "name": "USP Section",
  "components": [
    { "id": "title", "type": "singleLine" },
    {
      "id": "items",
      "name": "USP Items",
      "type": "contentChunk",
      "config": {
        "contentChunk": {
          "repeatable": true,
          "components": [
            { "id": "icon", "type": "images" },
            { "id": "title", "type": "singleLine" },
            { "id": "description", "type": "richText" }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key points:**

- componentMultipleChoice contains pieces (banner-section, usp-section, hero-section)
- Each piece contains regular components and repeating chunks for items
- Chunks (CTAs, USP items) are inside pieces, not direct children of componentMultipleChoice
- This allows editors to build pages with flexible, reusable sections

For complete pattern details with examples, see [Design Patterns Reference](references/design-patterns.md).

## Shape Consolidation Strategy

### Minimizing Product and Folder Shapes

**Principle:** Keep the number of product and folder shapes to a minimum by using polymorphic patterns instead of creating separate shapes for similar items.

### When to Consolidate Shapes

**Use the polymorphic product/folder pattern when:**

1. **Similarity threshold**: Two or more product/folder shapes share 50%+ of their components
    - Example: Plant and Vase both have description and SEO components

2. **Common base components**: Shapes have the same foundational components but differ in specialized attributes
    - Common: description, SEO, images, pricing
    - Differ: plant-specific fields (care-level, light-requirement) vs vase-specific fields (material, dimensions)

3. **Semantic similarity**: Items represent variations of the same concept rather than fundamentally different entities
    - Example: Guitar, Amplifier, and Pedal are all music equipment (consolidate into "Music Product")
    - Example: Plant and Vase are both home decor items (consolidate into "Home Decor Product")

### When NOT to Consolidate

**Keep shapes separate when:**

1. **Fundamentally different purposes**: Items serve completely different business functions
    - Product vs Folder (different shape types)
    - Apparel vs Digital Download (different fulfillment, no pricing overlap)

2. **Low component overlap**: Less than 30% of components are shared
    - Consolidation would create a confusing, bloated shape

3. **Different business logic**: Items require distinct workflows, permissions, or integrations
    - Separate checkout flows
    - Different inventory systems
    - Distinct pricing models

4. **Editor clarity**: The consolidated shape would confuse content editors
    - Too many conditional fields make editing difficult

### Consolidation Approach

**Step 1: Identify common components**

- Extract all shared components (description, SEO, images, etc.)
- These become the base components of the consolidated shape

**Step 2: Create a type selector**

- Add a selection component to distinguish between variants
- Example: `product-type` with options "plant", "vase", "bundle"

**Step 3: Extract variant-specific attributes into pieces**

- Create separate pieces for each variant's unique components
- Example: `plant-attributes` piece, `vase-attributes` piece

**Step 4: Use choice component for polymorphic structure**

- Add a choice component that conditionally shows the appropriate piece based on the type selection

### Example: Consolidating Plant and Vase into Product

**Before consolidation (2 shapes):**

```
Shape: Plant (product)
  ├── description (richText)
  ├── care-level (itemRelations → care-level docs)
  ├── light-requirement (selection)
  ├── mature-size (selection)
  └── seo (piece)

Shape: Vase (product)
  ├── description (richText)
  ├── material (itemRelations → material docs)
  ├── dimensions (contentChunk)
  └── seo (piece)
```

**After consolidation (1 shape + 2 pieces):**

```json

                            }
                        }

**Benefits:**

- Single product shape instead of multiple
- Shared components (description, SEO) defined once
- Type-specific attributes cleanly separated into pieces
- Easier to maintain and extend
- Clearer information architecture

**Trade-offs:**

- Slightly more complex for editors (choice component requires selecting variant type)
- Frontend may need to handle polymorphic structure
- Only worthwhile when shapes share significant overlap

### Mass Operations Pattern for Consolidated Shapes

When using the 4-phase ordering with consolidated shapes:

1. **Phase 1**: Create variant-specific pieces (plant-attributes, vase-attributes)
2. **Phase 2**: Create consolidated shape container
3. **Phase 3**: Add components to variant pieces
4. **Phase 4**: Add components (including choice with piece references) to consolidated shape

This ensures all piece references in the choice component resolve correctly.

## Common Use Cases

### Standard SEO Piece

A reusable piece for SEO metadata, commonly added to products, folders (landing pages), and documents (articles):

```json
{
    "identifier": "seo",
    "name": "SEO",
    "components": [
        { "id": "title", "name": "Title", "type": "singleLine" },
        { "id": "description", "name": "Description", "type": "richText" },
        { "id": "image", "name": "Image", "type": "images" }
    ]
}
```

Usage in a shape:

```json
{
    "id": "seo",
    "name": "SEO",
    "type": "piece",
    "config": { "identifier": "seo" }
}
```

### E-commerce Product with Variants

```
Product Shape: Clothing
  ├── Description (Rich Text, translatable)
  ├── Material (Item Relations → material documents, acceptedShapeIdentifiers: ["material"])
  ├── Brand (Item Relations → brand document, acceptedShapeIdentifiers: ["brand"], min:1, max:1)
  └── Care Instructions (Rich Text, translatable)

Variant-level (built-in):
  ├── Size (attribute)
  ├── Color (attribute)
  ├── SKU (built-in)
  ├── Images (built-in)
  └── Price (built-in)
```

### Recipe with Ingredients

```
Document Shape: Recipe
  ├── Description (Rich Text)
  ├── Ingredients (contentChunk, repeating)
  │     ├── Quantity (Numeric)
  │     ├── Unit (Selection: g, ml, pcs)
  │     └── Ingredient (Item Relations → ingredient products, acceptedShapeIdentifiers: ["ingredient"])
  └── Allergens (Item Relations → allergen documents, acceptedShapeIdentifiers: ["allergen"])
```

### Blog Post with Topics

```
Document Shape: Blog Post
  ├── Hero Image (Images)
  ├── Content (Paragraph Collection)
  ├── Author (Item Relations → author document, acceptedShapeIdentifiers: ["author"])
  ├── SEO (Piece → seo-metadata)
  └── topics → Category topic map, Tags topic map
```

### Product Configurator

```
Product Shape: Configurable Product
  └── Options (contentChunk, repeating)
        ├── Option (Item Relations → option products, acceptedShapeIdentifiers: ["option"])
        └── Quantity (Numeric)

Document Shape: Configuration Rule
  ├── If Option (Item Relations → option, acceptedShapeIdentifiers: ["option"])
  ├── Rule Type (Selection: requires, excludes, optional)
  └── Then Option (Item Relations → option, acceptedShapeIdentifiers: ["option"])
```

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

1. **Use normalcase for identifiers** - Shape and component identifiers should be lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `product-page`, `hero-section`)
2. **Be concise, use hierarchy** - Let the structure provide context. Use `title` not `product-page-hero-section-title`
3. **Don't repeat container names** - Within a piece called `seo`, use `title` not `seo-title`. The piece name provides context.
4. **Use semantic names** - Name components for what they represent, not how they're displayed
5. **Avoid redundant prefixes** - Bad: "Meta Title", "Meta Description". Good: "Title", "Description" (when inside SEO piece)
6. **Keep names simple and direct** - Bad: "Social Share Image". Good: "Image" (context is clear from parent)

**Example - SEO Piece Naming:**

```
Piece: "SEO"  (not "SEO Metadata")
  ├─ title  (not "meta-title" or "Meta Title")
  ├─ description  (not "meta-description")
  └─ image  (not "social-share-image" or "og-image")
```

### Design Principles

1. **Start with intent, not structure** - Understand what you're modeling before creating shapes
2. **Use pieces for shared fields** - SEO, environmental data, common metadata
3. **Always restrict item relations** - Use `acceptedShapeIdentifiers` to enforce type safety
4. **Set min/max constraints** - Guide editors with cardinality rules (minItems, maxItems)
5. **Keep shapes focused** - One shape per logical content type
6. **Consolidate similar shapes** - When classification documents share the same structure (e.g., "Coffee Origin" and "Tea Origin" both need name, description, image), combine them into a single shape ("Origin") and differentiate via folder placement or topic tags
7. **Use chunks for grouping** - Related fields that repeat together
8. **Choose topics vs documents wisely** - Simple labels → topics, rich content → documents
9. **Plan localization early** - Enable `isTranslatable` from the start
10. **Mark fields discoverable** - Enable for filtering/search in Discovery API
11. **Apply design patterns** - Use established patterns for scalable models

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Item Relations without acceptedShapeIdentifiers** - Allows linking any shape, breaks semantic meaning

❌ **Using Item Relations for simple labels** - Use Topic Maps instead (better performance, simpler)

❌ **Flat component lists** - Group related fields with Chunks for better structure

❌ **Flat singleLine variant components** - `variantComponents` follow the same type rules as product-level components. Voltage, length, weight → `numeric` with units. Connection type, material, animal version → `selection` with options. Only use `singleLine` for genuinely free-form text (a color label, a custom code). A variant story full of `singleLine` is a modeling smell.

❌ **Mixing variant data with product data** - Use variant attributes (built-in) for size/color/sku

❌ **Adding GTIN/EAN/ISBN as a variant component** - The built-in `sku` field handles single product identifiers. For multiple identifiers, add a chunk with named single-line components (e.g., `isbn-10`, `isbn-13`, `gtin`, `ean`, `upc`, `legacy-id`) at the shape level, not on the variant.

❌ **Adding price or stock components to product shapes** - Products have native `price` and `stock` fields on variants. Only add custom pricing/stock components for specific edge cases (tiered pricing, subscription models, configurator price modifiers, bulk discounts)

❌ **Selection for expandable values** - Use documents + item relations for brands/categories that grow

❌ **Not planning for localization** - Adding multilingual support later requires migration

❌ **Using contentChunk as direct child of componentMultipleChoice** - Chunks should be inside pieces, not direct children

❌ **Using choice/componentChoice as direct children of componentMultipleChoice** - Choices cannot be nested directly

❌ **Nesting structural components directly** - componentChoice, componentMultipleChoice, and contentChunk can only have pieces or regular components as direct children, never other structural components. Use pieces as intermediaries.

❌ **Choice items without a `type` field** - Every item in a `choices` / `componentConfigs` array MUST have a `type` field. Objects like `{ "id": "smartphone", "name": "Smartphone", "components": [...] }` are INVALID — the `components` key does not exist on a choice item and `type` is missing. If a choice needs multiple fields, create a separate piece and reference it with `{ "type": "piece", "config": { "piece": { "identifier": "smartphone-spec" } } }`.

❌ **Polymorphic Choice with inline component groups** - When different choice variants (e.g. Smartphone, Laptop, Headphones) each need their own set of fields, **do NOT** embed a `components` array directly on the choice object. This is the most common componentChoice mistake. **Always** create a `piece/upsert` operation for each variant and reference the piece. Example: `{ "type": "piece", "config": { "piece": { "identifier": "smartphone-spec" } } }` where `smartphone-spec` is a separate piece containing Screen Size, Storage, OS fields.

❌ **CTA/USP items as componentMultipleChoice choices** - These should be repeating chunks inside a piece, not top-level choices

❌ **Single-choice configurations** - Choice components (choice, componentChoice, componentMultipleChoice) MUST have at least 2 options. Single option is invalid. If you only have one option, use a direct piece reference instead of wrapping it in a componentChoice.

❌ **Wrapping single piece in componentChoice** - If a component only needs one piece (e.g., CTA), add the piece directly. Don't use `componentChoice` with one option.

❌ **Empty contentChunk (no components)** - A `contentChunk` with zero child components is meaningless and invalid. Always define at least 1 component inside a chunk. If you find yourself creating an empty chunk, reconsider the design.

See [Content Modelling Guide](references/content-modelling.md) for detailed anti-patterns and migration strategies.

## Mass Operations — 4-Phase Ordering

When creating shapes and pieces via mass operations (Bulk Task API), use a **4-phase ordering** to handle cross-references and relations correctly.

### Phase Order

1. **Create empty pieces** → `intent: "piece/upsert"` (identifier + name, NO `components`)
2. **Create empty shapes** → `intent: "shape/upsert"` (identifier + name + type, NO `components`/`variantComponents`)
3. **Add components to pieces** → `intent: "piece/upsert"` (identifier + name + `components`)
4. **Add components to shapes** → `intent: "shape/upsert"` (identifier + name + type + `components`/`variantComponents`)

**REQUIRED FIELDS**:

- All upsert operations MUST include `identifier` and `name`
- Shape upserts MUST include `type`

**How upsert works:** Multiple operations with the same `identifier` will update the same resource. Phase 1-2 create containers, phase 3-4 populate them with components.

### Why This Order?

Components can reference pieces (via `type: "piece"`) and shapes (via `itemRelations` with `acceptedShapeIdentifiers`). By creating containers first (phases 1-2), then populating them with components that may contain references (phases 3-4), all references resolve correctly.

### Example Operations File

```json
{
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "operations": [
        // Phase 1: Create piece containers (no components)
        {

                            "maxItems": 1,
                            "acceptedShapeIdentifiers": ["brand"]
                        }
                    }
                }
            ],

                },
                {

                            "options": [
                                { "key": "black", "value": "Black" },
                                { "key": "white", "value": "White" }
                            ]
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "intent": "shape/upsert",
            "identifier": "brand",
            "name": "Brand",
            "type": "document",
            "components": [
                { "id": "description", "name": "Description", "type": "richText" },
                { "id": "logo", "name": "Logo", "type": "images" }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

**Note:** Using `piece/upsert` or `shape/upsert` in a single operation (without the 4-phase split) will work ONLY if there are no cross-references. When pieces reference other pieces or shapes reference pieces/other shapes, the 4-phase order is required.

## Validation Checklist

Before presenting the mass operations JSON, verify:

1. **Validate with `build-mass-operation` tool** — Run the operations array through the MCP tool and fix any schema errors. This is the source of truth.
2. **`acceptedShapeIdentifiers`** on every `itemRelations` component — no untyped relations
3. **No structural nesting violations** — `contentChunk`, `componentChoice`, `componentMultipleChoice` cannot be direct children of each other
4. **Every `contentChunk` has at least 1 component** — empty chunks are invalid
5. **Every `componentChoice`/`componentMultipleChoice` has at least 2 choices** — single-choice is invalid
6. **No custom price/stock components** on product shapes — these are built-in on variants
7. **`paragraphCollection` config always has `multilingual` array** — this is required, not optional (use `[]` for no localization, `["title", "body", "images", "videos"]` for full localization)
8. **`datetime` config uses only valid fields** — `required`, `discoverable`, `multilingual` only. There is no `format` field.
9. **`files` config**: if `acceptedContentTypes` is provided, each entry needs `contentType` (required). If `maxFileSize` is provided, both `size` and `unit` are required.
10. **Naming conventions** — all identifiers use lowercase-with-hyphens (no camelCase, no underscores)
11. **Reusable SEO piece** — create an SEO piece and reference it from multiple shapes
12. **Localization strategy** — translatable for marketing text, non-translatable for universal data (codes, dimensions)

## Examples by Industry

**Fashion:** Product with variants (size/color), material classifications, brand documents, care instructions

**Food/Recipe Domain:** Complete model using Quantised Bridge pattern:

```
Product Shape: Ingredient
  ├── Description (Rich Text)
  ├── Nutrition (Piece → nutrition)
  └── Allergens (Item Relations → allergen docs, acceptedShapeIdentifiers: ["allergen"])

Product Shape: Recipe
  ├── Description (Rich Text)
  ├── Prep Time (Numeric, unit: minutes)
  ├── Cook Time (Numeric, unit: minutes)
  ├── Servings (Numeric)
  ├── Ingredients (contentChunk, repeating) ← Quantised Bridge
  │     ├── Quantity (Numeric)
  │     ├── Unit (Selection: g, ml, pcs, tbsp, tsp, cup)
  │     └── Ingredient (Item Relations → ingredient, acceptedShapeIdentifiers: ["ingredient"])
  ├── Instructions (Paragraph Collection)
  └── Allergens (Item Relations → allergen docs, computed from ingredients)

Product Shape: Meal Kit
  ├── Description (Rich Text)
  ├── Recipes (contentChunk, repeating) ← Quantised Bridge
  │     ├── Servings (Numeric)
  │     └── Recipe (Item Relations → recipe, acceptedShapeIdentifiers: ["recipe"])
  └── Dietary Tags (Item Relations → dietary docs)

Document Shape: Allergen
  ├── Icon (Images)
  ├── Warning Text (Rich Text)
  └── Severity (Selection: mild, moderate, severe)

Piece: nutrition
  ├── Calories (Numeric, unit: kcal)
  ├── Protein (Numeric, unit: g)
  ├── Carbs (Numeric, unit: g)
  └── Fat (Numeric, unit: g)
```

This pattern enables: ingredient → recipe → meal kit composition with quantity tracking at each level, automatic allergen rollup, and nutrition calculation.

**Electronics:** Product with configuration options, compatibility rules, technical specs, brand classifications

**Music/Instruments:** Guitar store example using Semantic Bridge pattern:

```
Product Shape: Guitar
  ├── Description (Rich Text)
  ├── Body Type (Item Relations → body-type docs, acceptedShapeIdentifiers: ["body-type"])
  ├── Pickup Configuration (Item Relations → pickup docs, acceptedShapeIdentifiers: ["pickup"])
  ├── Wood Type (Item Relations → wood docs, acceptedShapeIdentifiers: ["wood"])
  ├── Brand (Item Relations → brand doc, acceptedShapeIdentifiers: ["brand"], min:1, max:1)
  └── SEO (Piece → seo)

Classification Documents:
  ├── body-type: Stratocaster, Les Paul, Telecaster, SG...
  ├── pickup: Single Coil, Humbucker, P90, Active...
  ├── wood: Alder, Mahogany, Maple, Rosewood...
  └── brand: Fender, Gibson, PRS, Ibanez...
```

This pattern allows rich content for each classification (e.g., brand logo, wood tone characteristics) while maintaining type safety through `acceptedShapeIdentifiers`.

**B2B:** Service packages with tiers, case studies, industry classifications, expertise levels

**Publishing:** Books with contributors (composite bridge), series, publishers, multi-format variants
