# Ketchup — Perspective-Shaped Technical Research

Research and report on technologies, skills, or concepts, shaped for the reader's professional background. Outputs are citation-backed, inference-flagged, and formatted for Obsidian. Supports opt-in MCP plugin prefetch and knowledge-staleness calibration.

## Arguments

| Flag | Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|------|---------|---------|
| `--occ` | Quoted string | Reader's occupation/role — shapes vocabulary, analogies, assumed knowledge | `--occ "Windows Systems Engineer"` |
| `--tgt` | Quoted string | Topic to research and report on | `--tgt "SELinux Administration"` |
| `--plugin` | Comma-separated string | MCP data sources for prefetch (opt-in) | `--plugin "Context7,Microsoft Docs"` |
| `--time` | Integer (years) | Knowledge staleness — years since last deep engagement | `--time 6` |
| `--registry` | Subcommand | Manage plugin registry: `list`, `add <name>`, `remove <name>` | `--registry list` |
| `--reset` | Flag (no value) | Clear session state (occ, time, plugins) mid-conversation | `--reset` |
| `--fmt` | String (`obsidian` \| `notebook`) | Output format — default `obsidian` | `--fmt notebook` |
| `--kernel` | String (`python` \| `bash`) | Kernelspec for notebook code cells — default `python` | `--kernel bash` |
| `--annotate` | File path (`.ipynb`) | Reprocess a ketchup notebook for `%%ketchup` queries | `--annotate ./report.ipynb` |

### Parsing Rules

1. **Quoted values** — Extract string between quotes: `--occ "Windows Systems Engineer"` → `Windows Systems Engineer`
2. **Unquoted values** — Consume everything from flag to next `--` flag or end of input: `--occ Network Engineer --tgt Kubernetes` → occ=`Network Engineer`, tgt=`Kubernetes`
3. **Single-dash typos** — Accept `-occ`, `-tgt`, `-plugin`, `-time` as aliases for double-dash forms
4. **Repeated flags** — Last value wins. Confirm the update: "Perspective updated to: {new value}"
5. **Neither flag provided** — Check `.ketchup` config files for defaults (see Config section). If no config, display usage summary and prompt user
6. **Flag order** — Irrelevant. `--tgt X --occ Y` and `--occ Y --tgt X` are identical
7. **`--plugin` parsing** — Split on commas, trim whitespace: `"Context7, Microsoft Docs"` → `["context7", "microsoft-docs"]`
8. **`--time` validation** — Must be a non-negative integer (0-50 reasonable range). Reject negative numbers, decimals, and non-numeric values with: "Invalid --time value. Provide a whole number of years (e.g., `--time 6`)."
9. **`--tgt` validation** — Must be a non-empty string. Reject empty/whitespace-only values: "No topic provided. Use `--tgt` with a topic string." If the value exceeds ~30 words, warn: "Topic is very broad — consider narrowing, or I'll scope it during decomposition."
10. **`--plugin` replacement warning** — When `--plugin` on the CLI replaces a config-file plugin list, confirm what was replaced: "CLI `--plugin` overrides config. Using: {cli list}. Config had: {config list}. To use both, combine them: `--plugin 'Context7,Microsoft Docs'`."
11. **`--reset`** — Clears session state (`--occ`, `--time`, `--kernel`, active plugins) without restarting. Confirm: "Session state cleared. Set `--occ` to begin."
12. **`--fmt` validation** — Accepts `obsidian` or `notebook`. Any other value: "Invalid `--fmt` value. Use `obsidian` or `notebook`." Default is `obsidian` if omitted.
13. **`--kernel` validation** — Accepts `python` or `bash`. Any other value: "Invalid `--kernel` value. Use `python` or `bash`." Requires `--fmt notebook` — reject otherwise: "The `--kernel` flag requires `--fmt notebook`." Default is `python` if omitted.
14. **`--annotate` validation** — Path must end in `.ipynb`: "The `--annotate` flag requires a `.ipynb` file path." Standalone mode — reject if combined with `--tgt`, `--occ`, `--fmt`, or `--kernel`: "The `--annotate` flag is a standalone mode — it inherits perspective and kernel from the notebook metadata."
15. **`--fmt` not stored** — Like `--tgt`, `--fmt` is always per-invocation. Never stored in `.ketchup` config.
16. **`--kernel` in config** — May be stored in `.ketchup` config under the `kernel` key. CLI `--kernel` overrides config.

## `.ketchup` Config File

Persistent defaults for `--occ`, `--plugin`, and `--time`. Users edit these files directly.

**Hierarchy:** `~/.ketchup` (global) < `<project>/.ketchup` (project override). Project values **replace** global values per-key (not deep-merged).

**Project config search:** Starting from cwd, walk up parent directories looking for `.ketchup`. Stop at the git root (if in a repo) or the filesystem root (if not). First match wins.

```yaml
# ~/.ketchup (global defaults)
occ: "Windows Systems Engineer"
time: 6
kernel: python
plugins:
  - context7

# <project>/.ketchup (project override)
occ: "Cloud Infrastructure Engineer"
kernel: bash
plugins:
  - context7
  - microsoft-docs
```

**Resolution order:**
1. CLI flags (always win)
2. Project `.ketchup`
3. Global `~/.ketchup`
4. No defaults — prompt user

**Rules:**
- `--plugin` on CLI replaces config `plugins` (not appends)
- `--time 0` explicitly means "current practitioner" (overrides config)
- Omitting `--time` entirely (no CLI, no config) = assume current knowledge
- Config `plugins` is a YAML list; `--plugin` is a comma-separated string. Both resolve to the same internal list.
- `--tgt` is never stored — always per-invocation
- `--kernel` defaults to `python` if absent from CLI and config
- `--fmt` and `--annotate` are never stored — always per-invocation

```

- **`--occ` only:** Set the session perspective. Confirm it. No report generated.
- **`--tgt` only (prior `--occ` or config exists):** Confirm active perspective ("Using perspective: {occ}"), then generate report.
- **`--tgt` only (no prior `--occ`, no config):** Ask the user for their occupation. Treat their reply as the `--occ` value (with or without flag syntax). Confirm, then proceed.
- **Both flags:** Set perspective, then immediately generate the report.
- **Neither flag, no config:** Display usage summary with examples. Prompt for at least `--occ`.
- **Neither flag, config exists:** Load config defaults. Confirm: "Loaded defaults from {config path}: occ={occ}, plugins={list}, time={N}. Provide `--tgt` to generate a report."
- **`--registry` flag:** Execute registry subcommand (list/add/remove) and exit. No research pipeline.
- **`--annotate <path>`:** Standalone mode. Loads notebook metadata (perspective, staleness, plugins, topic) from the `.ipynb` file. Scans for `%%ketchup` query cells. Dispatches annotation agents. Inserts responses. See `notebook-format.md`.
- **`--fmt notebook` (with `--tgt`):** Full research pipeline runs normally through Steps 1-3. Step 4 delegates to `notebook-format.md` for notebook generation instead of Obsidian output. Step 5 verification runs on the synthesized draft before format conversion.
- **`--fmt obsidian` or omitted:** Existing behavior, unchanged.

## Session Perspective (`--occ` + `--time`)

When `--occ` is set, ALL ketchup outputs for the rest of the session adopt this lens:

1. **Vocabulary bridging** — Map unfamiliar concepts to equivalents the reader already knows. A Windows sysadmin learning SELinux gets analogies to Windows MIC/integrity levels and GPO. A frontend dev learning Kubernetes gets analogies to component lifecycles and routing.
2. **Assumed knowledge** — Don't explain what the occupation already implies. A DBA doesn't need "a database stores data." A network engineer doesn't need TCP explained.
3. **Practical framing** — Lead with what this means for someone in their role. Why would they encounter this? What problems does it solve that they'd recognize?
4. **Risk & consequence calibration** — Match how risks are presented to the reader's occupational relationship with failure. A sysadmin with production responsibility gets explicit "this will break SSH" warnings. A student exploring gets "here's what breaks and why" framing.
5. **Preemptive misconception correction** — Anticipate wrong mental models the `--occ` reader will carry in. A Windows engineer will assume SELinux is like Windows Defender (it isn't). Address these in a dedicated "What This Is NOT" subsection before they calcify.

### Knowledge Staleness (`--time`)

When `--time N` is set (N = years since last deep engagement):

- **Anchor vocabulary to the era** — Bridge from tools/patterns current N years ago, not today's stack. A Windows sysadmin with `--time 6` gets Server 2019 / PowerShell 5.1 as baseline, not Server 2025 / PowerShell 7.
- **Explicit change markers** — "You may remember X — since then, Y has replaced it" or "This didn't exist N years ago: [brief context]"
- **Don't assume recent knowledge** — Anything that emerged within the `--time` window needs introduction, even if `--occ` would normally imply familiarity
- **Calibrate density** — 2 years stale = light catch-up. 10 years stale = foundational re-orientation.

If `--time` is omitted (no CLI, no config), assume current practitioner.

### Session State

- `--occ` and `--time` are held in **conversation context only** — no persistent variable store.
- Each new `--occ` invocation **replaces** the previous value (not stacked). Same for `--time`.
- Before launching any `--tgt` pipeline, **confirm the active perspective** in one line: "Using perspective: {occ} | Staleness: {time}yr | Plugins: {list}. Generating report..."
- If context suggests a prior `--occ` may have scrolled out of the window, ask the user to confirm before proceeding.

## Research Pipeline (`--tgt`)

When `--tgt` is provided, execute a multi-agent research pipeline:

### Step 1: Scope and decompose the topic

**Scope check first:**
- If `--tgt` is very narrow (single command, single flag): use 1-2 deep facets. Don't force artificial breadth.
- If `--tgt` is very broad (entire domain like "Cloud Computing"): **ask the user to narrow it** when the topic spans 3+ unrelated subtopics with no clear shared focus. **Scope autonomously** when the subtopics are related and the `--occ` context provides a natural lens to prioritize through (e.g., "Cloud Computing" for a DBA → scope to managed database services, not all of cloud).

**Decompose using standard lenses** — select the 2-6 most relevant for this `--occ`/`--tgt` combination:

| Lens | When to include |
|------|----------------|
| What it IS (conceptual model) | Always — foundational |
| How it maps to what `--occ` already knows | Always — ketchup's core value |
| Day-to-day operations (commands, workflows) | When `--tgt` involves tooling |
| Troubleshooting and failure modes | When `--occ` will operate/maintain this |
| Integration with adjacent tools `--occ` uses | When clear ecosystem overlap exists |
| Security and compliance implications | When `--occ` has operational responsibility |
| Performance and scaling considerations | When `--occ` works at scale |
| Migration or adoption path | When `--occ` is transitioning from something else |

Prefer fewer, deeper facets over many shallow ones. Bias toward facets that answer: "what would trip up a {--occ} specifically?"

### Step 1.5: Plugin pre-fetch (if any plugins active)

**Subagents cannot access MCP tools.** The orchestrator must fetch documentation before dispatch.

If no plugins are active (no `--plugin`, no config), skip this step entirely.

**Discovery-first resolution** — tool names vary across environments (Claude Code, claude.ai, Copilot, etc.), so always resolve tools at runtime:

For each active plugin:
1. Normalize the plugin name (lowercase, trim whitespace, replace spaces with hyphens)
2. **Discover available tools** — scan all available MCP tools for names containing the normalized plugin name (e.g., `"context7"` matches any tool with `context7` in its name, regardless of prefix). This works across all environments.
3. **Match workflow from registry** — look up in plugin registry (check in order: `<project>/.ketchup-plugins.yaml`, then `~/.ketchup-plugins.yaml`, then the shipped `plugin-registry.yaml`). If found, use the registry's `workflow` entries to determine the order and purpose of tool calls. Each workflow entry has a `hint` (a substring to match against discovered tool names) and an `action` (what the tool call accomplishes). For each workflow step, find the discovered tool whose name contains the `hint` substring.
4. If registry entry found but a `hint` matches no discovered tool: skip that workflow step with a warning. If ALL hints fail, fall through to best-effort (step 5).
5. If no registry entry exists: **best-effort fallback** — use the discovered tools directly. Read MCP server instructions from the system prompt to determine call order and parameters. Warn: "No registry entry for '{name}' — discovered {N} MCP tools matching '{pattern}'. Attempting best-effort prefetch."
6. If discovery finds no tools at all: warn and skip: "No MCP tools found matching '{name}'. Proceeding without this plugin."

Call with per-facet focused query strings (e.g., "SELinux policy types" not just "SELinux").

Tag each plugin's results with its name for subagent citation.

### Step 2: Two-pass research with parallel agents

Research uses two passes to control cost — cheap extraction first, then perspective shaping.

**Dispatch table** — consult before every `Agent()` call:

| Pass | Agent role | Model | Input | Output | Condition |
|------|-----------|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Fact extraction | **haiku** | facet + topic + plugin docs | Raw facts, sources, commands, comparisons (no perspective shaping) | Always — one per facet, parallelize all |
| 2 | Perspective shaping | **sonnet** | Pass 1 output + occ + time | Shaped prose with vocabulary bridging, analogies, risk calibration | Always — one per facet, parallelize all |
| 2 | Perspective shaping | **opus** | Pass 1 output + occ + time | Shaped prose (complex facets) | Only if facet covers >3 subtopics or cross-domain synthesis is required |
| Annotate | Annotation response | **sonnet** | query + context cells + occ + time + plugin docs | Shaped prose response, 200-600 words | `--annotate` mode — one per `%%ketchup` query, parallelize all |

**Pass 1 — Fact extraction (haiku, parallel, one per facet):**

Each agent receives the facet, topic, and pre-fetched plugin docs. It does NOT receive `--occ` or `--time` — its job is raw research, not shaping.

```
You are a fact-extraction agent. Your task:

FACET: {facet_description}
TARGET TOPIC: {tgt_value}

{If plugin docs were pre-fetched for this facet:}
PREFETCHED DOCUMENTATION ({plugin_name}):
{results}
Use this as an authoritative source. Cite as ({plugin_name}).

Research this facet using web search. Collect:
- Key facts, definitions, and concepts
- Commands, configurations, and code examples
- Comparisons to related technologies
- Common pitfalls and failure modes
- Version history and recent changes

CITATION RULES (mandatory — apply to EVERY factual claim):
- Verifiable fact with URL → hyperlink inline: "claim ([source](url))"
- Fact, no URL available → append _(unsourced)_
- Inference/probability → append _(~inferred: brief basis)_
- Never present unsourced inference as bare assertion
- Never use "intuition" — use "pattern-match," "aggregate likelihood," or "low-confidence extrapolation"
- If you cannot verify a URL resolves, note _(link unverified)_
- If web search returns nothing useful for a claim, flag it explicitly — do NOT silently fall back to training data

OUTPUT: Structured facts, 400-600 words. End with: (a) sources used, (b) citation count: "X sourced, Y unsourced, Z inferred"
```

**Pass 2 — Perspective shaping (sonnet, parallel, one per facet):**

Each agent receives the Pass 1 output plus the occupation and staleness context. It does NOT re-research — it reshapes existing facts for the reader.

```
You are a perspective-shaping agent. Your task:

PASS 1 RESEARCH (use as your primary source — do not re-research):
{pass_1_output}

READER OCCUPATION: {occ_value}
{If --time is set:}
KNOWLEDGE STALENESS: The reader's last deep technical engagement was {time} years ago.
Bridge from tools/patterns current in {current_year - time}. Explicitly flag what
has changed since then. Do not assume familiarity with anything that emerged in the
last {time} years.

Reshape the research for this reader:
- Map concepts to equivalents they already know from their occupation
- Add analogies, comparisons, and "in your world, this is like..." framing
- Calibrate risk warnings to their operational context
- Flag misconceptions their background likely creates
- Preserve all citations from Pass 1 exactly as written

OUTPUT: 600-800 words of shaped prose. Preserve all citation markers. Do not fabricate new factual claims beyond what Pass 1 provided.
```

### Step 3: Validate and synthesize

**Step 3a: Validate subagent output** (before any synthesis):

- If a subagent returned empty, errored, or off-topic: re-research that facet yourself
- If a subagent returned fewer than 200 words or zero sourced citations: flag as low-confidence and supplement with your own research
- Check self-reported citation counts — if a facet is mostly unsourced/inferred, note this for the confidence assessment

**Step 3b: Citation audit:**

Scan all facet outputs for bare assertions (factual claims with no `([source](url))`, `_(unsourced)_`, or `_(~inferred:...)_` marker). Either source them, mark them, or reframe as inference before proceeding.

**Step 3c: Synthesize:**

1. **Check for contradictions** — Do any two facets make conflicting claims? Surface explicitly with `_(~inferred: sources conflict — see [section A] vs [section B])_`
2. **Deduplicate** — Merge thematically overlapping content under one authoritative section. Restructure so each concept appears once in the most logical location.
3. **Bridge gaps** — Add cross-references between sections where one explains something another assumes. Use Obsidian wikilinks (`[[Section Name]]`) for `--fmt obsidian`; use standard markdown links (`[Section Name](#section-name)`) for `--fmt notebook` (wikilinks don't render in Jupyter).
4. **Restore perspective** — If the `--occ` framing got lost in raw research, restore it. Every section needs at least one element specifically shaped for the reader's occupation.
5. **Shape the narrative** — Map synthesized content to the report template sections. The output of this step is a complete draft, not a content blob.

### Step 4: Format and output

**Format selection:** If `--fmt notebook` is active, delegate to `notebook-format.md` for notebook generation. The synthesized draft from Step 3 is passed as input. Skip the remainder of this section (Obsidian-specific formatting). Step 5 verification still runs on the synthesized draft (before format conversion).

**If `--fmt obsidian` or omitted (default):**

**Before drafting:** Invoke `obsidian:obsidian-markdown` via the Skill tool to load Obsidian formatting conventions.

**Output destination:** Ask the user where to save the report (vault path, project directory, or output inline to chat). If the user has no preference, output inline.

Produce the final report as **Obsidian-flavored markdown**:

- YAML frontmatter with properties: `topic`, `perspective`, `date`, `staleness` (if `--time` set), `plugins` (list of active plugins), `confidence` (high/medium/low based on citation density), `source_count`, `tags`
- Use `> [!info]`, `> [!tip]`, `> [!warning]` callouts for key takeaways
- Tags belong in the **frontmatter `tags:` list** only — do NOT add a blockquote tag line at end of document
- Sanitize tags: no spaces (use hyphens), cannot start with a number, lowercase

**Visualization decision:**

| Situation | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Sequential flows, architecture, process steps | Mermaid `flowchart` or `sequenceDiagram` in a fenced code block |
| Entity relationships, class hierarchies | Mermaid `classDiagram` or `erDiagram` in a fenced code block |
| 5+ entities with many cross-cutting relationships | Canvas file via `obsidian:json-canvas` — ask user first, requires Obsidian open |
| Obsidian may not be running | Mermaid only |

**Report template:**

```markdown
---
topic: "{tgt_value}"
perspective: "{occ_value}"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
staleness: {time_value or omit if not set}
plugins:
  - {active plugins or omit if none}

Note: The `date` field must be substituted with the actual current date in ISO 8601 format (e.g., `2026-04-03`), not a placeholder string.

### Step 5: Verification (separate phase, haiku agent)

Do NOT embed verification into Step 4. Dispatch a **haiku** agent after the report is drafted to verify independently:

```
You are a verification agent. Check the following report for structural and citation integrity.

REPORT:
{draft_report}

Check:
1. FRONTMATTER: All required fields present (topic, perspective, date, confidence, source_count, tags). Date is ISO 8601 (not a placeholder). Tags are lowercase, hyphenated, no leading numbers. source_count matches actual count.
2. SECTIONS: All template sections present (TL;DR, Why This Matters, What This Is NOT, Core Concepts, Quick Reference, Gotchas, Further Reading).
3. CITATIONS: Scan every factual sentence. Flag any bare assertions (no URL, no _(unsourced)_, no _(~inferred:...)_ marker). List line numbers.
4. LINKS: If any wikilinks ([[...]]) are used, verify they reference sections that exist in this document.
5. CONFIDENCE: Count sourced vs unsourced vs inferred claims. Report: "X sourced, Y unsourced, Z inferred → confidence: high|medium|low"

Confidence thresholds:
- high: >70% sourced claims
- medium: 40-70% sourced claims
- low: <40% sourced claims

Report: PASS (all checks green) or FAIL with specific issues listed.
```

If verification returns FAIL, fix the specific issues before delivering to the user. Do not re-run the full pipeline — patch the draft directly.

## Plugin Registry

Plugins are registered in YAML files mapping friendly names to MCP tool workflows.

**File locations (resolution order):**

| File | Scope | Writable by user |
|------|-------|------------------|
| `<project>/.ketchup-plugins.yaml` | Project-level overrides | Yes |
| `~/.ketchup-plugins.yaml` | User-owned global additions | Yes (`--registry add --global` writes here) |
| `<plugin-install>/skills/ketchup/plugin-registry.yaml` | Ships with plugin (read-only defaults) | No — overwritten on plugin update |

After marketplace install, the shipped registry lands at `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/ketchup/<version>/skills/ketchup/plugin-registry.yaml`. Do not edit this file directly — it is overwritten on plugin updates. Use `--registry add --global` to write to `~/.ketchup-plugins.yaml` instead.

**Match field semantics:** The `match` field uses **substring matching** against the normalized plugin name. `"microsoft"` matches input `"microsoft-docs"`, `"microsoft"`, etc. Matching is case-insensitive after normalization.

**Hint-based tool resolution:** Workflow entries use a `hint` field (a short substring like `"query-docs"`) instead of full tool names. At runtime, the hint is matched against the actual MCP tools discovered in the session. This makes registry entries portable across environments — the same hint works whether the tool is named `mcp__plugin_context7_context7__query-docs` (Claude Code) or `context7_query-docs` (claude.ai) or any other platform-specific prefix.

**Format:**

```yaml
plugins:
  context7:
    match: "context7"
    description: "Current documentation for libraries, frameworks, and SDKs"
    workflow:
      - hint: "resolve-library-id"
        action: "Resolve topic to library ID"
      - hint: "query-docs"
        action: "Query per-facet with focused strings"
```

**`--registry` subcommands:**

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `--registry list` | Show all registered plugins (project + user + shipped) with source file |
| `--registry add <name>` | Prompt for match pattern, description, and workflow steps (hint + action pairs). Write to project-level `.ketchup-plugins.yaml` by default; `--global` writes to `~/.ketchup-plugins.yaml` |
| `--registry remove <name>` | Remove from project-level file (or `--global` for `~/.ketchup-plugins.yaml`) |

When `--registry add` prompts for workflow steps, list the available MCP tools from the current session to help the user identify the right hints. Extract the unique suffix from each tool name (e.g., `mcp__plugin_context7_context7__query-docs` → hint `"query-docs"`). If no MCP tools are available, the user can manually enter hint strings (they can find these later when MCP servers are configured).

## Cite-and-Tag (Always Active)

All ketchup outputs follow cite-and-tag rules defined in `cite-and-tag.md` in this skill's directory. The orchestrating agent has access to this file directly. Subagents receive the rules inline in their prompt template (Step 2).

`cite-and-tag.md` is the single source of truth. If updating citation behavior, update that file first, then sync the subagent prompt template in Step 2.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---|---|
| Writing for experts when `--occ` implies beginner in that area | Re-read `--occ` — bridge from what they KNOW |
| Generic report with no occupation shaping | Every section needs at least one element specific to `--occ` |
| Skipping citations on "obvious" facts | Nothing is obvious cross-domain. Cite it or flag it. |
| Monolithic single-agent research | Use parallel subagents — breadth AND depth |
| Raw subagent output without synthesis | Always validate, deduplicate, and bridge across facets |
| Instructing subagents to use MCP tools | Subagents can't access MCP. Pre-fetch in Step 1.5 instead. |
| Using full tool names in registry `hint` fields | Hints are substrings (e.g., `"query-docs"`), not full names. Full names break cross-platform. |
| Ignoring subagent failures | Validate output before synthesis. Re-research empty/weak facets. |
| Tags outside YAML frontmatter | Use frontmatter `tags:` list — Obsidian's canonical, indexable tag location |
| Passing full `--tgt` as plugin query | Use per-facet focused query strings for better results |
| Forcing 6 facets on a narrow topic | Narrow topics get 1-2 deep facets. Don't pad. |
| Running plugins without `--plugin` or config | Plugins are strictly opt-in. No prefetch without explicit request. |
| Ignoring `--time` in subagent prompts | Always include staleness context when set. It shapes everything. |
| Using sonnet/opus for fact extraction | Pass 1 is mechanical — use haiku. Reserve sonnet for perspective shaping. |
| Skipping the dispatch table | Check the table before every `Agent()` call. Don't ad-hoc model selection. |
| Doing verification inline during synthesis | Verification is a separate phase (Step 5) with its own haiku agent. |
| "I'll use opus to be safe" | Opus costs 10-15x more. Only escalate per the dispatch table conditions. |
| Re-researching in Pass 2 | Pass 2 reshapes Pass 1 output. It does NOT re-read sources or do web search. |
| Using `--kernel` without `--fmt notebook` | `--kernel` only applies to notebook output. Reject with message. |
| Combining `--annotate` with `--tgt` or `--occ` | `--annotate` is standalone. It inherits perspective from notebook metadata. |
| Generating notebook with Obsidian callout syntax | Use HTML alert divs — Obsidian callouts don't render in Jupyter. See `notebook-format.md`. |
| Wikilinks in notebook output | Wikilinks render as literal `[[text]]` in Jupyter. Use standard markdown links. |
| Re-specifying `--occ` with `--annotate` | Not needed — perspective lives in the notebook's `metadata.ketchup`. |

## Examples

**Set perspective only:**
```
/ketchup --occ "Full-Stack JavaScript Developer"
```
→ "Session perspective set to Full-Stack JavaScript Developer. All ketchup reports will bridge concepts to JS/web development patterns. Use `--tgt` to generate a report."

**Full invocation with plugins and staleness:**
```
/ketchup --occ "Windows Systems Engineer" --tgt "SELinux Administration" --plugin "Context7" --time 6
```
→ Pre-fetches SELinux docs via Context7, decomposes into facets, dispatches research agents (each aware the reader's last deep engagement was 2020-era Windows), synthesizes into an Obsidian report bridging SELinux through Windows security concepts.

**Using config defaults:**
```
# With ~/.ketchup containing occ, plugins, time:
