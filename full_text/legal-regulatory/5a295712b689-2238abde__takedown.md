# /takedown

Three modes. Pick one:

- `/ip-legal:takedown --send` — draft a notificação de retirada de conteúdo under Marco Civil (Lei 12.965/2014 art. 19/21) + Lei 9.610/1998. Limitations/exceptions gate + loud litigation-risk gate before delivery.
- `/ip-legal:takedown --respond` — triage a notice someone sent you. Options: comply / contest / engage / ignore.
- `/ip-legal:takedown --counter` — draft a resposta/contranotificação to a platform or notifier. Loud gate for the litigation-exposure admission and the good-faith statement.

## Instructions

1. **Read the practice profile.** Load `~/.claude/plugins/config/claude-for-legal/ip-legal/CLAUDE.md`. If it contains `[PLACEHOLDER]` markers or does not exist, stop and say: "This plugin needs setup before it can give you useful output. Run `/ip-legal:cold-start-interview` — the takedown skill depends on your approval matrix and practice profile."

2. **Check matter workspaces.** Per `## Matter workspaces`: if `Enabled` is `✗`, skip. If enabled and there is no active matter, ask: "Which matter is this for? Run `/ip-legal:matter-workspace switch <slug>` or say `practice-level`."

3. **Dispatch on `$ARGUMENTS`:**
   - `--send` → run send mode (below). Walk identify-the-work, identify-the-infringing-material, limitations/exceptions gate (Lei 9.610/1998 art. 46-48), good-faith belief, accuracy/authority, choose the channel (ToS notice vs. notificação extrajudicial vs. tutela de urgência), draft the notice, run the loud gate, write output.
   - `--respond` → run respond mode (below). Read the incoming notice, assess (license, limitations/exceptions, defects, whether art. 19 requires a court order at all, notifier credibility), present the four options, recommend, write the triage memo.
   - `--counter` → run counter mode (below). Confirm the predicate (content removed via ToS/platform notice, good-faith belief the removal was mistaken/misidentified, ready for the litigation exposure, attorney in the loop), draft the resposta/contranotificação, run the loud gate, write output.
   - No flag → ask once: "Are we sending a notificação de retirada, triaging one we received, or drafting a response/contranotificação?"

4. **Respect the gates.** In `--send` and `--counter`, the loud gate runs before any final output is written. The limitations/exceptions gate in `--send` is separate and runs earlier; "debatable" or "likely covered by a limitation (art. 46-48)" stops the draft and routes to attorney review.

5. **Jurisdiction note.** The Marco Civil regime (Lei 12.965/2014 art. 19/21) governs content hosted by providers reachable under Brazilian jurisdiction. Under **art. 19**, the general rule is that a provider is only civilly liable for third-party content after failing to comply with a **specific court order** — an extrajudicial notice does not, by itself, compel removal. Under **art. 21**, non-consensual nudity or private sexual acts are the express exception: notification by the victim (or legal representative) is enough to trigger provider liability. If the provider sits under **US jurisdiction only** (US-hosted, no Brazilian presence), the DMCA path in the gated fallback section may be the effective instrument instead of — or alongside — the Brazilian route. [verified: https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2011-2014/2014/lei/l12965.htm]

6. **Hand off where appropriate.** `--respond` with a contest recommendation chains into `/ip-legal:takedown --counter` — but only after the triage memo has been reviewed and the decision to contest has been made deliberately.

## Examples

```
/ip-legal:takedown --send
/ip-legal:takedown --respond ~/Downloads/youtube-notificacao.pdf
/ip-legal:takedown --counter
/ip-legal:takedown
```

## Notes

- The outgoing notice and response do not carry the confidentiality header. Internal drafts, limitations analyses, and triage memos do.
- Marco Civil art. 19 sets a court-order-first rule; art. 21 is the narrow exception. Getting the channel wrong (extrajudicial where a court order is needed, or vice versa) wastes leverage.
- A notificação extrajudicial preserves evidence and starts the clock, but under art. 19 it generally does not compel a provider to remove ordinary content — a tutela de urgência (CPC art. 300) usually does. This is not a formality.
- Non-lawyer users get a one-page brief for the attorney conversation before the gate clears — particularly important where a tutela de urgência or an abuse-of-notification exposure is in play.

---

## Purpose

The Brazilian notice-and-action system under the Marco Civil da Internet (Lei 12.965/2014) is deliberately court-order-centric, and consequential when misused. A notificação extrajudicial is a formal assertion of a right that preserves evidence and starts a record; under art. 19 it generally does not, by itself, compel a provider to remove ordinary content — that ordinarily requires a specific court order (often via tutela de urgência, CPC art. 300). Art. 21 is the express exception: for non-consensual nudity or private sexual acts, a victim's notification is enough. A response/contranotificação puts contested content back in play and can precipitate litigation. This skill handles all three moves with the guardrails each warrants.

Three modes:

- `--send` — draft a notificação de retirada de conteúdo (ToS notice / notificação extrajudicial / tutela de urgência as appropriate)
- `--respond` — triage a notice someone sent you; produce options
- `--counter` — draft a resposta/contranotificação

If the user does not pass a flag, ask once: "Are we sending a notificação de retirada, triaging one we received, or drafting a response/contranotificação?"

> **External deliverables (send and counter modes):** the outgoing notice/response goes to the provider (via ToS channel) or to the counterparty (notificação extrajudicial). Do NOT include the `CONFIDENCIAL — SIGILO PROFISSIONAL` header on the outgoing document — a notice sent to a third party is not a sigiloso communication and marking it as such creates a discardable admission. Internal drafts, pre-send briefs, limitations analyses, and triage memos keep the header per plugin config `## Outputs`.

## Jurisdiction assumption

The Marco Civil da Internet (**Lei 12.965/2014**) governs provider liability for third-party content in Brazil. The two load-bearing articles: [verified: https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2011-2014/2014/lei/l12965.htm]

- **Art. 19 — general rule.** A connection/application provider is civilly liable for third-party content only if, **after a specific court order** identifying the content, it fails to make it unavailable. An extrajudicial notice does not trigger liability for ordinary content; a court order (typically a tutela de urgência, CPC art. 300) is the instrument that compels removal. `[settled — last confirmed 2026-07-02]`
- **Art. 21 — exception.** For content containing **nudity or private sexual acts** disclosed without the participant's consent, the provider is subsidiarily liable if, **after notification by the participant or their legal representative**, it does not act diligently to remove it. Here a notification — not a court order — is the trigger. `[settled — last confirmed 2026-07-02]`

Copyright subsistence and moral/patrimonial rights are governed by **Lei 9.610/1998**. Platform ToS channels frequently offer a faster practical route than either the notice or the court order. If the provider sits under **US jurisdiction only** (US-hosted, no Brazilian presence and no submission to Brazilian courts), the DMCA path in the gated fallback below may be the effective instrument. Copyright subsistence is Berne-multilateral; enforcement mechanics are jurisdiction-specific.

## Load context

- `~/.claude/plugins/config/claude-for-legal/ip-legal/CLAUDE.md` → `## Perfil de prática (PI)` (direito autoral ownership if any), `## Postura de enforcement` → `Notificação de retirada de conteúdo (ordinária)` row, `## Outputs` (confidentiality header, role), `## Who's using this` (role — lawyer vs. non-lawyer)
- **Matter context.** Check `## Matter workspaces` in the practice-level CLAUDE.md. If `Enabled` is `✗` (in-house default), skip matter machinery. If enabled and no active matter, ask: "Which matter? Run `/ip-legal:matter-workspace switch <slug>` or say `practice-level`." Write outputs to the active matter's folder at `~/.claude/plugins/config/claude-for-legal/ip-legal/matters/<matter-slug>/takedown/<slug>/` (or `takedown/<slug>/` at practice level). Never read another matter's files unless `Cross-matter context` is `on`.

## Send mode — drafting a notificação de retirada de conteúdo

### Step 1: Identify the copyrighted work

> What is the copyrighted work?
>
> - **Title / description** — what is the work (software, image, text, video, audio)?
> - **Ownership / titularidade** — do you hold the patrimonial rights outright, or an exclusive license with authority to act? Copyright arises on creation under Lei 9.610/1998 — no registration is required to hold the right or to notify. Optional registration (e.g., Biblioteca Nacional, INPI for software) is evidentiary, not constitutive. `[settled — last confirmed 2026-07-02]`
> - **Prior licensing** — have you ever licensed this use, or a broader use that might cover it?

Ownership and authority are the first things an abuse-of-notification / bad-faith challenge looks at. Get them clearly on the record before drafting.

### Step 2: Identify the infringing material and its location

> Where is the infringing material?
>
> - **Platform / provider** — YouTube, X, Instagram, GitHub, Mercado Livre, a web host, etc.
> - **URL(s)** — specific permalinks to the infringing material. One notice can cover multiple URLs if they're all on the same service.
> - **Description** — what is the infringing material and how does it infringe (verbatim copy, substantially similar, unauthorized derivative)?
> - **Screenshots / evidence** — preserved with timestamp and URL visible; an ata notarial can harden this for later court use

Under Marco Civil art. 19 § 1º, a court order must identify the content **clara e especificamente** (clear and specific location) to be enforceable. A notice or petition that cannot locate the material precisely fails at the court-order stage. Be precise.

### Step 3: Limitations and exceptions gate

Before asserting the right, walk the limitations of Lei 9.610/1998 (arts. 46-48) — the Brazilian analog to fair use, though it is a **closed list of enumerated exceptions**, not an open standard. Sending a notice against a use that falls inside a statutory limitation is the abuse-of-right exposure (Código Civil art. 187).

Ask:

> Before we draft, walk the limitations of Lei 9.610/1998 art. 46-48 — even if the conclusion is "not covered." Consider in particular:
>
> 1. **Art. 46** — reproduction for criticism/comment, news reporting, quotation (citação) within limits, private single-copy for the copier's own use, use in classrooms, accessibility copies, and similar enumerated uses.
> 2. **Art. 47** — paraphrases and parodies that are not true reproductions and do not discredit the work.
> 3. **Art. 48** — works permanently in public places.
> 4. **Purpose and market effect** — does the use compete with or substitute for the original? (Not a statutory factor as in the US, but relevant to whether a court will treat it as abusive infringement.)
>
> Your read on each? And your conclusion — outside any limitation, debatable, likely covered?

Record the answer in the notice file. If "debatable" or "likely covered," do not draft. Stop and route to attorney review: "This use may fall within a Lei 9.610/1998 limitation. Notifying against a lawful use is abuse of right (CC art. 187) and can invert the exposure onto us. Route this to counsel before any notice goes out." `[review]`

### Step 4: Good-faith belief

The notifier asserts, in good faith, that the use is unauthorized and unlawful. A false or reckless assertion supports an abuse-of-notification / abuso de direito claim (CC art. 187) and possible danos morais. [verified: https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/2002/l10406compilada.htm]

The sender forms this belief on the record. Have they:

- Confirmed the work is theirs (or they hold an exclusive license with authority to act)?
- Confirmed the use is not licensed (no prior deal, no implied license, no Creative Commons or open grant that would cover it)?
- Considered the art. 46-48 limitations (Step 3)?
- Reviewed the accused content directly (not just a report about it)?

If yes on all four, the good-faith belief is colorable. If no on any, pause.

### Step 5: Accuracy and authority

The notice (and any petition for a tutela de urgência) rests on the accuracy of the identification and the notifier's authority to act on behalf of the rights holder. Misstatements expose the notifier to abuse-of-right and litigation-cost consequences; a petition also carries the litigant's duty of good faith (CPC art. 5º) and can attract litigância de má-fé (CPC art. 80) if abusive.

Confirm signer: who is sending this on behalf of whom, and do they have authority (procuração where a lawyer signs) to do so?

### Step 6: Draft the notice

Choose the channel first, then draft. The three channels, in rising order of force:

- **ToS / platform channel** — the provider's own copyright/abuse form. Fastest practical route; the provider acts under its own policy, not under a legal compulsion. Good first move for straightforward infringement.
- **Notificação extrajudicial** — a formal notice to the counterparty (and/or provider). Preserves evidence, starts a record, constitutes the party in mora. Under art. 19 it generally does **not** compel a provider to remove ordinary content, but it is the predicate step and can resolve matters without court. For art. 21 content (non-consensual intimate imagery), the notification itself triggers provider liability.
- **Tutela de urgência (CPC art. 300)** — a petition for an urgent judicial order. This is the instrument that produces the art. 19 court order compelling removal of ordinary content. Requires probabilidade do direito + perigo de dano. Drafted with counsel; filed by an advogado.

Elements common to the notificação extrajudicial — each must be present:

1. **Signature** of the rights holder or authorized representative (advogado with procuração where applicable)
2. **Identification of the copyrighted work** — "Obra: [title, description, any registration]"
3. **Identification of the infringing material** with clear and specific location — "Conteúdo infrator: [URL(s), description, how it infringes]"
4. **Contact / qualificação** — full identification and address of the notifier or representative
5. **Statement of the right and its violation** — the patrimonial/moral right under Lei 9.610/1998 and how the use violates it
6. **Demand and deadline** — the specific act requested (removal, cessation) and a reasonable prazo, with notice that non-compliance will lead to a tutela de urgência (CPC art. 300) and indemnification claims (Lei 9.610/1998 arts. 102-107)

Structure:

- Notifier qualificação block / date
- Recipient: the counterparty and/or the provider's designated legal/abuse contact
- Assunto: Notificação extrajudicial — violação de direito autoral (Lei 9.610/1998; Marco Civil, Lei 12.965/2014)
- The six elements above, numbered or clearly set apart
- Signature line

Most providers publish a preferred abuse/copyright form or web intake. The skill produces the notice content; the user submits through the provider's path or serves the extrajudicial notice. Note in the output which channel is expected and whether art. 21 changes the analysis.

> **Gated fallback — US-jurisdiction providers.** If the provider is US-hosted with no Brazilian presence and does not submit to Brazilian courts, the Brazilian notice may reach no one with power to act. In that case the **DMCA §512(c)(3)** notice-and-takedown path may be the effective instrument. The DMCA notice is a sworn statement under penalty of perjury and carries §512(f) exposure for material misrepresentations (*Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.*, 801 F.3d 1126 (9th Cir. 2015) `[settled — last confirmed 2026-07-02]`). Its elements: signature; identification of the work; identification and location of the infringing material; contact info; good-faith-belief statement; and an accuracy-and-authority statement under penalty of perjury. Recipient is the provider's designated agent (Copyright Office DMCA Designated Agent Directory, `https://www.copyright.gov/dmca-directory/`). Use this ONLY when the Brazilian route cannot reach the provider — it is a US-footprint fallback, not the default. `[review]`

### Step 7: The loud gate before delivery

If the user is a non-lawyer (per `## Who's using this`), add:

> A notificação de retirada is a formal assertion of a right and creates abuse-of-right exposure (Código Civil art. 187) for bad-faith or overbroad use — and compelling removal of ordinary content requires a court order (tutela de urgência, CPC art. 300), not a letter. Have you reviewed this with an advogado inscrito na OAB? If not, here's a brief to bring to them: [generate a short summary: work, ownership, accused use, licensing check, art. 46-48 limitations analysis, channel chosen, signer, provider]. A few thousand reais of attorney time now is materially cheaper than an abuse-of-right suit.
>
> If you need to find an advogado inscrito na OAB: your local OAB seccional's serviço de referência/indicação, the OAB's comissões de propriedade intelectual, or núcleos de prática jurídica / clínicas de PI at law schools for individual creators and small businesses.

Do not write the final output without explicit engagement with the gate.

### Step 8: Output

**Primary:** `<matter-folder>/takedown/<slug>/notice-v<N>.md` (or .docx). The notice content, ready to serve as a notificação extrajudicial, paste into the provider's abuse/copyright intake, or hand to counsel as the predicate for a tutela de urgência petition.

**In-chat:** show the notice as plain text for review before writing. Iterate before committing to disk.

**Reviewer-facing closing note** (in the in-chat preview only):

> This is a draft notice for attorney review, not a notice ready to serve. Sending it is a formal assertion of a right with abuse-of-right exposure (CC art. 187), and compelling removal of ordinary content requires a court order (tutela de urgência, CPC art. 300). An advogado inscrito na OAB reviews, edits, and takes professional responsibility before service. Do not send this unreviewed.

**Citation verification.** Any case or statutory citation included (for example, in internal memoranda around the notice) must be verified on a legal research tool. Source-tag each — `[JusBrasil]`, `[Escavador]`, `[PJe]`, `[user provided]`, `[model knowledge — verify]`, `[web search — verify]`. Citations tagged `verify` get checked first. No silent supplement from web or model knowledge if a configured research tool comes up thin — present options to the user.

**Post-send record.** After service/submission, write `<matter-folder>/takedown/<slug>/submission.md`: provider or counterparty, channel used (ToS form URL, AR do correio / cartório de títulos e documentos, or protocolo judicial), date sent, confirmation/protocolo if returned, URLs targeted, prazo given for compliance, next-step date to escalate to tutela de urgência if ignored, legal hold refreshed.

## Respond mode — triaging a notice you received

Your content was taken down, or you received a notificação extrajudicial demanding removal. You have options — and under Marco Civil art. 19, an extrajudicial demand generally does not compel anything absent a court order.

### Step 1: Read the notice you received

Extract:

- **Sender** — entity, signer, advogado (and procuração?), address, email
- **Provider** — who acted or notified you (the platform), if any
- **Claimed work** — what they say is theirs
- **Your content alleged to infringe** — URL(s) or identifiers as they named them
- **Date of removal / notice**
- **Channel and legal basis** — is this a bare extrajudicial notice (art. 19: no obligation to remove absent a court order), an art. 21 notification, or an actual court order (mandado/decisão)? This is the pivotal question.

### Step 2: Assess

- **Do we have a license?** Negotiated, implied, Creative Commons, prior settlement, cessão — anything that authorizes the use.
- **Is it covered by a limitation?** Walk Lei 9.610/1998 art. 46-48 (criticism, quotation, parody, public-place works, private copy). Be honest; this is for us, not the response.
- **Is there actually a binding order?** Under art. 19, only a specific court order compels removal of ordinary content. If the sender sent a mere extrajudicial notice, the provider had no obligation to act and neither do you — leverage is on your side. If it is an art. 21 case (non-consensual intimate imagery), notification alone is enough and the analysis flips.
- **Is the notice/petition defective or abusive?** Vague content identification (fails art. 19 § 1º specificity), no rights ownership shown, or plainly against a lawful use — that raises the sender's abuse-of-right (CC art. 187) exposure and our leverage.
- **Is the sender a troll?** Repeat pattern of overbroad extrajudicial notices?

### Step 3: Options

Present 4 options with tradeoffs:

**A — Comply (let the removal stand)**
- When: they're right, it's an art. 21 case, or the fight isn't worth it
- Tradeoff: content stays down; may affect reach, monetized accounts, livelihood for creators
- Next step: log the event, confirm no deadline issues, move on

**B — Contest (resposta/contranotificação; restore request)**
- When: we have a good-faith belief the removal was mistaken or misidentified — often where the use is licensed, covered by an art. 46-48 limitation, or the sender doesn't own the work; and there is no binding court order
- Tradeoff: signals we will defend; if the sender then seeks a tutela de urgência (CPC art. 300), the dispute moves to court and content may stay down pending decision
- Next step: `/ip-legal:takedown --counter`

**C — Engage the sender directly**
- When: there's room for a business resolution (license, credit, removal of a narrower portion)
- Tradeoff: content status holds during the conversation; keep settlement-communication hygiene (tratativas/proposta de acordo are generally protected from being used as admission)
- Next step: outreach letter to the sender; do not send the contranotificação while discussions are live

**D — Ignore and let it stand; raise it elsewhere**
- When: the harm is small, there is no court order, and we'd rather deal with the sender separately
- Tradeoff: content status holds; if the notice itself was bad-faith, we may have an abuse-of-right (CC art. 187) / danos morais claim to assert on our own schedule — but that's its own fight

Recommend one with two sentences of rationale.

### Step 4: Write triage memo

Output: `<matter-folder>/takedown/inbound/<slug>/triage.md`.

```markdown
[CONFIDENTIALITY HEADER — per plugin config ## Outputs]

Close the in-chat presentation with:

> This is a triage memo, not advice. The assessments above are a first read from the four corners of the notice. An advogado evaluates before you contest, engage, or decide not to respond — especially the art. 19-vs-art. 21 call, which changes whether the sender can compel anything.

## Counter mode — drafting a resposta/contranotificação

A resposta/contranotificação contests the removal and asks the provider to restore, or answers the notifier's demand. It signals you will defend — and can precipitate the notifier's move to a tutela de urgência (CPC art. 300). It is the step before litigation.

### Step 1: Confirm the predicate

- The content was removed via a provider/ToS action or a bare extrajudicial notice — **not** an already-binding court order (if there is a court order, the path is judicial defense, not a contranotificação).
- You have a good-faith belief the removal was a mistake or misidentification — because the use is licensed, covered by a Lei 9.610/1998 limitation (art. 46-48), not actually infringing, or the notifier doesn't own the work.
- You are prepared for the notifier to escalate to a tutela de urgência in the competent Brazilian court (and, if the facts are cross-border, for a jurisdiction fight).
- The decision has been made deliberately — not in reaction, not without attorney input.

### Step 2: Draft the resposta/contranotificação

Elements — each must be present:

1. **Signature** of the subscriber or authorized representative (advogado with procuração where applicable)
2. **Identification of the material removed** and its location before removal (the URL where the content was)
3. **Statement of good-faith belief that the removal was mistaken or a misidentification** — with the concrete basis (license, art. 46-48 limitation, non-ownership by the notifier)
4. **Subscriber qualificação** — name, address, contact — and a request that the provider restore the content or, at minimum, provide the notifier's identification so the dispute can proceed; note willingness to submit the matter to the competent Brazilian court if the notifier persists

Structure:

- Subscriber qualificação block / date
- Recipient: the provider's legal/abuse contact (and/or the original notifier)
- Assunto: Resposta a notificação / pedido de restabelecimento de conteúdo (Marco Civil, Lei 12.965/2014; Lei 9.610/1998)
- The four elements above, numbered or clearly set apart
- Signature line

### Step 3: The loud gate before delivery

If the user is a non-lawyer:

> A resposta/contranotificação can precipitate litigation and carries its own abuse-of-right exposure (CC art. 187). Have you reviewed with an advogado inscrito na OAB? This is not the Claude-review layer; this is the step where you need licensed professional judgment. Brief for the conversation: [generate a 1-page summary]. Referral resources: your local OAB seccional's serviço de indicação; the OAB's comissões de propriedade intelectual; núcleos de prática jurídica / clínicas de PI at law schools.

Do not write the final output without explicit engagement.

### Step 4: Output

**Primary:** `<matter-folder>/takedown/<slug>/counter-notice-v<N>.md` — the response content, ready to submit via the provider's channel or serve on the notifier.

**In-chat:** present as plain text for review before committing.

**Reviewer-facing closing note** (in-chat only):

> This is a draft response for attorney review, not a response ready to send. Sending it signals you will defend and can precipitate a tutela de urgência (CPC art. 300). An advogado inscrito na OAB reviews before submission. Do not send this unreviewed.

**Post-submission record.** After submission, write `<matter-folder>/takedown/<slug>/counter-submission.md`: provider, date sent, confirmation/protocolo, whether restoration was granted, watch for the notifier seeking a tutela de urgência, plan if content is restored, plan if the notifier files suit.

## Decision posture

Per `## Decision posture on subjective legal calls` in the practice profile: when uncertain whether a use falls within a Lei 9.610/1998 limitation, whether the rights holder is us, whether the work is actually ours, whether art. 19 (court order needed) or art. 21 (notification enough) governs, whether a limitation defeats the claim on the receiving side — do not silently decide. The art. 46-48 limitations call and the art. 19-vs-21 call are the paradigmatic uncertain ones. Flag for attorney review; surface the factors. Sending a notice or a response on an assumption is a one-way door.

## What this skill does not do

- **Serve the notice or file the petition.** Drafting only. The user serves the extrajudicial notice, submits via the provider's channel, or hands the draft to counsel for a tutela de urgência.
- **Pick a provider's intake form for the user.** Notes which channel is expected; does not auto-submit.
- **Decide the limitations question.** Walks Lei 9.610/1998 art. 46-48; flags. An attorney decides whether to proceed.
- **Validate the sender's claim on the receive side.** Structured read; every authority flagged for SME verification.
- **Bypass the gate.** The gate runs every time in `--send` and `--counter` modes.
- **Invent citations.** Any cites included are source-tagged and flagged for verification; no silent supplement.
- **Handle US-only providers as the default.** The DMCA path is a gated fallback for US-hosted providers with no Brazilian reach — flag and route to it only when the Brazilian route cannot reach the provider.
