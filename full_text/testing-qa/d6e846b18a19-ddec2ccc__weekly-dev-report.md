# Weekly Activity Report

Generate a weekly activity report for every team member with tickets in the active Jira sprint. The roster typically mixes engineers, QA, content/media folks, and consultants — keep all member-facing language generic ("team member", "member", "contributor") so the report does not mislabel anyone as an engineer. The report includes a **sprint-goal delivery-risk assessment with a concrete catch-up plan**, per-member sprint achievability (🟢🟡🔴) that is **role-aware** (each member's role is confirmed once and cached), ticket and PR activity, time-logged audit, and flags for stuck tickets and stalled members. Writes `WEEKLY_REPORT.md` to the current directory, prints to stdout, and on `--send` delivers via Gmail.

## Arguments

Parse arguments from the user's invocation:

- `--dry-run` (default) — write `WEEKLY_REPORT.md` and print to stdout. Do not send email.
- `--send` — after generating, email the report. Primary recipient comes from env var `WEEKLY_DEV_REPORT_TO` (required when `--send` is used); additional recipients from env var `WEEKLY_DEV_REPORT_CC` (comma-separated, may be empty/unset). If `WEEKLY_DEV_REPORT_TO` is unset, abort with a message asking the user to set it.
- `--week-offset N` — run the report for N weeks ago (0 = this week, 1 = last week, default 0).
- `--window <past|current>` — choose the weekly window. `past` (default) = the **previous completed** Mon→Sun (a fixed 7-day week; stable for scheduled emails). `current` = **week-to-date**: this week's Monday through today (a partial week, fewer than 7 days unless run on Sunday) so the report can be run any day. When omitted in an interactive preview, the skill asks (Step 1). A `--send` / non-interactive run defaults to `past`.
- `--sprint <ID|name>` — override sprint detection (rare; usually the active sprint is correct).
- `--reconfirm-roles` — force the interactive role prompt for **every** roster member, ignoring the cache (Step 2.5). Use after team changes. Without it, only members missing from the role cache are prompted.

If the user did not pass `--send`, treat the run as a preview. Never send email unless `--send` is present. Role prompting (Step 2.5) only happens in a preview/interactive run — a `--send` run never prompts and instead falls back to the cached roles plus auto-detected defaults.

## Run from the target repo's directory (direnv)

The CLI / `curl` fallbacks below authenticate with credentials that [direnv](https://direnv.net/) loads from the `.envrc` of the **current working directory**: `GITHUB_TOKEN` for `gh`, and `JIRA_URL`/`JIRA_EMAIL`/`JIRA_API_TOKEN` for `jira`/`curl`. Run one of these from a directory whose `.envrc` belongs to a **different** repo/account and it authenticates as the wrong account — the call fails or silently returns nothing, and the report is built on missing data.

**Before any command that needs these credentials (`gh`, `gh api`, `jira`, `curl` against Jira), make a checkout in the target org the working directory in its own step:**

```bash
cd /path/to/target-repo        # or, when already inside it: cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
```

Run the `cd` as a **separate** Bash call — never chain it as `cd … && gh …`. direnv reloads `.envrc` on the next prompt, so the *following* calls get the right token; a command on the same line as the `cd` still runs with the old environment. This report queries many repos at once — run it from a checkout whose `.envrc` token can read all of them (typically a repo in the same GitHub org). MCP tools (`mcp__github__*`, `mcp__atlassian__*`) captured their credentials when Claude started and are unaffected.

## MCP Tools with Fallbacks

| Operation | MCP Tool | CLI Fallback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Search sprint issues | `mcp__atlassian__searchJiraIssuesUsingJql` with `sprint in openSprints()` | `jira sprint list --state active --raw` then `jira sprint list <ID> --raw` |
| Get issue with changelog | `mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue` (request fields + changelog) | `curl -s -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" "$JIRA_URL/rest/api/3/issue/<KEY>?expand=changelog"` |
| Get worklogs for issue | n/a via MCP | `curl -s -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" "$JIRA_URL/rest/api/3/issue/<KEY>/worklog"` |
| Get dev-info (linked PRs) | n/a via MCP | `curl -s -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" "$JIRA_URL/rest/dev-status/latest/issue/detail?issueId=<ID>&applicationType=GitHub&dataType=pullrequest"` |
| List PRs in a repo | `mcp__github__list_pull_requests` | `gh pr list --repo <owner>/<repo> --state all --search '...' --json ...` |
| List commits | `mcp__github__list_commits` | `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/commits?author=<user>&since=...&until=...` |
| Reviews given by user | `mcp__github__search_issues` (q: `is:pr reviewed-by:<user> updated:...`) | `gh search prs --reviewed-by <user> --updated <from>..<to> --json ...` |

**Always prefer MCP first.** On tool-not-found or repeated error, fall back to CLI. If `$JIRA_URL`, `$JIRA_EMAIL`, `$JIRA_API_TOKEN` are needed for curl and missing, try the `jira` CLI instead. If that also fails, ask the user to check credentials.

## Step 1: Resolve sprint and week window

1. Find the active sprint (or honor `--sprint`):

   ```bash
   jira sprint list --state active --table --plain --no-headers --columns ID,NAME,START,END
   ```

   If multiple active sprints exist, ask which one.

2. Extract `startDate` and `endDate` from the sprint (they are ISO timestamps). Source them from the raw sprint JSON:

   ```bash
   jira sprint list <SPRINT_ID> --raw | jq -r '.[0] // empty' >/dev/null  # confirm ID resolves
   # Sprint metadata:
   curl -s -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" "$JIRA_URL/rest/agile/1.0/sprint/<SPRINT_ID>" | jq '{name, startDate, endDate, state}'
   ```

3. **Determine the weekly-window mode, then compute the raw window.**

   First decide the mode (`past` or `current`):
   - If `--window` was passed, honor it.
   - Else if this is a non-interactive / `--send` run, use `past` (keeps scheduled weekly emails stable).
   - Else (interactive preview) **and** today is mid-week (not already the end of a completed week), **ask the user** with AskUserQuestion — one question, `multiSelect: false`, header `Window`:
     - Question: "This week is still in progress — which weekly window do you want?"
     - Option A (listed first, the default): **Past full week (Mon–Sun)** — the last completed 7-day week.
     - Option B: **Week-to-date (this Mon → today)** — partial current week; lets you run this report any day.
   - If today is Sunday end-of-day the two windows coincide; skip the prompt and use `past`.

   Then compute the raw window for the chosen mode:
   - **`past` (previous completed week):**
     - `week_end = most recent past Sunday 23:59 local` (if today is Sunday, use today − 7 days)
     - `week_start = week_end − 6 days at 00:00 local` (the Monday of that same week)
   - **`current` (week-to-date):**
     - `week_start = this week's Monday 00:00 local`
     - `week_end = today 23:59 local` (now). Partial window — fewer than 7 calendar days and possibly only 1–4 working days.
   - Apply `--week-offset N` to **either** mode by subtracting `7*N` days from both bounds (0 = the window above, 1 = the week before, …).
   - Record `window_mode` and a human label for the report header.

   **Partial-week handling (`current` mode only):**
   - `today` is still in progress, so don't penalize it: exclude today from the worklog "< 7h" short-day flag (Step 3) and from the `working_days_in_week` denominator used for PRs/day and Tickets/day (Step 6). The denominator is **completed** working days = Mon–Fri strictly before today within the window.
   - If completed working days < 2 (e.g. a Monday or Tuesday run), mark all per-day rates **provisional** in the header and why-lines, and do not assign 🔴 on rate alone — cap rate-only misses at 🟡. Stalled/stuck flags still stand.
   - Stuck-ticket and stalled-member detection use trailing-N-days / sprint-to-date windows and are unaffected by the weekly-window mode.

4. **Pick the weekly-anchor sprint** — the sprint whose tickets, transitions, PRs, and worklogs are the basis for every weekly-window metric in the report:
   - If `[week_start, week_end]` overlaps with the active sprint (any day in the window falls within `[sprint.startDate, sprint.endDate]`), the weekly-anchor sprint is the **active sprint**.
   - Otherwise (the whole weekly window falls before the active sprint — typically because the active sprint started after the previous Sunday), the weekly-anchor sprint is the **previous closed sprint** (the most recent sprint on the same board with `state=closed`). When this fallback fires, every weekly table is computed against that previous sprint's tickets and bounds, and the report header explicitly states `weekly-anchor sprint = <previous sprint name>`. Sprint-to-date metrics still target the active sprint.
   - **Clamp** the window to the chosen anchor sprint's bounds: `week_start = max(week_start, anchor.startDate)`, `week_end = min(week_end, anchor.endDate)`. Report dates in local time.
   - Never produce an empty weekly window. If clamping would invert the range under both choices, abort with an explanatory message and ask the user how to proceed.
   - Rationale: defaulting to the still-running week would be misleading because the team is mid-task — so `past` is the default and `current` (week-to-date) is an explicit opt-in (Step 1 item 3). But silently dropping the weekly section when the active sprint is fresh hides a full week of contribution — the previous-sprint fallback keeps the weekly view honest.

5. Compute the **sprint-to-date** window separately: `[active_sprint.startDate, today 23:59 local]`. This is used for sprint-achievability calculations and the "sprint-to-date" throughput table. Keep it distinct from the weekly window.

6. Extract the Jira server URL for browse links — prefer the env var, fall back to the jira-cli config (path varies by platform):

   ```bash
   JIRA_SERVER="${JIRA_URL:-$(grep -h '^server:' \
     ~/.config/.jira/.config.yml \
     ~/.jira/.config.yml \
     "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/.jira/.config.yml" \
     2>/dev/null | head -n1 | awk '{print $2}')}"
   ```

   If `$JIRA_SERVER` is empty, ask the user for the Jira base URL.

## Step 2: Build the roster

Fetch every issue in the active sprint (all types except Epics and Sub-tasks). Note that `jira sprint list` caps at 100 results per page, so paginate using key cursor until fewer than 100 are returned:

```bash
# first page
jira sprint list <SPRINT_ID> --plain --no-headers --no-truncate --columns TYPE,KEY,STATUS,ASSIGNEE > /tmp/sprint.tsv
# subsequent pages, using last key as cursor
last=$(tail -1 /tmp/sprint.tsv | awk -F'\t' '{print $2}')
while :; do
  jira issue list -q "sprint = <SPRINT_ID> AND key < '$last'" --plain --no-headers --no-truncate --columns TYPE,KEY,STATUS,ASSIGNEE > /tmp/page.tsv
  cnt=$(wc -l < /tmp/page.tsv); [ "$cnt" -eq 0 ] && break
  cat /tmp/page.tsv >> /tmp/sprint.tsv
  [ "$cnt" -lt 100 ] && break
  last=$(tail -1 /tmp/page.tsv | awk -F'\t' '{print $2}')
done
```

Extract per issue:

- `key`, `id`, `fields.summary`, `fields.status.name`, `fields.issuetype.name`, `fields.issuetype.subtask` (boolean)
- `fields.assignee.accountId`, `fields.assignee.displayName`, `fields.assignee.emailAddress`
- `fields.timeoriginalestimate`, `fields.timeestimate`, `fields.customfield_*` for story points (try `fields.customfield_10016` and `fields.customfield_10002` — pick whichever is numeric)
- `fields.customfield_*` for Sprint (array of sprint objects including historical sprints)
- **Hierarchy / links** (needed for the container roll-up in Step 6): `fields.parent.key`, `fields.subtasks[].{key,fields.status.name}`, and `fields.issuelinks[]` — for each link capture the link type name (`type.name`, e.g. `Blocks`, `Relates`, `Parent/Child`), the direction, and the linked issue's `{key, fields.status.name}` from whichever of `inwardIssue` / `outwardIssue` is present.

### Classify each issue: container vs leaf

Movement expectations differ by whether an issue does work itself or rolls up other work:

- **Container** = a Story, or any issue that has `fields.subtasks` **or** has "blocking"/"parent" style links to other issues (`Blocks`, `is blocked by`, `Parent/Child`, `Epic-Story`, or a project-specific equivalent). A container is a tracking/ownership wrapper: it is *expected* to sit parked on its owner (often a product owner — a `manager` or `other` role) and **cannot** transition to Done until its children/blockers do. The parent not moving is therefore **not** a stall signal on its own.
- **Leaf** = a Task, Bug, or any issue with no children and no blocking dependents — the actual unit of work whose movement (or lack of it) is the real signal.

Record `is_container` per issue, plus its `child_keys` = the set of sub-task keys ∪ blocked/child linked-issue keys. Leaf issues have `child_keys = ∅`. This classification feeds every movement check in Step 6 (stuck-ticket, stalled-member, and the `other`-role non-moving rule) so a parked container is never flagged in place of its real blocker.

Build the **roster** = unique assignees across all active-sprint issues. Skip unassigned issues for per-member sections (but include their totals in the team rollup). Do not assume roster members are engineers — many will be QA, content, or consultants. Use generic terms ("team member", "contributor") in all human-facing output.

### Detect the QA role

Critical for attribution: when a contributor moves a ticket to `in QA`, the ticket auto-reassigns to the QA tester. This means current `fields.assignee` reflects who holds the ticket now, not who did the upstream work. To correct:

1. Count how many current-sprint issues are currently in status `in QA` per assignee.
2. The assignee with a clear majority (≥ 60% of all `in QA` tickets) is the **QA tester**. Store as `qa_user`. If no one holds a clear majority, `qa_user = null` (team has no single tester and the QA-aware rules below are skipped).
3. **Do not classify runner-up "in QA" holders as testers** — those are escalation destinations (e.g. a CTO or tech lead who gets items the primary tester couldn't resolve). They are contributors / leaders, not QA.
4. The QA user's row in the team-at-a-glance table should be labelled with a `(QA)` suffix, and their "throughput" is counted as QA validations (transitions they made to `Done`), not feature completions.

Also fetch the **previous sprint** (same board, state=closed, most recent end date) for stalled-member comparison:

```bash
curl -s -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" "$JIRA_URL/rest/agile/1.0/board/<BOARD_ID>/sprint?state=closed" | jq '.values | sort_by(.endDate) | last'
```

If the board ID isn't obvious, get it from the active sprint's `originBoardId`.

## Step 2.5: Confirm member roles (interactive, cached)

Every roster member has a **role** that determines how they are rated and tracked. The role is confirmed by the human **once** and cached, so subsequent runs — including headless `--send` runs — reuse it without prompting. This makes the ratings honest: a part-time consultant or a CISO is not measured against a full-time developer's PR baseline, and an "other" member is not rated at all but is still watched for stalled work.

### Role catalog

| Role | Key | Rated on | Worklog hours expected | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Developer (full-time) | `developer` | PR/day on the 🟢🟡🔴 scale | yes (≥ 7h / working day) | the existing full rating; default for engineers |
| Consultant (part-time) | `consultant` | PRs only, **relaxed** (half) thresholds | no — exempt from worklog flags and from the time-logged table | don't penalize for part-time hours |
| Manager / CTO / CISO | `manager` | not rated on the PR scale (shows `—`) | no | leadership / escalation target; only flagged when an item escalated to them stalls |
| Tester | `tester` | QA validations & regressions logged | optional | this is the `qa_user`; never rated on PRs |
| Other (do not track) | `other` | not rated (shows `—`); excluded from throughput tables | no | **but still flagged if their issues aren't moving** — stuck/stalled checks still run and surface in the delivery-risk section |

### Load the role cache

Roles persist as JSON at `${WEEKLY_DEV_REPORT_ROLES:-$HOME/.config/weekly-dev-report/roles.json}`, keyed by Jira `accountId`:

```bash
ROLES_FILE="${WEEKLY_DEV_REPORT_ROLES:-$HOME/.config/weekly-dev-report/roles.json}"
```

Read it with the Read tool (it may not exist yet — that's fine, treat as `{}`). Each entry looks like:

```json
{
  "5f8a…": { "displayName": "Alice Ng", "email": "alice@…", "role": "developer", "confirmedAt": "2026-06-19" }
}
```

### Decide who to prompt

For each roster member, look up the cache by `accountId` (fall back to email). A member needs confirmation if **any** of:

- they are not in the cache, OR
- `--reconfirm-roles` was passed.

If every member is already cached and `--reconfirm-roles` was not passed, skip prompting entirely.

### Auto-detected default (pre-selected in the prompt)

Compute a sensible default so the human usually just accepts it:

- `member == qa_user` (Step 2 majority-holder) → default `tester`.
- member with **zero worklog entries in the trailing 28 days** (the same cheap JQL used in Step 3's time-table filter, `worklogAuthor = "<accountId>" AND worklogDate >= -28d`) → default `consultant`.
- a secondary "in QA" holder who is clearly a leader/escalation target (Step 2 item 3) → default `manager`.
- everyone else → default `developer`.

A cached role always takes precedence as the pre-selection over the auto-default (the human's last answer wins) unless `--reconfirm-roles` forces a fresh choice.

### Prompt (interactive runs only)

Only prompt when the run is a preview (no `--send`) and the session is interactive. Use the **AskUserQuestion** tool. AskUserQuestion takes up to 4 questions per call — batch members in groups of 4 and loop until all who-need-confirmation members are covered:

- One question per member. `header` = the member's first name (≤ 12 chars). `question` = e.g. `What is Alice Ng's role this sprint?`.
- Options (always these five, `multiSelect: false`): **Developer (full-time)**, **Consultant (part-time)**, **Manager / CTO / CISO**, **Tester**, **Other (don't track, notify if stuck)**. List the auto-detected default **first** and append " (detected)" to its label so it is the obvious pick.
- The user can always pick "Other" free-text via the built-in escape hatch; map any unrecognized answer to the closest role key, defaulting to `other`.

### Persist

After collecting answers, merge them into the role cache and write it back with the Write tool (create the parent dir first: `mkdir -p "$(dirname "$ROLES_FILE")"`). Stamp `confirmedAt` with today's date (already known from the run window — do not call `date` just for this if today is in scope). Never delete cache entries for members not in this sprint; only add/update.

### Non-interactive fallback (`--send` or no TTY)

Do **not** prompt. For each member use the cached role if present, else the auto-detected default. In the report header, list any members whose role came from an auto-default rather than a confirmed cache entry, e.g. `Roles: 9 confirmed, 2 auto-defaulted (run a preview to confirm)`. This keeps automated runs unblocked while making the gap visible.

Carry the resolved `member_role` for every member into Steps 6 (rating + delivery risk) and 7 (rendering).

## Step 3: Count transitions and fetch worklogs

### Cycle time per ticket (In Progress → Code Review)

For each ticket a member transitioned **into** `Code Review` or `in QA` during the weekly window, compute the most recent prior `In Progress` start time and take the delta:

```bash
curl -s -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" "$JIRA_URL/rest/api/3/issue/<KEY>?expand=changelog&fields=summary" \
  | jq '{
      key: .key,
      summary: .fields.summary,
      ip_to_cr_seconds: (
        (.changelog.histories
          | map({when: .created, items: .items})
          | map(.items[] |= ({when: .when} + .))
          | .[].items[]?
          | select(.field=="status")) as $h
        | null  # placeholder — see implementation note below
      )
    }'
```

Implementation note: the cleanest way is to walk `.changelog.histories | sort_by(.created)` and remember `last_in_progress_at`. When you hit a status change `to == "Code Review"` (or `to == "in QA"` if no Code Review step happened in between), record `delta = parsed(history.created) - last_in_progress_at`. If multiple In-Progress→Code-Review cycles happened on the same ticket, take the **last full cycle that ended within the weekly window**. Skip tickets whose cycle started before the previous sprint's start date (treat as no signal).

Aggregate per member:

- `cycle_seconds[]` = list of `delta` for each ticket they transitioned in the window
- `cycle_avg_hours` = mean of `cycle_seconds[]` ÷ 3600 (or `—` if zero tickets had a measurable cycle)

This number lands in the team-at-a-glance table as the "Avg cycle (IP→CR)" column (Step 7) and surfaces in the per-member section's why-line when it's significantly above team median.

### Transition counts per member (authoritative throughput metric)

Do **not** use current `fields.assignee` for throughput. Instead, count status transitions each user made within a given window. JQL `BY <user> DURING (...)` is cheap and avoids having to pull full changelogs:

```bash
# per member, per target status, per window
jira issue list -q 'sprint = <SPRINT_ID> AND status CHANGED TO "<status>" BY "<email>" DURING ("<from>", "<to>")' \
  --plain --no-headers --no-truncate --columns KEY | grep -c "^${KEY_PREFIX}-"
```

Important: when the user is invalid or has no results, the CLI prints a `✗ No result found` line. Always filter by `grep -c "^${KEY_PREFIX}-"` (not `wc -l`) to avoid counting that line as 1. `KEY_PREFIX` is read from the sprint's first issue key (Step 4) and is **not** hardcoded.

For each member in the roster (skipping `qa_user`), count transitions to **each** of these target states, for **each** of these windows:

| Target status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Code Review` | member opened a review (first hand-off) |
| `in QA` | member finished and handed to QA |
| `Done` | member closed directly (non-QA items) |
| `REJECTED` | triage dispatch (e.g. auto-filed PROD bugs dismissed as noise) |

Also collect, per member, the **set of tickets they touched in the week** = the union of issues returned by `status CHANGED ... BY <user> DURING (<window>)` across **any** transition (any source, any target). For each ticket store `{ key, summary }`. This list feeds the new `Tickets worked` column in the team-at-a-glance table (Step 7) and the per-member detail section. Always render Jira references as `[KEY](.../browse/KEY) — short summary` so the reader has context without clicking.

Windows:

- **Weekly** = `[week_start, week_end]` (previous completed Mon → Sun)
- **Sprint-to-date** = `[sprint.startDate, today]`

For `qa_user`: count transitions to `Done` (QA validations) and to `in QA` (kick-backs / regressions logged) across the same two windows.

### Full changelog (only where needed)

Only pull full changelogs for issues flagged for stuck-ticket analysis (Step 6). Do NOT expand changelogs for every sprint issue — that's hundreds of API calls and `BY ... DURING (...)` JQL already covers the throughput question.

```bash
curl -s -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" "$JIRA_URL/rest/api/3/issue/<KEY>?expand=changelog"
```

### Worklogs (per-member daily breakdown)

Fetch per issue in the **weekly-anchor sprint** (paginate via the worklog endpoint, which is unbounded unlike the 20-entry issue-view field):

```bash
curl -s -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" "$JIRA_URL/rest/api/3/issue/<KEY>/worklog?startAt=0&maxResults=1000" | jq '.worklogs'
```

For each entry, record `{ author.accountId, author.displayName, started, timeSpentSeconds, issueKey }`. Convert `started` to local timezone before bucketing.

**Roster filter for the time table.** Drop a member from the time-logged table if they have **zero worklog entries in the trailing 28 days from today**, across any issue (not just sprint issues). Run a cheap JQL `worklogAuthor = "<accountId>" AND worklogDate >= -28d` per roster member to confirm. These are typically consultants who don't log in Jira; they remain in throughput tables but are silently absent from the time table — do not mark them red, do not list them as "0h". The report header should state how many members were dropped from the time table for this reason.

For each remaining member, compute over `[week_start, week_end]`:

- `daily_hours[date]` = sum `timeSpentSeconds / 3600` for all entries whose local-day equals `date` (one bucket per Mon, Tue, … Sun in the window — pre-fill missing days with 0)
- `total_hours` = sum across the window
- `working_days_below_7h` = count of working days (Mon–Fri inside the window) where `daily_hours[date] < 7.0`. A working day with zero entries counts as 0h and triggers the flag. **In `current` (week-to-date) mode, exclude today** — it is still in progress and would otherwise flag everyone (see Step 1 partial-week handling).
- `pattern_flag` = true if the member has **≥ 3 entries in the window** AND every entry shares the same `started` time-of-day (HH:MM, local) AND the same `timeSpentSeconds`. Below 3 entries the signal is too noisy and the flag stays false.
- `logged_tickets` = distinct list of `{ key, summary }` for every issue that received a worklog entry from this member in the window. Resolve `summary` once per key (cache it — it's the same string for every entry on that ticket). This list renders into the new `Jira logged` column on the time-logged table (Step 7).

These per-member numbers feed both the rendered "Time logged" table (Step 7) and the rating formula (Step 6).

## Step 4: Discover linked GitHub repos

For each sprint issue, query the Jira dev-info API to find linked PRs:

```bash
curl -s -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" "$JIRA_URL/rest/dev-status/latest/issue/detail?issueId=<ID>&applicationType=GitHub&dataType=pullrequest" \
  | jq '.detail[0].pullRequests[]? | {url, status, author: .author.name, updated: .lastUpdate}'
```

Also check branches and commits:

```bash
curl -s -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" "$JIRA_URL/rest/dev-status/latest/issue/detail?issueId=<ID>&applicationType=GitHub&dataType=branch"
curl -s -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" "$JIRA_URL/rest/dev-status/latest/issue/detail?issueId=<ID>&applicationType=GitHub&dataType=repository"
```

From the PR URLs (e.g. `https://github.com/cloud-officer/foo/pull/123`), extract `owner/repo`. Build `REPOS` = the unique set across all sprint issues.

**If `REPOS` is empty** (dev-info not configured), fall back to: scan PR titles/branches for Jira keys via GitHub search:

```bash
gh search prs --owner cloud-officer "DEV-" --json repository,title,url --limit 200
```

Adjust `cloud-officer` and the ticket key prefix as appropriate (read prefix from the sprint's first issue key).

## Step 5: Gather GitHub metrics per member

### Auto-map GitHub users → Jira users via PR-to-transition links

The team's PR template requires Jira keys in PR titles/bodies. Cross-referencing a PR's referenced ticket with **who moved that ticket forward in Jira** (not its current assignee) gives a reliable auto-mapping. Current assignee is unreliable because of QA reassignment: most merged-PR tickets end up assigned to `qa_user`, so assignee-based mapping mis-labels every contributor as the QA tester.

Procedure:

1. For every repo in `REPOS`, list PRs merged in the sprint-to-date window and extract any `<PROJECT>-<NUM>` keys from the PR title, body, or head branch name:

   ```bash
   gh search prs --owner <org> "<KEY_PREFIX>-" --merged --merged-at "<sprint.startDate>..<today>" \
     --json number,title,author,repository,url --limit 400
   ```

2. Build the set of `(github_login, ticket_key)` pairs from step 1.

3. For each roster member (skipping `qa_user`), list the tickets they transitioned **out of** `In Progress` or `Code Review` within the sprint-to-date window:

   ```bash
   jira issue list -q 'sprint = <SPRINT_ID> AND status CHANGED FROM "In Progress" BY "<email>" DURING ("<from>", "<to>")' --plain --no-headers --columns KEY
   jira issue list -q 'sprint = <SPRINT_ID> AND status CHANGED FROM "Code Review"  BY "<email>" DURING ("<from>", "<to>")' --plain --no-headers --columns KEY
   ```

   The union of these is this member's "I worked on it" ticket set. This bypasses QA-reassignment entirely because it asks who did the transition, not who currently holds the ticket.

4. For each `(github_login, jira_user)` pair, count the number of distinct tickets that appear in both sets. Build `score[github_login][jira_user] = overlap_count`.

5. For each GitHub login, pick the Jira user with the highest score as its mapping. Require score ≥ 2 (at least 2 overlapping tickets) to confirm. Below that, the login is `ambiguous` — still include in the report but flag it.

6. Optional override: if env var `GITHUB_USERNAME_MAP` is set (format `email1=ghuser1,email2=ghuser2`), it **overrides** the auto-detected mapping for those emails. Use this as a last-resort manual patch only.

7. If auto-mapping still leaves a member unresolved (no PRs in the window), mark their GitHub columns as `—` and add a caveat. Do not block the report.

Never map via current `fields.assignee`, never guess by email local-part, never call `gh api users/<guess>`.

For each repo in `REPOS` and each resolved GitHub user, collect within `[week_start, week_end]`:

```bash
# PRs opened, merged, closed
gh pr list --repo <owner>/<repo> --state all --search "author:<user> created:<from>..<to>" --json number,title,state,createdAt,mergedAt,closedAt,url

# Commits authored
gh api "repos/<owner>/<repo>/commits?author=<user>&since=<from>T00:00:00Z&until=<to>T23:59:59Z" --paginate | jq '[.[] | {sha, message: .commit.message, date: .commit.author.date}]'

# Reviews given (across all in-scope repos — query once per user, not per repo)
gh search prs --reviewed-by <user> --updated "<from>..<to>" --json repository,number,title,url | jq --arg repos "<comma-joined-repos>" '[.[] | select((.repository.nameWithOwner) as $r | ($repos | split(",") | index($r) != null))]'

# Stale PRs (owned by user, awaiting review, older than 3 days)
gh pr list --repo <owner>/<repo> --author <user> --state open --json number,title,createdAt,updatedAt,reviewDecision,isDraft,url \
  | jq --arg cutoff "$(date -v-3d -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ 2>/dev/null || date -u -d '3 days ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
       '[.[] | select(.isDraft|not) | select(.reviewDecision != "APPROVED") | select(.updatedAt < $cutoff)]'
```

Compute per member:

- `prs_opened`, `prs_merged`, `prs_closed_unmerged`
- `commits_count`
- `reviews_given` — unique PRs they reviewed (authored by others)
- `median_cycle_time_hours` — median of `mergedAt - createdAt` for PRs merged in window
- `stale_prs` — list (rendered in a team-wide section, grouped by author)

## Step 6: Compute flags

### Container movement roll-up (apply before every "is it moving?" check)

A container issue (Story / parent / blocker — see Step 2 classification) is judged by its **children's** movement, never by its own status transitions. This stops the report from flagging a Story that is correctly parked on a product owner just because the wrapper hasn't moved, when the real situation is "child task X isn't done yet."

For each container, resolve the movement of its `child_keys` (sub-tasks + blocked/child linked issues) over the relevant window using the same `status CHANGED ... DURING (...)` JQL already used for throughput:

- **`container_is_moving`** = at least one child had a status transition in the window, OR at least one child is in an active (non-terminal, non–To-Do) status. → The container is healthy and **must not** be flagged as stalled/stuck. If you mention it at all, describe it as "parked, children in flight."
- **`container_is_blocked`** = the container cannot close **and every** child is itself stalled (no child transition in the trailing 14 days and none in progress) — typically because one or more **leaf** children are blocked or unstarted. → The real problem is those children, not the parent.

When a container is blocked, surface **the blocking child leaf issue(s)** — each with its **own** assignee and role — as the at-risk/stuck item, with a note like `blocks [PARENT] — parent parked on <owner> (product owner), waiting on this task`. Never attribute the stall to the parent's owner when they are just the product owner holding the wrapper; attribute it to whoever owns the unfinished child. If a blocked container genuinely has no child owner to point at (orphaned children, or no children at all), then and only then flag the container itself, owner included.

Leaf issues are unaffected by this subsection — their own movement is the signal, as before.

### Stuck ticket flag 🚩

Find candidate stuck tickets via JQL, paginating past the 100-result API cap using key cursor:

```bash
last="<ISSUE_PREFIX>-99999999"
while :; do
  jira issue list -q "sprint = <SPRINT_ID> AND sprint in closedSprints() AND updated < -14d AND key < '$last'" \
    --plain --no-headers --no-truncate --columns KEY,ASSIGNEE,SUMMARY,UPDATED > /tmp/stuck_page.tsv
  cnt=$(wc -l < /tmp/stuck_page.tsv); [ "$cnt" -eq 0 ] && break
  cat /tmp/stuck_page.tsv >> /tmp/stuck.tsv
  [ "$cnt" -lt 100 ] && break
  last=$(tail -1 /tmp/stuck_page.tsv | awk -F'\t' '{print $1}')
done
```

**Never** report a truncated stuck-ticket list. If pagination was needed, the report must show every stuck ticket, not just the first 100.

For each candidate, confirm the stricter rule — all of:

- Appeared in ≥ 3 distinct sprints (current + ≥ 2 prior) — derived from changelog Sprint field history
- No status transition in the last 7 days (from now, not the week window)
- No worklog entry AND no comment in the last 7 days
- **Container check:** if the candidate `is_container`, apply the roll-up above — skip it when `container_is_moving` (its children are active; the parent is just parked), and when `container_is_blocked` report the **blocking child leaf** in its place rather than the parent. A container is only listed as stuck in its own right when it has no movable child to attribute the stall to.

Fetch comments if needed:

```bash
curl -s -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" "$JIRA_URL/rest/api/3/issue/<KEY>/comment" | jq '[.comments[] | {created, author: .author.displayName}] | sort_by(.created) | last'
```

### Stalled member flag

For each member (excluding `qa_user`), flag if **all** of:

- Assigned ≤ 2 issues in the active sprint
- ≥ 50% of their active-sprint issue keys were also in the previous sprint
- Zero status transitions **authored by them** (via JQL `BY <user>`) on any sprint issue during both the week window and the full sprint-to-date window
- **At least one of their assigned issues is a leaf** (Task/Bug) — i.e. don't flag a member whose only sprint issues are containers they're parked on. If every one of their sprint issues `is_container` and each `container_is_moving`, they are product-owning live work, not stalled. (When a container they hold `is_blocked`, the entry goes to the blocking child's owner, per the roll-up — not to this member.)

The third condition checks **author of the transition**, not current assignee — a member who moved their last ticket to `in QA` and then got reassigned to QA should NOT be flagged as stalled. The fourth keeps a product owner who holds only Stories from being mislabelled stalled when their own work is the children's.

**Role-specific movement checks (Step 2.5 roles):**

- `other` (do-not-track): these members are not rated, but the explicit point of the role is "notify if issues aren't moving." So in addition to the strict stalled rule, flag **any sprint ticket they own that had zero status transitions in the sprint-to-date window** — regardless of how many issues they hold — **but apply the container roll-up first**. If the non-moving ticket `is_container` and `container_is_moving` (a Story parked on them as product owner while its children are in flight), it is **not** a stall — do not flag it. If it `is_container` and `container_is_blocked`, flag the **blocking child leaf and its owner** instead of the parent. Only a non-moving **leaf** they own (or a container with no movable child) becomes a stalled-member entry, surfaced in the ⚠️ Stalled-members section and the 🎯 Delivery-risk at-risk list with the note `untracked member — issue not moving`.
- `manager`: don't apply the stalled rule (low ticket counts are expected). But if an item that was **escalated to them** (e.g. moved to them out of QA) has had zero movement for ≥ 7 days, flag it as an escalation stall in the delivery-risk section. **Exclude containers they merely own as product owner** — a Story parked on a manager whose children are moving is normal ownership, not an escalation stall; apply the container roll-up and only flag a blocked leaf (attributed to the child's owner) or a genuinely escalated leaf.
- `tester` (`qa_user`): excluded from the stalled rule as today.

### Per-member rating (🟢🟡🔴)

The rating is anchored on **PR throughput per working day in the weekly window**, with hardness floors from the worklog data. PRs are the primary signal because, with AI assistance, "at least one PR per working day" is the team's working baseline. Note: not every roster member is expected to ship PRs (QA, content, consultants); the rating is meaningful for engineering contributors and is suppressed for the QA row. For non-engineering members the report should call out the role mismatch in the why-line so the rating isn't misread.

**Role gating (apply first, using `member_role` from Step 2.5):**

- `tester` (the `qa_user`): not rated on this scale — show QA metrics only (validations done, regressions logged). Rating cell = `—`.
- `manager`: not rated on the PR scale. Rating cell = `—`, why-line = `Leadership/escalation role — not rated on PR throughput.` Only raise a flag if an item escalated to them has stalled (feeds the delivery-risk and stuck-ticket sections).
- `other`: not rated. Rating cell = `—`, why-line = `Not tracked (role: other).` Excluded from the throughput tables. **Still run the stalled/stuck checks on their tickets** — if any of their sprint tickets haven't moved, surface them in the Stalled-members, Stuck-tickets, and Delivery-risk sections with the note `untracked member — issue not moving`.
- `consultant`: rated on PRs only, with **relaxed (half) thresholds**, and worklog flags forced false (they are exempt from the time table). Use the part-time bands below.
- `developer`: full rating exactly as specified below.

Inputs (all over `[week_start, week_end]` against the **weekly-anchor sprint** chosen in Step 1):

- `prs_merged_week` = number of PRs merged within the window where this member is the **author** (the opener), resolved via the GH→Jira map from Step 5; a PR counts iff `pr.author.login` maps to their Jira identity. The user who clicked merge does **not** get credit — that belongs to a separate `Reviews` / `merged-for-others` metric. Count merges only (not opens or closes-without-merge), and exclude bot/automation accounts.
- `working_days_in_week` = count of Mon–Fri inside `[week_start, week_end]` (typically 5; smaller if the window was clamped at a sprint boundary). **In `current` (week-to-date) mode, exclude today** (in progress) and count only completed working days; use `max(working_days_in_week, 1)` to avoid divide-by-zero on early-week runs, and treat per-day rates as **provisional** (cap rate-only misses at 🟡) when completed working days < 2.
- `pr_per_day` = `prs_merged_week / working_days_in_week`.
- `worklog_short_day` = true if any working day in the window has `daily_hours < 7.0` (from the worklog section). False (and irrelevant) if the member was dropped from the time table for the 28-day-no-entries rule.
- `worklog_pattern_flag` = the `pattern_flag` from the worklog section.
- `is_stalled` = stalled-member flag from this section above.

Rating rules (apply in order, first match wins):

- 🔴 **Red** if any: `is_stalled`, OR `pr_per_day < 0.5` (i.e. fewer than one PR every other working day).
- 🟡 **Yellow** if any: `pr_per_day < 1.0` (at least one PR every other day, but less than one PR per day), OR `worklog_short_day`, OR `worklog_pattern_flag`.
- 🟢 **Green** otherwise (`pr_per_day ≥ 1.0` AND no worklog flags).

The PR threshold is **per working day**. For a normal 5-working-day week:

- 🟢 ≥ 5 PRs merged
- 🟡 3 or 4 PRs merged (or ≥ 5 but with a worklog flag)
- 🔴 ≤ 2 PRs merged (or ⚠️ Stalled)

For a clamped 4-working-day week, the corresponding bands are ≥ 4 / 2–3 / ≤ 1, and so on.

**Consultant (part-time) bands** — halve the per-working-day thresholds, since a part-timer is not expected to ship daily, and never apply worklog flags:

- 🟢 **Green** if `pr_per_day ≥ 0.5` (about one PR every other working day).
- 🟡 **Yellow** if `0.25 ≤ pr_per_day < 0.5`.
- 🔴 **Red** if `pr_per_day < 0.25`, OR `is_stalled`.

The why-line must say "consultant (part-time)" so a 🟡 isn't read as underperformance, e.g. `"Yellow — consultant (part-time): 2 PRs / 5 working days = 0.4/day"`.

One-line "why" per rating: state the worst driver. Examples:

- `"Red — 1 PR / 5 working days = 0.2/day"`
- `"Red — ⚠️ Stalled (1 carryover ticket, 0 transitions sprint-to-date)"`
- `"Yellow — 4 PRs / 5 working days = 0.8/day"`
- `"Yellow — 6 PRs but Wed = 4h logged (< 7h)"`
- `"Yellow — 7 PRs but every worklog entry is 09:00 / 8h exactly"`
- `"Green — 8 PRs / 5 working days = 1.6/day"`

**Carve-outs.**

- `qa_user` (role `tester`) is not rated on this scale — their row shows QA-specific metrics (validations done, regressions logged).
- A member with role `consultant` (or excluded from the time table for the 28-day rule) is rated on PRs alone, on the relaxed part-time bands above — both worklog flags evaluate to false for them.
- Members with role `manager` or `other` are not rated (cell `—`) per the role gating above.
- Members flagged as **content team** or any other non-engineering role in the report's per-member caveats (e.g. via project memory) should still be rated, but the why-line must call out the role mismatch so the reader does not interpret a 🔴 as poor performance.

### Delivery risk assessment (sprint-goal tracking)

The point of this section is to tell the reader, in one glance, whether the sprint goal will be met — and if not, **exactly what to do to catch up**. Compute against the **active sprint** over the sprint-to-date window.

1. **Scope & progress.**
   - `total_work` = sum of story points across active-sprint issues **if ≥ 80% of issues carry points**; otherwise fall back to plain issue count.
   - `done_work` = same measure restricted to issues in a terminal status (Done / Closed / equivalent).
   - `completion_pct = done_work / total_work`.
2. **Time (working days only — exclude Sat/Sun, don't detect holidays).**
   - `sprint_working_days` = Mon–Fri in `[sprint.startDate, sprint.endDate]`.
   - `elapsed_working_days` = Mon–Fri in `[sprint.startDate, min(today, sprint.endDate)]`.
   - `working_days_left = sprint_working_days − elapsed_working_days`.
   - `expected_pct = elapsed_working_days / sprint_working_days` (the linear-burn baseline).
3. **Run rate.**
   - `current_rate = done_work / max(elapsed_working_days, 0.5)` (work units per working day so far).
   - `remaining_work = total_work − done_work`.
   - `required_rate = remaining_work / max(working_days_left, 0.5)` (rate needed to finish on time).
   - `rate_gap = required_rate − current_rate`.
4. **Sprint-goal status** (first match wins):
   - 🔴 **Off track** — `completion_pct < expected_pct − 0.25`, OR `required_rate > current_rate × 1.75`, OR `working_days_left ≤ 0` with `remaining_work > 0`.
   - 🟡 **At risk** — behind by 10–25 points (`expected_pct − completion_pct` in `[0.10, 0.25]`), OR `required_rate` is `1.25×–1.75×` the current rate.
   - 🟢 **On track** — otherwise (`completion_pct ≥ expected_pct − 0.10` and `required_rate ≤ current_rate × 1.25`).
5. **At-risk items.** Build the concrete list of what jeopardizes the goal — each with owner (+role), the reason, and a recommended action. Draw from:
   - Not-started or blocked tickets with the largest remaining estimate, and any P1/blocker priority.
   - Stuck tickets (the 🚩 flag above).
   - Tickets owned by **stalled** members, by 🔴-rated members holding goal-critical work, or by `other`-role members that haven't moved.
   - Review bottlenecks (the 🐢 section) that are blocking merges the goal depends on.
   - **For a blocked container** (a Story that can't close, per the roll-up): list the **blocking child leaf task** with **its own owner**, not the parent or the product owner. The reason reads `blocks [PARENT] — parent parked on <owner> (product owner)` and the action targets the child's owner (unblock / reassign / expedite the child). Never put a parked container's product owner on the at-risk list for the parent's lack of movement.
6. **Recommended course of action (the catch-up plan).** Produce a short, **prioritized** list. Every recommendation must name specific tickets and specific people — no generic advice. Choose and tailor from these levers:
   - **Re-balance** — move named tickets from overloaded / stalled / 🔴 owners to members with capacity (write it as `move DEV-1300 from Bob → Alice`).
   - **Unblock** — name the blocker and who can clear it (often the `manager` role).
   - **Expedite reviews** — assign a specific reviewer to the oldest blocking PRs to drain the 🐢 queue.
   - **Parallelize / pair** — pair two members on the highest-remaining-estimate item.
   - **Descope** — when `required_rate` is infeasible (`> ~2×` current rate with few days left), recommend the lowest-priority tickets to pull from the sprint to protect the goal, naming them. **Recommend only — never transition or edit Jira** (this skill is read-only).
   - **Escalate stuck items** — route each stuck ticket to the `manager` role with a named owner and a deadline.

   If the goal is 🟢 on track and there are no at-risk items, the plan is a single line: "On track — current run-rate sustains the sprint goal."

This feeds the "🎯 Delivery risk & recommended actions" render section in Step 7.

## Step 7: Render the report

Write to `WEEKLY_REPORT.md` in the current working directory, and print the same content. Every visual line break between sections, paragraphs, stats, and table captions must be a `<br>` (end-of-line or own-line) so markdown renderers don't collapse consecutive lines. Format:

````markdown

### At-risk items

| Item | Owner (role) | Why at risk | Recommended action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [DEV-1300](url) — Payment retry queue | Bob (developer, 🔴) | Not started, 8 pts, 3 working days left | Move DEV-1300 from Bob → Alice (has capacity); pair on the spec Mon AM |
| [DEV-1189](url) — Wire export endpoint | Dana (developer) | Leaf blocks [DEV-1188] — parent Story parked on Yves (product owner); this child unstarted 9 days | Unblock/expedite DEV-1189 with Dana; the Story closes once it lands |
| [#231](url) — Auth refactor | Alice (developer) | PR open 6 days, blocking 2 goal tickets | Assign <reviewer> today to clear the review |

### Catch-up plan (prioritized)

1. <concrete action naming tickets + people>
2. <…>
3. <…>

If 🟢 on track with no at-risk items, replace both subsections with a single line: "🟢 **On track** — no delivery risks flagged. Current run-rate sustains the sprint goal." Do not omit the section — its presence (and the explicit all-clear) is itself information.

## Team at a glance (weekly throughput)

Throughput is measured by status transitions authored by each user during the weekly window. Current `fields.assignee` is NOT used here (tickets auto-reassign when moved to in QA). The PR column counts merges where the member was the **author** of the PR (the opener), not the user who clicked merge — so when a tech lead merges someone else's PR, credit goes to the opener.

**Inclusion filter:** drop a roster member from this table if they had **zero status transitions AND zero authored-merged PRs** in the weekly window. Those rows aren't contribution activity; carrying them as 🔴 just adds noise. Dropped members may still appear in:

- the **Time logged** table (if they meet the 28-day worklog rule), and
- the **⚠️ Stalled members** section below (if they have an active sprint ticket that hasn't moved at all this sprint).

The header should state how many roster members were dropped under this filter so the reader knows the table is filtered, e.g. "_4 roster members omitted (no Jira movement and no authored PRs this week — see Stalled section if applicable)_".

`qa_user` is exempt from this filter and always shown if they had any activity.

**Role handling in this table:** the `Role` column shows the confirmed/auto-defaulted role from Step 2.5 (Developer / Consultant / Manager / Tester / Other), with the QA tester suffixed `(QA)`. Members with role `other` are **not** listed here (they are not tracked for throughput) — but if they hold a sprint ticket that hasn't moved, they appear in the ⚠️ Stalled-members section and the 🎯 Delivery-risk section instead. `manager` rows are shown when they have activity but always carry a `—` rating.

| Team member | Role | Rating | → Code Review | → in QA | → Done | → REJECTED | PRs authored & merged | PRs/day | Tickets/day | Avg cycle (IP→CR) | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | ---:| ---:| ---:| ---:| ---:| ---:| ---:| ---:| --- |
| Alice | Developer | 🟢 | 4 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 1.2 | 1.4 | 18h | Green — 6 PRs / 5 working days = 1.2/day |
| Bob | Developer | 🔴 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0.2 | 0.2 | — | Red — 1 PR / 5 working days = 0.2/day |
| Priya | Consultant | 🟡 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0.4 | 0.6 | 30h | Yellow — consultant (part-time): 2 PRs = 0.4/day |
| Sam | Manager | — | — | 1 | 3 | — | — | — | 0.8 | n/a | Leadership/escalation role — not rated on PR throughput |
| Jamie | Tester (QA) | — | — | 2 | 20 | — | — | — | 4.4 | n/a | QA validations |

Rows sorted: 🔴 first, 🟡 next, 🟢 next, then the non-rated `—` rows (`manager`, then `tester`/`qa_user`) last. Break ties by `PRs authored & merged` descending, then `→ in QA` descending.

Column rules:

- `Tickets/day` = (count of distinct tickets touched by transitions in the week) ÷ working days. Reflects how many *different* pieces of work the member moved, complementing `PRs/day` which only counts merges.
- `Avg cycle (IP→CR)` = average of `(Code Review timestamp − last In Progress timestamp)` for tickets the member transitioned to Code Review (or to in QA when they skipped CR) during the window. Shown in hours when < 48h, in days otherwise. `—` when the member moved no tickets through that gate this week.

Keep the table focused on numbers — the **list of tickets each member transitioned this week** lives in the per-member detail section below (Step 7 / per-member detail), not in this table. That keeps each row to a single line and prevents the table from growing horizontally past the screen.

## Time logged (week window)

Members with **zero worklog entries in the trailing 28 days from today** are omitted from this table — typically consultants who don't log to Jira. The header notes how many were dropped under that rule.

| Team member | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun | Total | Flags | Jira logged |
| --- | ---:| ---:| ---:| ---:| ---:| ---:| ---:| ---:| --- | --- |
| Alice | 8.0 | 7.5 | 7.5 | 8.0 | 8.0 | — | — | 39.0 | — | • [DEV-1201](url) — Add X endpoint <br> • [DEV-1205](url) — Fix Y bug |
| Bob | 4.0 | 8.0 | 8.0 | 8.0 | 8.0 | — | — | 36.0 | ⚠️ Mon < 7h | • [DEV-1310](url) — Refactor auth |
| Carol | 8.0 | 8.0 | 8.0 | 8.0 | 8.0 | — | — | 40.0 | ⚠️ every entry is 09:00 / 8h exactly | • [DEV-1599](url) — Maintenance bucket |

Render rules:

- One row per member still in scope after the 28-day filter, sorted by total hours descending.
- `Sat`/`Sun` columns show `—` when there are no entries (weekend work is allowed but not expected; never flagged).
- Working-day cells (Mon–Fri inside the window) showing `< 7h` are bolded so the eye can scan the column.
- Flags column lists, comma-separated: any working day under 7h (e.g. `⚠️ Wed < 7h`); the pattern flag if active (e.g. `⚠️ every entry is HH:MM / Nh exactly`); both if both apply.
- If the entire team triggers the pattern flag, surface a header note ("⚠️ Worklog entry pattern across team — verify clocking practice") rather than tagging every row individually.
- `Jira logged` column = bullet list of every distinct ticket that received a worklog entry from the member in the window, formatted `[KEY](url) — summary`. One bullet per row, `<br>` between bullets. If a member logged on > 8 distinct tickets, show the 8 with the most hours and append `… (+N more)`.

## Sprint-to-date throughput

Same columns as above but covering `[sprint.startDate, today]`. This is the view that correctly credits members for work that has since been reassigned to QA.

## Who holds what now (current-assignee snapshot)

A separate, lower-priority table showing current `fields.assignee` counts by status. Useful for "what is in my queue" but explicitly labelled as a holdings snapshot, not throughput. Keep this below the throughput tables so readers don't confuse the two.

## Releases this week (Jira ↔ GitHub reconciliation)

For the weekly window, fetch:

1. **Jira releases** — for each in-scope project (typically the project that owns the active sprint, e.g. DEV):

   ```bash
   curl -s -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" "$JIRA_URL/rest/api/3/project/<PROJECT_KEY>/versions" \
     | jq --arg ws "$WEEK_START" --arg we "$WEEK_END" \
          '[.[] | select(.released==true and (.releaseDate // "") >= $ws and (.releaseDate // "") <= $we) | {name, releaseDate, description, projectId}]'
   ```

2. **GitHub releases / tags** — per repo discovered in Step 4:

   ```bash
   gh release list --repo <owner>/<repo> --limit 50 --json tagName,publishedAt,name
   gh api "repos/<owner>/<repo>/tags?per_page=100" --jq '.[] | {tag: .name, sha: .commit.sha}'
   ```

   Filter by `publishedAt` falling inside the weekly window (`gh release list` is the cleanest source; raw tags fall back when no formal release was created).

3. **Reconcile** — match Jira version names to GitHub tag/release names. Normalize aggressively (case-insensitive, strip leading `v`, allow trailing `-rc`/`-beta` suffix variants). For each Jira release, expected counterparts are:

   - exact tag in the relevant repo(s) — green ✅
   - GitHub release exists but tag spelling differs (e.g. Jira `12.4.0` vs GitHub `v12.4.0`) — yellow ⚠️ "name normalization" (still considered matched)
   - no GitHub tag/release within the window — red ❌ "Jira marks released, GitHub has no tag"
   - GitHub tag without a Jira release version — yellow ⚠️ "untracked GitHub release"

Render:

| Release | Date | Jira project / version | GitHub repo / tag | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 12.4.0 | 2026-04-29 | DEV / 12.4.0 (Android) | ugroupmedia/pnp-android / v12.4.0 | ✅ matched |
| 8.1.2 | 2026-04-30 | DEV / 8.1.2 (API) | ugroupmedia/pnp-api / 8.1.2 | ⚠️ name normalized (Jira `8.1.2` ↔ GitHub `8.1.2`) |
| n/a | 2026-04-28 | _(missing)_ | ugroupmedia/pnp-web-next / 2026.04.28-rc | ⚠️ untracked GitHub release |
| 1.5.0 | 2026-05-01 | DEV / 1.5.0 (Scripts) | _(none)_ | ❌ Jira released, no GitHub tag |

If neither Jira nor GitHub had any releases in the window, render the section as a single line: "_No releases this week._" Do not omit the section entirely — its absence is itself information.

## 🚩 Stuck tickets (carryover with no activity)

| Ticket | Assignee | Sprints bounced | Last status change | Last worklog |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [DEV-1234](<SERVER>/browse/DEV-1234) | Bob | 4 | 2026-03-15 | 2026-03-18 |

Omit section entirely if no stuck tickets.

## 🐢 Review bottlenecks

| PR | Author | Repo | Age | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [#123](url) | Alice | cloud-officer/foo | 5 days | CHANGES_REQUESTED |

Top 10 oldest open non-draft PRs across in-scope repos, awaiting review or with changes requested. Omit if empty.

## Per-member detail

Each member's heading carries their role: `### <Name> — <Role> — <rating>`. For `manager`, `tester`, and `other` roles the rating is `—` (see role gating in Step 6).

### Alice — Developer — 🟢

_On track. 4 of 6 tickets moved to Done this week._

**Tickets transitioned this week** (full list — bullet per ticket, format `[KEY](url) — summary`):

- [DEV-1201](url) — Add X endpoint — **Done** (moved Wed)
- [DEV-1205](url) — Fix Y bug — **In Review**
- ...

**Pull requests (cloud-officer/foo)**
- [#142](url) — Merged Tue — "Add X endpoint" — DEV-1201
- [#145](url) — Open, awaiting review — DEV-1205

**Worklog:** 38.5h / 40h expected pro-rata

---

### Bob — Developer — 🔴  ⚠️ Stalled

_Only 2 sprint tickets, both carried over from previous sprint with no status change this week. 12h logged against 40h expected._

(same sub-sections as above)

---

<Repeat per member, 🔴 → 🟡 → 🟢>
````

Rendering rules:

- Every Jira key is a link: `[DEV-1234](<SERVER>/browse/DEV-1234)`
- Every PR is a link to its GitHub URL
- Times and dates in local timezone, formatted `YYYY-MM-DD` (no time unless needed for staleness)
- Never include internal JSON, shell output, or debug info in the rendered report
- Escape pipes (`|`) in table cells

## Step 8: Deliver

If run without `--send`:

1. Write `WEEKLY_REPORT.md` to the current directory
2. Print the file contents to stdout
3. End with a single line: `Preview written to WEEKLY_REPORT.md. Re-run with --send to email.`

If run with `--send`:

1. Build the recipient list: primary = `$WEEKLY_DEV_REPORT_TO` (abort if unset); append each address from `WEEKLY_DEV_REPORT_CC` (comma-separated, ignore empty entries, dedupe)
2. Subject: `Weekly Dev Report — <sprint name> — <week_start> to <week_end>`
3. Body: the rendered Markdown. If the available Gmail transport supports HTML, render the Markdown to HTML first (simple conversion: tables → `<table>`, headings → `<hN>`, links → `<a href>`); otherwise send as plain text with Markdown preserved.
4. Try delivery in this order:
   - Any available Google Workspace MCP tool whose name matches `mcp__*gmail*send*` or `mcp__google*workspace*gmail*` — discover via the tool list at runtime, do not hardcode
   - `gmail send` CLI if installed (`which gmail`)
   - `gcloud` SMTP relay if configured
5. On success, print `Sent to: <list>`. On failure, leave `WEEKLY_REPORT.md` in place, print the error, and instruct the user to send manually.

## Important rules

- **No Jira writes.** This skill only reads from Jira. Never create, edit, transition, or comment on issues.
- **No GitHub writes.** Never comment, merge, close, or otherwise modify PRs or issues.
- **No email unless `--send` is explicitly passed.** A run without that flag must be a pure preview.
- **Secrets.** Never print `JIRA_API_TOKEN`, GitHub tokens, or email addresses from `WEEKLY_DEV_REPORT_CC` into the report body or stdout. Recipient list is OK to echo on successful send.
- **Timeout.** 20-second timeout on each `jira`, `curl`, and `gh` call. Network flakes happen; retry once, then log a warning and continue rather than aborting the whole run.
- **Partial data is fine.** If one member's GitHub data fails to resolve, mark their row "GitHub data unavailable" and continue. The report is better incomplete than missing.
- **Roster source is authoritative.** If someone has no active-sprint tickets but did GitHub work this week, they are NOT in the report. The sprint is the lens.
- **Generic role language.** The roster mixes engineers, QA, content/media folks, and consultants. Never call the report or its rows "developers" or assume engineering as a default — use "team member", "member", "contributor", or the explicitly detected role (`QA`, content team, consultant). The rendered title is "Weekly Activity Report", not "Weekly Developer Report".
- **Throughput via transitions, never assignee.** Current `fields.assignee` is a holdings signal, not a throughput signal, because the workflow auto-reassigns tickets at `in QA`. The Team-at-a-glance and per-member sections must derive throughput from `status CHANGED TO <X> BY <user> DURING (...)`.
- **QA role auto-detected, not hardcoded.** Never hardcode a tester's name or email in the skill. Always detect via the majority-holder rule in Step 2 and label their row `(QA)`. Secondary "in QA" holders (e.g. a CTO receiving escalations) are contributors / leaders, not QA.
- **Weekly window: `past` (default) or `current`.** By default the weekly window is the previous completed Mon → Sun (a fixed 7-day week) — stable for scheduled emails and never mid-flight. The user may opt into `current` (week-to-date: this Mon → today) via `--window current` or the Step 1 prompt, so the report can be run any day. In `current` mode the window is partial: exclude **today** from worklog short-day flags and from per-day rate denominators, and mark early-week results provisional (cap rate-only misses at 🟡) — see Step 1 partial-week handling. When the chosen window falls entirely outside the active sprint (the active sprint is brand-new), use the previous closed sprint as the **weekly-anchor sprint** instead of producing an empty report — see Step 1 item 4.
- **Per-day PR threshold drives the rating.** 🟢 ≥ 1 PR per working day, 🟡 ≥ 0.5/day, 🔴 < 0.5/day or ⚠️ Stalled. Worklog flags (any working day < 7h, or every entry sharing the same start-time + duration) cap a member at 🟡. See Step 6.
- **Time table omits no-clock consultants.** Drop a member from the time-logged table if they have zero worklog entries in the trailing 28 days. They stay in the throughput tables and are still rated on PRs.
- **Throughput table omits non-contributors.** Drop a roster member from the team-at-a-glance and per-member sections if they had zero Jira transitions AND zero authored-merged PRs in the weekly window. Those rows are not contribution activity. They may still show up in the Time-logged table (if they clocked) or the Stalled section (if they hold a sprint ticket that hasn't moved). The report header should state the count of dropped rows.
- **PR credit goes to the author, never the merger.** A PR counts for whoever opened it, even when someone else hits the merge button. "Merged X PRs for other people" is a separate metric and belongs in a Reviews / merged-for-others column, not in the member's authored-PR count.
- **Always cite Jira tickets with key + summary.** Every Jira reference rendered in the report — in tables, bullets, why-lines, captions, anywhere — must read `[KEY](.../browse/KEY) — short summary`. A bare `DEV-1234` link is not enough; the reader needs the title to understand without clicking. Truncate summaries to ~80 chars if needed but never omit them.
- **Releases reconciled across Jira and GitHub.** The Releases-this-week section must compare Jira `released==true` versions in the window with GitHub tags / releases in the same window and surface mismatches. If neither system has releases in the window, render an explicit "*No releases this week.*" line — do not silently omit the section.
- **No skill / process meta-commentary in the rendered report.** The output is a status report for the team — never include sections like "Skill changes shipped this run", "Implementation notes", "TODOs for the script", or any other description of how the report was produced. Those belong in commit messages and the skill source itself, not in `WEEKLY_REPORT.md`. The report ends after the per-member detail and the trailing "Preview written to WEEKLY_REPORT.md. Re-run with --send to email." line.
- **Working days.** When computing `days_left` and `expected_hours`, exclude Saturdays and Sundays. Do not attempt to detect holidays.
- **Roles confirmed once, then cached.** Per-member roles (Step 2.5) are confirmed by the human via AskUserQuestion and persisted to the role cache. Re-prompt only for members missing from the cache, or for everyone when `--reconfirm-roles` is passed. Never prompt during a `--send` / non-interactive run — fall back to cache + auto-defaults and report how many were auto-defaulted.
- **Role-aware rating.** Each member is rated according to their role: `developer` on the full PR/day scale, `consultant` on relaxed (half) part-time bands with no worklog flags, `tester` on QA metrics, and `manager`/`other` not rated (cell `—`). Never measure a part-timer, leader, or untracked member against the full-time developer baseline.
- **Untracked ('other') members still surface non-moving work.** Role `other` means "do not track" for rating/throughput — but their sprint tickets are still checked for movement, and any **leaf** ticket with zero transitions sprint-to-date must appear in the Stalled-members and Delivery-risk sections noted `untracked member — issue not moving`. Apply the container roll-up first: a parked container (Story) whose children are moving is never flagged.
- **Containers are judged by their children, never by the wrapper.** A Story / parent / blocker is a roll-up that is *expected* to sit parked on its owner (often a product owner — `manager` or `other`) and **cannot** transition to Done until its children/blockers do. Stuck-ticket, stalled-member, and `other`/`manager`-role movement checks must apply the Step 6 container roll-up: skip a container whose children are active, and when a container is blocked, attribute the at-risk/stuck entry to the **blocking child leaf and its owner**, not to the parent or its product owner. Only flag the container itself when it has no movable child to point at. This prevents false "zero movement in N days" stalls on correctly-parked Stories (the real signal is the unfinished child task).
- **Delivery risk is actionable and read-only.** The 🎯 Delivery-risk section must state the sprint-goal status (🟢/🟡/🔴), the burn-vs-required rate, the specific at-risk items, and a prioritized catch-up plan whose every step names concrete tickets and people. Descope and reassignment are **recommendations only** — never transition, reassign, comment on, or otherwise modify Jira or GitHub.
- **Env vars referenced** (document at the top of output if any are unset and affect the run):
  - `WEEKLY_DEV_REPORT_TO` — required when `--send` is used; primary email recipient
  - `WEEKLY_DEV_REPORT_CC` — optional additional email recipients (comma-separated)
  - `GITHUB_USERNAME_MAP` — optional `email=ghuser` manual override on top of auto-mapping (Step 5)
  - `WEEKLY_DEV_REPORT_ROLES` — optional path to the role cache JSON (Step 2.5); defaults to `~/.config/weekly-dev-report/roles.json`
  - `JIRA_URL`, `JIRA_EMAIL`, `JIRA_API_TOKEN` — required for curl-based Jira calls (dev-info, changelog, worklog); if unset, try `jira` CLI equivalents
