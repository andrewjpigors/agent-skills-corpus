Implement the **$ARGUMENTS** command as a builtin in `interp/`.

---

## ⛔ STOP — READ THIS BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE ⛔

You MUST follow this execution protocol. Skipping steps has caused defects in every prior run of this skill.

### 1. Create the full task list FIRST

Your very first action — before reading ANY files, before writing ANY code — is to call TaskCreate exactly 10 times, once for each step below (Steps 1–10). Use these exact subjects:

1. "Step 1: Research the command"
2. "Step 2: User confirms which flags to implement"
3. "Step 3: Set up POSIX tests"
4. "Step 4: Implement Go tests"
5. "Step 5: Implement the $ARGUMENTS command"
6. "Step 6: Verify and Harden"
7. "Step 7: Code review"
8. "Step 8: Exploratory pentest"
9. "Step 9: Write fuzz tests"
10. "Step 10: Update documentation"

### 2. Execution order and gating

Steps run in this order:

```
Step 1 → Step 2 → Steps 3 + 4 + 5 (parallel) → Step 6 → Step 7 → Step 8
```

**Sequential steps (1 → 2):** Before starting step N, call TaskList and verify step N-1 is `completed`. Set step N to `in_progress`.

**Parallel steps (3, 4, 5):** Once Step 2 is `completed`, set Steps 3, 4, and 5 all to `in_progress` at the same time and work on all three concurrently. The implementation (Step 5) and the tests (Steps 3, 4) are all guided by the approved spec from Step 2 — they do not need to wait for each other.

**Convergence (6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10):** Before starting Step 6, call TaskList and verify Steps 3, 4, AND 5 are all `completed`. Then proceed sequentially through 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10.

Before marking any step as `completed`:
- Re-read the step description and verify every sub-bullet is satisfied
- If any sub-bullet is not done, keep working — do NOT mark it completed

### 3. Never skip steps

- Do NOT skip research (Step 1) because you think you already know the command
- Do NOT skip shell tests (Step 3) — download and adapt the GNU coreutils tests
- Do NOT skip review (Step 7) or pentest (Step 8) because "tests pass"
- Steps 1 and 2 require user interaction — do NOT auto-approve on the user's behalf

If you catch yourself wanting to skip a step, STOP and do the step anyway.

## Context

The safe shell interpreter (`interp/`) implements all commands as Go builtins — it never executes host binaries. All security and safety constraints are defined in `docs/RULES.md` at the repository root. Read that file first before writing any code.

Key structural facts about this codebase:
- Builtin implementations live in `interp/builtins/` (`package builtins`), one file per command
- Each builtin is a standalone function (not a method on Runner): `func builtinCmd(ctx context.Context, callCtx *CallContext, args []string) Result`
- File access MUST go through `callCtx.OpenFile()` — never `os.Open()` directly
- Output goes to `callCtx.Stdout`/`callCtx.Stderr` via `callCtx.Out()`, `callCtx.Outf()`, `callCtx.Errf()`
- Return `Result{}` for success, `Result{Code: 1}` for failure
- Builtins are registered in the `registry` map in `interp/builtins/builtins.go`

## Step 1: Research the command

Before writing any code:

1. Read `docs/RULES.md` in full.
2. Read the POSIX specification behavior for **$ARGUMENTS** — what flags are standard, what flags are dangerous (write/execute), and what the expected output format is.
3. Read the associated GTFOBins recommendations, if any. First check if the offline resource exists at `resources/gtfobins/$ARGUMENTS.md`. If it does, read it directly. If it does not exist, fetch it from https://gtfobins.org/gtfobins/$ARGUMENTS. These contain information on unsafe flags and vulnerabilities that we will need to avoid.

## Step 2: User confirms which flags to implement

Based on your research, suggest which flags should originally be supported as part of implementing this command.
All flags must obey the rules from RULES.md. Our goal here is to implement the most common flags which
obey RULES.md. Use your knowledge of these tools to help determine which flags are common and worth implementing.
For the original implementation, err on the side of selecting fewer, more important flags.

Determine:
- Which flags are safe to support (read-only, no exec)
- Which flags MUST be rejected with a clear error (any that write, delete, or execute)
- stdin support (does the command read from stdin when no files are given?)
- Exit code behavior (when should it return 0 vs 1?)
- Memory safety approach (streaming vs buffered, max sizes)
- Whether the command could read indefinitely from an infinite source (e.g. stdin from /dev/zero) — if so, it will need `context.Context` threading (see Step 5)

Show the user a summary that describes each standard flag
you found in the POSIX documentation. Group the flags by "will implement", "maybe implement", and "do not implement."
For each flag, show the flag name and a very brief (1-2 sentence) description of what it does.

Enter plan mode with `EnterPlanMode` and present the flag list and implementation approach. Wait for user approval.

Once the user has confirmed the flags to be implemented, we will create the first bit of Go code
for our command implementation. Create `interp/builtins/$ARGUMENTS.go` (`package builtins`)
with just the package header and a detailed doc comment describing the command and listing all
accepted flags that will be implemented.

## Step 3: Set up POSIX tests

**GATE CHECK**: Call TaskList. Step 2 must be `completed` before starting this step. Set Steps 3, 4, and 5 all to `in_progress` now — they run in parallel.

Locate two reference test suites. First check if the offline resources exist in the repo (downloaded via the `/download-posix-resources` command). If the offline resources are not available, download them:

```bash
# Check for offline resources first
if [ -d "resources/gnu-coreutils-tests" ] && [ -d "resources/uutils-tests" ]; then
    echo "Using offline resources from resources/"
else
    echo "Offline resources not found, downloading..."
    # GNU coreutils — GPL v3; use as reference for test *design*, not verbatim copy
    curl -sL https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz | tar -xz -C /tmp
    # uutils/coreutils Rust rewrite — MIT license; test logic can be freely adapted
    curl -sL https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz | tar -xz -C /tmp
fi
```

**GNU coreutils**: Look for test cases in the offline resources at `resources/gnu-coreutils-tests/$ARGUMENTS/`, or if downloaded to `/tmp`, at `/tmp/coreutils-master/tests/$ARGUMENTS/`. For each test file:

1. **Filter**: Skip tests wholly concerned with flags we decided not to implement (e.g. `--follow`, inotify, `--pid`). Also skip tests that rely on obsolete POSIX2 syntax (e.g. `_POSIX2_VERSION` env var, combined flag+number forms like `-1l`), platform-specific kernel features (`/proc`, `/sys`), or the GNU test framework helpers (`retry_delay_`, `compare`, `framework_failure_`).

**uutils/coreutils**: Look for test cases in the offline resources at `resources/uutils-tests/test_$ARGUMENTS.rs`, or if downloaded to `/tmp`, at `/tmp/coreutils-main/tests/by-util/test_$ARGUMENTS.rs`. Because uutils tests are MIT-licensed, the test logic and inputs/outputs can be adapted more freely. uutils tests tend to cover:
- Negative count modes (`-n -N`, `-c -N`) — skip if we did not implement these
- Obsolete positional syntax (`-1`, `-14c`)
- Multi-file header edge cases (`-v`, `-q`, `--silent`)
- Bad UTF-8 / binary passthrough
- Large-value integer edge cases and overflow guards
- Write-error handling (pipes writing to `/dev/full`)

Cross-reference both sources: if a case appears in uutils but not GNU coreutils (or vice versa), it is often worth including — uutils fills gaps the GNU shell test scripts miss.

2. **Translate**: For each remaining test case from either source, create one YAML scenario file at `tests/scenarios/cmd/$ARGUMENTS/`. The YAML format is:

```yaml
description: One sentence describing what this scenario tests.
setup:
  files:
    - path: relative/path/in/tempdir
      content: "file content here"
      chmod: 0644           # optional
      symlink: target/path  # optional; creates a symlink instead of a file
input:
  allowed_paths: ["$DIR"]   # "$DIR" resolves to the temp dir; omit to block all file access
  script: |+
    $ARGUMENTS some/file
expect:
  stdout: "expected output\n"    # exact match
  stdout_contains: ["substring"] # list; use instead of stdout for partial matches
  stderr: ""                     # exact match; use stderr_contains for partial matches
  stderr_contains: ["partial"]   # list
  exit_code: 0
```

**`stdout_contains` and `stderr_contains` must be YAML lists**, not scalar strings.
`stdout_contains: "text"` is invalid — always write `stdout_contains: ["text"]`.

Group scenario files into subdirectories by concern (e.g. `lines/`, `bytes/`, `headers/`, `stdin/`, `errors/`, `hardening/`).

**`stderr` vs `stderr_contains`**: Prefer `expect.stderr` (exact match) over `stderr_contains` (substring) unless the error message contains platform-specific text.

Note the source test in a comment at the top of each YAML file (e.g. `# Derived from GNU coreutils tail.pl test n-3` or `# Derived from uutils test_tail.rs::test_n_3`).

Write scenarios covering:
- Each implemented flag at least once
- Edge cases: empty file, single-line file, file with no trailing newline
- Error cases: missing file, directory as argument, invalid flag/argument values
- Flags that should be rejected (e.g. `-f`, `--follow`): verify `exit_code: 1` and stderr message

## Step 4: Implement Go tests

**PARALLEL STEP**: This runs concurrently with Steps 3 and 5. No gate check needed — Step 2 being `completed` is sufficient.

Files are organized as follows:

- **Implementation** → `interp/builtins/$ARGUMENTS.go` (`package builtins`)
- **Go tests** → `interp/builtins/tests/$ARGUMENTS/` (`package $ARGUMENTS_test`)
- **YAML scenarios** → `tests/scenarios/cmd/$ARGUMENTS/` (already done in Step 3)

The `builtins/tests/$ARGUMENTS/` directory contains **only** `_test.go` files. Go does not
include test-only directories in the real import graph, so there is no import cycle even though
the tests import `interp` (which imports `builtins`). The implementation stays flat in `builtins/`
and is registered there; the subdirectory is purely for test organization.

Do **not** put the implementation in `tests/` — that would require the sub-package to import
`builtins` for `CallContext`/`Result`, while `builtins` imports the sub-package for registration,
creating a cycle.

All test files use `package $ARGUMENTS_test`. They import `interp` (not `builtins` directly) and
exercise the command end-to-end through the shell runner.

### Exit code behaviour in Go tests

`runScript` returns `(stdout, stderr string, exitCode int)` — you can assert the exit code directly
without writing any custom helper. Builtins signal failure via `Result{Code: 1}`, which the
interpreter converts to an `ExitStatus` error that `runScript` already unwraps for you.

To verify that a command rejected a bad flag or argument, check both stderr and the returned exit
code:

```go
_, stderr, code := runScript(t, "tail --follow file", dir, interp.AllowedPaths([]string{dir}))
assert.Equal(t, 1, code)
assert.Contains(t, stderr, "tail:")
```

### Test helpers

Each test file requires a local `runScript` helper (since it is in `package $ARGUMENTS_test`, not
`package interp_test`). Define it at the top of `tests/$ARGUMENTS/$ARGUMENTS_test.go` along with `runScriptCtx`
for timeout-aware tests:

```go
func runScript(t *testing.T, script, dir string, opts ...interp.RunnerOption) (string, string, int) {
    t.Helper()
    return runScriptCtx(context.Background(), t, script, dir, opts...)
}

func runScriptCtx(ctx context.Context, t *testing.T, script, dir string, opts ...interp.RunnerOption) (string, string, int) {
    t.Helper()
    parser := syntax.NewParser()
    prog, err := parser.Parse(strings.NewReader(script), "")
    require.NoError(t, err)
    var outBuf, errBuf bytes.Buffer
    allOpts := append([]interp.RunnerOption{interp.StdIO(nil, &outBuf, &errBuf)}, opts...)
    runner, err := interp.New(allOpts...)
    require.NoError(t, err)
    defer runner.Close()
    if dir != "" {
        runner.Dir = dir
    }
    err = runner.Run(ctx, prog)
    exitCode := 0
    if err != nil {
        var es interp.ExitStatus
        if errors.As(err, &es) {
            exitCode = int(es)
        } else if ctx.Err() == nil {
            t.Fatalf("unexpected error: %v", err)
        }
    }
    return outBuf.String(), errBuf.String(), exitCode
}
```

### Command-specific run wrapper

To avoid repeating `interp.AllowedPaths([]string{dir})` on every call, define a wrapper at the
top of `$ARGUMENTS_test.go`:

```go
func cmdRun(t *testing.T, script, dir string) (stdout, stderr string, exitCode int) {
    t.Helper()
    return runScript(t, script, dir, interp.AllowedPaths([]string{dir}))
}
```

Use this wrapper throughout the test file. Use `runScript` directly only when you need different or
no `AllowedPaths` (e.g. for access-denied tests).

Tests should be written to the following specifications:

- All implemented flags are exercised in at least one test
- Review RULES.md and write tests verifying that the rules are honored where possible, checking for runaway memory allocations, infinite loops / hangs, etc
- Use `os.DevNull` instead of hardcoded `/dev/null` so tests compile on all platforms
- For tests that are inherently platform-specific (symlinks, Windows reserved names, directory reads), create separate files with build tags:
  - `builtin_$ARGUMENTS_unix_test.go` with `//go:build unix` at the top
  - `builtin_$ARGUMENTS_windows_test.go` with `//go:build windows` at the top
- When writing tests that pipe through another builtin (e.g. `cat file | $ARGUMENTS`), account for that builtin's output behaviour. For example, the `cat` builtin uses `fmt.Fprintln` which adds a trailing `\n` to each line — a binary file piped through `cat` will have a `\n` appended that was not in the original file.
- Do **not** use `echo -n` — the `echo` builtin does not support the `-n` flag and will emit the literal string `-n ` instead of suppressing the newline. For empty or newline-free stdin, write an empty file via `setup.files` in a YAML scenario or create a temp file in the test setup.

Verify the tests build and all fail (since we have no implementation yet).

### GNU equivalence tests

After the main test file is written, also write
`interp/builtin_$ARGUMENTS_gnu_compat_test.go` (`package interp_test`).

These tests assert byte-for-byte output equivalence between our builtin and GNU coreutils for
the cases most sensitive to formatting: line counts, trailing newlines, byte mode, headers,
quiet/verbose flags.

**Capturing reference output**

Run the real GNU tool to collect expected outputs, then embed them as string literals in the
test file. This means the tests run without any GNU tooling present on CI — it is captured
once, reviewed by the author, and committed.

How to get GNU $ARGUMENTS depends on what is available:

- **macOS with Homebrew coreutils** (most common on a developer Mac):
  ```bash
  brew install coreutils          # one-time
  g$ARGUMENTS --version           # verify it is GNU, not BSD
  # then run: g$ARGUMENTS [flags] [file] | cat -A   to see exact bytes
  ```
- **Docker** (works everywhere, guaranteed to be Linux GNU coreutils):
  ```bash
  echo "alpha\nbeta\ngamma" > /tmp/testfile.txt
  docker run --rm -v /tmp:/tmp alpine sh -c \
    'apk add -q coreutils && $ARGUMENTS -n 3 /tmp/testfile.txt | cat -A'
  ```

Use `cat -A` (or `cat -v`) while capturing to make invisible characters (CR, trailing spaces)
visible before you write them into the test file.

**What to cover**

At minimum, write one test per formatting-sensitive scenario:

| Scenario | Why it matters |
|----------|----------------|
| Default output on a file longer than the default limit | verifies the off-by-one on the ring/count boundary |
| `-n N` smaller than file length | basic count accuracy |
| `-n 0` | degenerate case: no output |
| `-n N` larger than file length | should not truncate |
| `+N` offset mode (`-n +2`) | completely different code path |
| Long-form flag (`--lines=N`) | pflag alias wiring |
| No trailing newline preserved | should not add a `\n` |
| Empty file | no output, no crash |
| `-v` single file | header printed |
| Two files, default | header + blank-line separator format |
| `-q` / `--quiet` two files | no headers |
| `--silent` two files | alias for `--quiet` |
| `-c N` byte mode | different output path than line mode |
| `-c +N` byte offset | byte version of offset mode |
| Both `-c` and `-n` given | last flag wins (`-n` overrides `-c`) |
| Rejected flag (e.g. `-f`) | exit 1 + non-empty stderr |

**Test structure**

Keep each test self-contained: create temp files with the exact content used for the GNU
reference run, invoke the builtin, and `assert.Equal` the captured string:

```go
// TestGNUCompatCmdVerboseSingleFile — -v prints header even for a single file.
//
// GNU command: g$ARGUMENTS -v one.txt   (one.txt = "only one line\n")
// Expected: "==> one.txt <==\nonly one line\n"
func TestGNUCompatCmdVerboseSingleFile(t *testing.T) {
    dir := setupCmdDir(t, map[string]string{"one.txt": "only one line\n"})
    stdout, _, exitCode := cmdRun(t, "$ARGUMENTS -v one.txt", dir)
    assert.Equal(t, 0, exitCode)
    assert.Equal(t, "==> one.txt <==\nonly one line\n", stdout)
}
```

Include a comment on each test identifying the exact GNU invocation and its raw output so a
future maintainer can reproduce and update the reference without running the real tool from
scratch.

## Step 5: Implement the $ARGUMENTS command

**PARALLEL STEP**: This runs concurrently with Steps 3 and 4. No gate check needed — Step 2 being `completed` is sufficient.

Create `interp/builtins/$ARGUMENTS.go` (`package builtins`) following the patterns in
the existing builtins (e.g. `cat.go`):

1. **Function signature**: `func builtin$ARGUMENTS(ctx context.Context, callCtx *CallContext, args []string) Result`. All builtins take `ctx` — check `ctx.Err()` before every read in any loop.
2. **I/O**: Write output via `callCtx.Out(s)` / `callCtx.Outf(format, ...)` and errors via `callCtx.Errf(format, ...)`. Do not use `os.Stdout`/`os.Stderr` directly.
3. **File access**: Open files via `callCtx.OpenFile(ctx, path, os.O_RDONLY, 0)` — never `os.Open()`. This enforces the allowed-paths sandbox automatically.
4. **Return values**: Return `Result{}` for success and `Result{Code: 1}` for failure. Do not panic or return Go errors for user-facing failures.
5. **Flag parsing**: Use pflag. Any unregistered flag is automatically rejected. Register `-h`/`--help` and handle it per RULES.md. For string flags that may receive an empty value or a special prefix (e.g. `+N` offset syntax), detect whether the flag was explicitly provided using `fs.Changed("flagname")` rather than comparing the value to `""`. Using `*flagStr != ""` is wrong in these cases — an explicit `cmd -n ""` would silently fall through to the default instead of being rejected.
6. **Bounded reads**: Cap all buffer allocations; never allocate based on unclamped user input.
7. **Description**: Every new command must set the `Description` field on its `builtins.Command` struct with a short one-line description (e.g. `Description: "concatenate and print files"`).

Register the command in `interp/builtins/builtins.go`:
- Add an entry to the `registry` map: `"$ARGUMENTS": builtin$ARGUMENTS`

**Update the import allowlist.** `tests/import_allowlist_test.go` enforces a symbol-level allowlist for all builtin implementation files. If your implementation uses any package symbols not already listed in `builtinAllowedSymbols`, add them — one entry per symbol in `"importpath.Symbol"` form. Every addition must comply with RULES.md: do not add any symbol that writes to the filesystem, executes binaries, or otherwise violates the safety rules (e.g. `os.Create`, `os.OpenFile` with write flags, `exec.Command`, `os.Remove`). Read-only `os` constants and types (e.g. `os.O_RDONLY`, `os.FileMode`) are fine; filesystem-accessing functions are not.

**Do not modify any other existing files** unless directly required by the registration or allowlist steps above.

## Step 6: Verify and Harden

**GATE CHECK**: Call TaskList. Steps 3, 4, AND 5 must all be `completed` before starting this step. Set this step to `in_progress` now.

Run the tests:

```bash
go test ./interp/... ./tests/...
```

Fix any failures before finishing.

After the initial test suite is passing, write another round of tests focused on:

- 100% code coverage of the implementation
- Additional tests specific to the rules in RULES.md. For example, if the implementation passes user input into buffer allocations, ensure in tests that this input is clamped to an appropriate value and not passed as-is to the buffer.

## Step 7: Code review

**GATE CHECK**: Call TaskList. Step 6 must be `completed` before starting this step. Set this step to `in_progress` now.

Run two review passes in parallel, then fix every finding before finishing.

### Part A: RULES.md compliance

Spawn parallel review agents — one per section of RULES.md — to audit the final implementation and test suite against every rule:

- Memory Safety & Resource Limits + DoS Prevention + Special File Handling
- Input Validation & Error Handling + Integer Safety
- Cross-Platform Compatibility + Output Consistency
- Testing Requirements (verify every rule has corresponding test coverage)

### Part B: General Go code quality

Review the implementation for standard Go best practices:

- **Error handling**: every `io.Writer.Write`, `io.Copy`, and `fmt.Fprintf` to a writer must have its error checked or explicitly discarded with `_`
- **Context cancellation**: `ctx.Err()` must be checked at the top of every loop that reads input — including scanner loops, not just explicit `Read` calls
- **Resource cleanup**: `defer` must be used to close files and other resources; when a file is opened inside a loop, use an IIFE (`func() error { defer f.Close(); ... }()`) to scope the defer to the loop iteration rather than the function
- **DRY**: functions that differ only in variable names or error strings must be merged; use a `kind string` parameter for error messages
- **Sentinel values**: `-1` or other magic sentinel ints used to select between modes should be replaced by a named `type … int` with named constants
- **Redundant conditionals**: simplify boolean expressions to the minimum necessary branches (e.g. `(a || b) && !c` instead of `(a && !c) || b` followed by `if c { … = false }`)
- **Variable re-derivation**: the same logical value must not be encoded twice in different types (e.g. both a `byte` and a `string` for the line separator)
- **Test helpers**: a test must not run the same command twice just to observe different aspects; consolidate into a single runner that captures both stdout/stderr and exit code

For each issue found in either review, fix it immediately. Re-run tests after all fixes.

### Second-pass review

After all findings from Parts A and B are fixed and tests are green, do a second independent review pass. Re-read the implementation file from the top as if you have never seen it before — do not reference the previous review findings. Look for:

- Anything the first pass missed because it was obscured by the issues that were just fixed
- New problems introduced by the fixes themselves (e.g., a simplification that quietly dropped a nil check or error return)
- Any logic that is now clearly wrong with the cleaned-up code as context

Fix any new findings and re-run tests. Only then declare Step 7 complete.

## Step 8: Exploratory pentest

**GATE CHECK**: Call TaskList. Step 7 must be `completed` before starting this step. Set this step to `in_progress` now.

Perform all pentest exercises as Go tests in a dedicated file:

`interp/builtin_$ARGUMENTS_pentest_test.go` (`package interp_test`)

Use the command-specific wrapper (e.g. `cmdRun`) or `runScript` directly. Use `context.WithTimeout` on individual tests to catch hangs:

```go
func TestCmdPentestInfiniteSource(t *testing.T) {
    dir := t.TempDir()
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
    defer cancel()
    // exercise the command ...
}
```

Run with `go test ./interp/... -run TestCmdPentest -timeout 120s`. For any surprising result, check whether GNU coreutils behaves the same way before deciding whether to fix it — surprising-but-matching-GNU is documenting a known behaviour, not a bug.

### Integer edge cases
- `-n 0`, `-n 1`, `-n MaxInt32`, `-n MaxInt64`, `-n MaxInt64+1`, `-n 99999999999999999999`
- `-n -1`, `-n -9999999999` (should reject)
- `-n +0`, `-n +1`, `-n +MaxInt64`
- `-n ''`, `-n '   '` (empty / whitespace)
- Same set for `-c`

### Special files / infinite sources
- Command in default line mode on `/dev/zero`, `/dev/random` — note whether it errors fast or spins
- Same in `-c` (byte) mode — compare timing against `gtail` to confirm matching behaviour
- `/dev/null` (empty source), `/proc` or `/sys` files if on Linux

### Long lines
- Line of `maxLineBytes - 1` bytes (should succeed)
- Line of exactly `maxLineBytes` bytes (documents where the cap actually bites)
- Line of `maxLineBytes + 1` bytes (should fail)
- Two lines each near the cap; verify last-line selection is correct

### Memory / resource exhaustion
- `-n MaxInt32` on a small file (verifies clamping, not OOM)
- `-c MaxInt32` on a small file
- 200+ file arguments (verifies no FD leak)
- 1M-line file through last-N and +N offset modes (verifies ring buffer correctness at scale)

### Path and filename edge cases
- Absolute path, `../` traversal, `//double//slashes`, `/etc/././hosts`
- Non-existent file, directory as file, empty-string filename
- Filename starting with `-` (use `--` separator)
- Symlink to a regular file, dangling symlink, circular symlink
- Symlink to `/dev/zero` (same DoS check as direct special file)

### Flag and argument injection
- Unknown flags (`-f`, `--follow`, `--no-such-flag`): confirm exit 1 + stderr, not fatal error
- Flag value via word expansion: `for flag in -f; do cmd $flag file; done`
- `--` end-of-flags followed by flag-like filenames
- Multiple `-` (stdin) arguments

### Behavior matching
For any case where behaviour differs from expectation, run the equivalent `gtail` invocation and compare. Differences fall into three categories:
1. **Matches GNU** — document in a code comment, no code change needed
2. **Safer than GNU** — document; generally keep our behaviour
3. **Worse than GNU** — fix it

## Step 9: Write fuzz tests

**GATE CHECK**: Call TaskList. Step 8 must be `completed` before starting this step. Set this step to `in_progress` now.

Create `interp/builtins/tests/$ARGUMENTS/$ARGUMENTS_fuzz_test.go` (`package $ARGUMENTS_test`).

Fuzz tests run seed corpus entries as normal tests (without `-fuzz=`), making them free to run in CI. Their job is to verify that the implementation never panics, crashes, or returns unexpected exit codes across a wide variety of inputs. Exit codes 0 and 1 are always acceptable; exit code 2 (usage error) is acceptable for commands that use it (e.g. `test`); any other code or a panic is a failure.

### Structure

Each `Fuzz*` function follows this pattern:

```go
func FuzzCmdSomething(f *testing.F) {
    // Seed corpus entries — each f.Add() is a test case run in non-fuzz mode
    f.Add([]byte("normal input\n"))
    f.Add([]byte{})
    // ... more seeds ...

    f.Fuzz(func(t *testing.T, input []byte /* + any extra args */) {
        if len(input) > 1<<20 { return } // cap at 1 MiB
        // filter out inputs that would cause shell parse errors
        // create temp dir, write input file
        // run the command with a 5-second timeout
        ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
        defer cancel()
        _, _, code := cmdRunCtxFuzz(ctx, t, "...", dir)
        if code != 0 && code != 1 {
            t.Errorf("unexpected exit code %d", code)
        }
    })
}
```

Define `cmdRunCtxFuzz` (not `cmdRunCtx`, to avoid redeclaration conflicts with any existing test file in the package) at the top of the fuzz test file:

```go
func cmdRunCtxFuzz(ctx context.Context, t *testing.T, script, dir string) (string, string, int) {
    t.Helper()
    return testutil.RunScriptCtx(ctx, t, script, dir, interp.AllowedPaths([]string{dir}))
}
```

Write one `Fuzz*` function per distinct mode of the command (e.g. `FuzzCmdLines`, `FuzzCmdBytes`, `FuzzCmdStdin`, `FuzzCmdFlags`). For commands with multiple flags, write one fuzz function per mode rather than jamming all flags into a single function — this keeps the seed corpus focused and makes failures easier to reproduce.

### Seed corpus sources

Build the seed corpus from **all three** of these sources. Do not skip any source — each catches different classes of bugs.

**Source A: Implementation edge cases.** Read `interp/builtins/$ARGUMENTS.go` and identify every named constant, boundary check, special case, and clamp. Each one needs at least one seed:
- Memory safety constants (e.g. `MaxLineBytes = 1 << 20`, `maxStringLen = 1 << 20`)
- Counter/allocation clamps (e.g. `MaxCount = 1<<31-1`)
- Buffer sizes and chunk boundaries (e.g. scanner init=4096, read chunks=32KiB)
- Input encoding edge cases the implementation handles (CRLF, null bytes, invalid UTF-8, bare CR)
- Boundary values: exactly at a limit, one below, one above
- Degenerate inputs: empty, single byte, no trailing newline, all-identical lines, all-unique lines

**Source B: CVE and security history.** Research which CVEs and security issues have affected the GNU implementation of `$ARGUMENTS` (and related tools like binutils for `strings`). For each vulnerability, add a seed that exercises the same class of input — even though our implementation may not share the same code path, these are the inputs real attackers will try:
- Integer overflow inputs (very large `-n`/`-c` values: `MaxInt32`, `MaxInt64`, `MaxInt64+1`, `UINT64_MAX`)
- Long-line inputs near and past historical buffer limits (4KB, 64KB, 1 MiB)
- Null bytes embedded in content (triggered stack overflows in distro-patched versions of `uniq`, `sort`, `join`)
- CRLF line endings (many CVEs involve incorrect line-ending handling)
- Invalid UTF-8 sequences (surrogates, overlong encodings, bare continuation bytes)
- Binary format magic bytes (ELF `\x7fELF`, PE `MZ`, ZIP `PK\x03\x04`) for commands that process file content
- ANSI/terminal escape sequences in content (for commands that output filenames or text to a terminal)
- ReDoS-class regex patterns for `grep` (e.g. `(a+)+`, `a*a*b`, `([a-z]+)*`)

**Source C: Existing test coverage.** Read through `interp/builtins/tests/$ARGUMENTS/$ARGUMENTS_test.go` and `tests/scenarios/cmd/$ARGUMENTS/`. Every distinct input value, file content, or flag combination that appears in those tests should also appear as a seed corpus entry. This ensures that known-good cases are always in the fuzz corpus baseline, and that regressions found by the unit tests cannot escape fuzz coverage.

### Verify

Run all fuzz seed tests before committing:

```bash
go test ./interp/builtins/tests/$ARGUMENTS/ -run 'Fuzz' -count=1
```

All seeds must pass. Also run gofmt:

```bash
gofmt -l interp/builtins/tests/$ARGUMENTS/
```

No output means clean. Fix any formatting issues with `gofmt -w`.

### CI integration

Add an entry for the new fuzz package to `.github/workflows/fuzz.yml` under the `matrix.package` list so the fuzzer runs in CI:

```yaml
- package: interp/builtins/tests/$ARGUMENTS
  fuzz: Fuzz$ARGUMENTS  # use the most broadly applicable fuzz function
```

## Step 10: Update documentation

**GATE CHECK**: Call TaskList. Step 9 must be `completed` before starting this step. Set this step to `in_progress` now.

Verify that `SHELL_FEATURES.md` in the repository root does not need updates (e.g. if a new category of feature is added).

Verify that `help` lists the new command with the correct description by running `go run ./cmd/rshell --allow-all-commands -c 'help'`.

After updating, verify the file looks correct, then commit everything together if not already committed, or amend/add to the existing commit.
