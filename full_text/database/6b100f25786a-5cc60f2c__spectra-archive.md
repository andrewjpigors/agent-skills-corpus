Archive a completed change.

> **Ownership**（clade fork；cross-phase matrix in `rules/core/spectra-workflow.md`）：archive gate-check 負責 archive 前再跑 Layer C data-sanity + `archive-gate.sh` Check 1–7（journey / schema-types / exhaustiveness / manual-review kind / screenshot quality / stale verified-ui / pre-handoff-verdict）。**不**負責上游 phase 已 own 的 checkpoint（propose Layer A、apply Step 6c/Layer B、pre-handoff Step 8a.6/Layer E 各在自己 phase 抓）；Check 7 只是機械驗證 Step 8a.6 的 E.1 verdict record 已存在（缺則擋 archive），不重跑 self-analysis 本身。

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name after `/spectra-archive` (e.g., `/spectra-archive add-auth`). If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Prerequisites**: This skill requires the `spectra` CLI. If any `spectra` command fails with "command not found" or similar, report the error and STOP.

## Change Disposition Decision (clade fork addition)

Before running archive, classify the change into one of four dispositions. Pick the wrong path and you either (a) burn user time on a review that doesn't apply, (b) write spec for a feature that won't ship, or (c) abandon work that's actually still pending.

| Disposition | Trigger | spec sync | manual review | CLI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Park** | Change is **postponed but still planned**. Premise still valid. | — | — | `spectra park <name>` (NOT this skill) |
| **Standard archive** | Implementation `[x]` complete + `## 人工檢查` `[x]` complete | applied | already done | `spectra archive <name>` (default flow) |
| **Skip-archive (A)** | **Won't be implemented.** Premise dissolved (decision changed / concept removed / change became redundant). | **skipped** | **skipped** | `spectra archive <name> --mark-tasks-complete --skip-specs --no-validate -y` |
| **In-main-done archive (B)** | Implementation `[x]` complete (built directly on main, no session worktree). Only `## 人工檢查` items remain unchecked. | applied | **skipped** | `spectra archive <name> --mark-tasks-complete --no-validate -y` |
| **Apply-required (block)** | Non-`## 人工檢查` items still `[ ]` + change is still wanted. | — | — | **STOP** — run `/spectra-apply <name>` first, then re-classify |

### Hard rules

- **NEVER** use Park for "won't implement" — Park's contract is "future work pending"; abandoned changes pollute the parked queue and look like a backlog. Use Skip-archive (A) instead.
- **NEVER** use Skip-archive (A) when implementation work is actually done — that drops the spec delta and leaves the codebase with shipped behavior that has no spec record. Use In-main-done archive (B) instead.
- **NEVER** run In-main-done archive (B) without first verifying that non-`## 人工檢查` task sections are fully `[x]`. Use the inspection check below.
- **NEVER** auto-batch multiple changes into Skip-archive (A) without per-change user confirmation — abandoning work is destructive (spec delta thrown away, future readers lose the why).
- **MUST** record the disposition reason (1 line) in the archive commit message when using Skip-archive (A) or In-main-done archive (B), so future readers can tell why standard flow was bypassed:
  - A: `archive: <name>; skip — <reason premise dissolved>`
  - B: `archive: <name>; in-main-done — <reason no worktree, e.g. built directly on main>`

### Inspection check (before B vs Apply-required)

To distinguish In-main-done archive (B) from Apply-required, parse `openspec/changes/<name>/tasks.md`:

```bash
awk '/^## 人工檢查/{mr=1; next} /^## /{mr=0} !mr && /^- \[ \]/{print NR": "$0}' \
  openspec/changes/<name>/tasks.md
```

- **Empty output** → all non-manual-review items are `[x]` → eligible for In-main-done archive (B)
- **Non-empty output** → there are unchecked implementation tasks → MUST be either:
  1. **Apply-required**: run `/spectra-apply <name>` to finish them, then re-classify
  2. **Skip-archive (A)**: explicit user confirmation that the unchecked work won't be done (premise dissolved)
  - **NEVER** silently auto-`--mark-tasks-complete` non-manual-review tasks without classifying — that hides incomplete implementation behind a green archive.

### Worktree handling per disposition

- **Skip-archive (A)**: change has no implementation to land. If a session worktree exists (typically with only ingest / sync commits, no real implementation), run `node scripts/wt-helper.mjs cleanup <name> --force --force-discard-unland` to drop branch + worktree; do **NOT** run `merge-back` (nothing meaningful to merge).
- **In-main-done archive (B)**: change was built on main, no worktree to absorb. Step 0 `wt-helper merge-back ... --noop-if-missing` becomes silent no-op — proceed.
- **Standard archive**: Step 0 absorbs the matching worktree as documented below.

### When user asks for "skip 人工檢查 and archive"

"Skip 人工檢查 + archive" is ambiguous between A and B. **MUST** disambiguate with the user before running:

- "這條的功能會做嗎？" → No → A
- "已經在 main 做完了，只是沒走 worktree？" → Yes → B (after passing the Inspection check)
- Both ambiguous → walk through Inspection check output with the user, then pick.

**Worktree exemption (clade fork addition)**: This skill is exempt from the [[worktree-default]] §1 worktree requirement. Archive is main-bound — every output (delta sync into `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`, move into `openspec/changes/archive/`, screenshot sweep) targets main, so running inside a worktree adds a mandatory merge-back with no isolation benefit. The skill SHALL proceed regardless of whether cwd is on the main worktree or inside a session worktree; the orchestrator (e.g., `/handoff` Mode B Step 2B.5) SHALL dispatch this skill directly without routing through `/wt`. Do NOT add prose instructing the user to "open a worktree first" — that contradicts the §1 exemption.

**Atomic merge-back contract (clade fork addition)**: Per [[worktree-default]] §5.5, worktree branches do NOT squash back to main at `/wt` return time — they wait until archive. Step 0 below absorbs any slug-matching session worktree into main BEFORE the archive gates run, so gates inspect the post-squash state and so main never carries half-done work between sessions.

**Steps**

0. **Atomic merge-back from active worktree** (clade fork addition)

   Per [[worktree-default]] §5.5, any session worktree whose slug matches this change-name MUST be absorbed into main before archive gates run. If gates run on un-absorbed main, they would see a false-clean diff (worktree changes never landed) and produce a misleading archive.

   **Sidecar init (TD-155)** — before running merge-back, create the in-flight sidecar so that subsequent steps record progress and an interrupted run leaves a detectable orphan:

   ```bash
   node scripts/spectra-archive-sidecar.mjs init <change-name>
   ```

   - Sidecar is always written to main worktree `.spectra/in-flight-archive/<change-name>.json` (helper resolves via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`), so a linked worktree's archive is visible from main on the next session start (cross-session detection per `plugins/hub-core/hooks/session-start-spectra-resume-check.sh`).
   - If `scripts/spectra-archive-sidecar.mjs` does not exist (consumer pre-propagation), skip silently with a one-line note: `Sidecar: skipped — helper not available (consumer pre-propagate)`.
   - **Skip in resume mode**: when Step 0.5 has dispatched into mid-flight resume (sidecar already exists with `phase=merge-back`), do NOT re-init — proceed directly to the merge-back command below.

   ```bash
   node scripts/wt-helper.mjs merge-back <change-name> --auto-stash --noop-if-missing
   ```

   - `--noop-if-missing` makes this a silent no-op when no matching worktree exists (solo archive path — change implemented directly on main).
   - `--auto-stash` stashes any main-worktree blockers as `wt-merge-block/<change-name>/<ISO>` for later reconciliation via `node scripts/stash-reconcile.mjs`.
   - On conflict, the squash aborts, the worktree + branch are preserved, and the stash is popped back. Surface the error and **STOP** the archive — the change cannot be archived until the conflict is resolved.

   **Skip condition**: if `scripts/wt-helper.mjs` does not exist (consumer hasn't propagated the merge-back subcommand yet), skip this step silently with a one-line note: `Step 0: skipped — wt-helper merge-back not available (consumer pre-propagate)`.

   After merge-back, sweep sibling worktrees that carry fork-time stale copies of the change being archived (prevents spectra CLI cross-worktree existence check from refusing):

   ```bash
   node scripts/wt-helper.mjs sweep-siblings <change-name>
   ```

   **Sidecar advance (TD-155)** — after merge-back returns (whether absorbed, no-op, or skipped), advance phase:

   ```bash
   node scripts/spectra-archive-sidecar.mjs update <change-name> --phase gate-check --last-completed merge-back
   ```

   (silent fail-safe: if sidecar helper or sidecar file is missing, ignore — sidecar lifecycle is best-effort visibility, not a hard dependency of archive correctness.)

   **Output (when worktree absorbed)**:
   - `merge-back: <change-name> absorbed into main` — proceed to Step 1
   - `merge-back: <change-name> absorbed into main (blockers stashed as wt-merge-block/<name>/<ISO>) + worktree cleaned` — proceed; remind user in Step 8 summary that stash entry needs reconciliation

0.5. **Resume / mid-flight detection** (clade fork addition — fires only when explicit change-name given)

   Two independent resume paths share this step:
   - **Mid-flight resume (TD-155)** — fires when an in-flight sidecar exists from an interrupted prior run
   - **Discuss-deferred resume (legacy)** — fires when archive was completed but discuss items were deferred to HANDOFF

   ### Mid-flight resume (TD-155)

   Before anything else, check for an in-flight sidecar:

   ```bash
   node scripts/spectra-archive-sidecar.mjs read <change-name> 2>/dev/null
   ```

   Branch:

   - **Sidecar exists + user invoked `/spectra-archive <X> --resume`** → enter **Mid-flight resume mode**. Parse sidecar's `phase` field and jump per Resume Dispatch Table below. Do NOT re-init the sidecar; do NOT re-run completed phases.
   - **Sidecar exists + user did NOT pass `--resume`** → STOP. Prompt the user:
     > Previous /spectra-archive for `<X>` interrupted at phase `<phase>` (sidecar started `<ISO>`). Options:
     >  a) Resume — re-run as `/spectra-archive <X> --resume`
     >  b) Discard previous run and start fresh — `node scripts/spectra-archive-sidecar.mjs delete <X>` then re-invoke without `--resume`
     >
     > Choose a / b. Standard archive cannot proceed while a sidecar exists.
   - **No sidecar** → fall through to discuss-deferred resume detection below.

   #### Resume Dispatch Table (mid-flight)

   Read sidecar via `node scripts/spectra-archive-sidecar.mjs read <change-name>` (parse JSON `.phase`):

   | `phase` value | Action on `--resume` |
   | --- | --- |
   | `merge-back` | re-run **Step 0** from the top. `wt-helper merge-back --noop-if-missing` is idempotent — if the worktree was already absorbed in the prior run, it silently no-ops. |
   | `gate-check` | jump to **Step 2** and re-run gates (2 / 3 / 3.3 / 3.5 / 5.5). All gates are idempotent: status / task / pattern checks are read-only; the `[discuss]` walkthrough in Step 3.5 only re-prompts items still unchecked. |
   | `spec-sync` | jump to **Step 4** and re-run delta spec assessment. Comparison is idempotent. |
   | `folder-mv` | **STOP — manual fixup required**. Reason: Step 6 invokes `spectra archive` CLI which is a black box from clade's POV; mid-flight interrupt may leave `openspec/changes/<X>/` partially renamed and `openspec/specs/<cap>/spec.md` deltas partially applied. Show the user: <br/> *"phase=folder-mv means `spectra archive` CLI was mid-flight when interrupted. Cannot safely retry — reality is unknown. Manual fixup: (a) inspect `openspec/changes/<X>/` and `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<X>/` directory states; (b) inspect `git status` for partial spec delta writes; (c) reconcile by hand (either complete the move or roll back), then `node scripts/spectra-archive-sidecar.mjs delete <X>` and re-invoke from a clean state."* |
   | `screenshot-sweep` | jump to **Step 7** and re-run screenshot sweep. `screenshots-archive` Mode B is idempotent on re-copy (existing destination files are silently kept). |
   | `cleanup` | jump to **Step 7.5** and re-run stash reconcile + Step 8 summary. Both are near no-ops on re-run. |

   ### Discuss-deferred resume (legacy)

   When **no sidecar** exists, also check the legacy discuss-deferred path:

   ```bash
   if [ ! -d "openspec/changes/<change-name>" ] && [ -d "openspec/changes/archive/<change-name>" ]; then
     if grep -q '(deferred-to-handoff:' "openspec/changes/archive/<change-name>/tasks.md" 2>/dev/null; then
       # Discuss-deferred resume candidate
       ...
     fi
   fi
   ```

   - **No active dir + no archived dir + no sidecar** → STOP with error: "change `<name>` not found in active or archived"
   - **No active dir + archived dir but no `(deferred-to-handoff:` annotation** → STOP with note: "change `<name>` already fully archived; nothing to resume"
   - **No active dir + archived dir with `(deferred-to-handoff:` annotations** → enter **Discuss-deferred resume mode**: skip Step 0 (merge-back), skip Step 1 (selection prompt), skip Steps 2 / 3 / 3.3 / 3.5 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 / 8 entirely. Jump to **Step 3.5b — Resume walkthrough** below; that step is the only work performed in this resume path.

   Standard archive runs (active change directory exists + no sidecar) **MUST NOT** trigger discuss-deferred resume even if a homonymous archived change has deferred items.

   **Skip Step 0.5 entirely** when no change-name was provided (Step 1 still handles selection from active changes).

1. **If no change name provided, prompt for selection**

   Run `spectra list --json` to get available changes. Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select.

   Show only active changes (not already archived).
   Include the schema used for each change if available.

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT guess or auto-select a change. Always let the user choose.

2. **Check artifact completion status**

   Run `spectra status --change "<name>" --json` to check artifact completion.

   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow being used
   - `artifacts`: List of artifacts with their status (`done` or other)

   **If any artifacts are not `done`:**
   - Display warning listing incomplete artifacts
   - Prompt user for confirmation to continue
   - Proceed if user confirms

3. **Check task completion status**

   Read the tasks file (typically `tasks.md`) to check for incomplete tasks.

   Count **leaf** tasks marked with `- [ ]` (incomplete) vs `- [x]` (complete). For `## 人工檢查` items, parent `#N` lines that own scoped `#N.M` children have state derived from children (see `rules/core/manual-review.md`「Parent State Derivation」) — never count those parent lines directly.

   **If incomplete tasks found:**
   - Display warning showing count of incomplete tasks
   - Prompt user for confirmation to continue
   - Proceed if user confirms

   **If no tasks file exists:** Proceed without task-related warning.

3.3. **Manual-Review Pattern Re-check** (clade fork addition — archive gate for `## 人工檢查` hygiene)

   `## 人工檢查` items can drift between propose / ingest and archive (apply phase edits, screenshot annotations, fix-up rewrites). Re-run the same enforcement hook that `/spectra-propose` uses, so jargon leakage / abstract reference / missing URL etc. doesn't slip into archive:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/spectra-advanced/post-propose-manual-review-check.sh <change-name>
   ```

   Exit 2 = pattern findings (any of `ABSTRACT_REFERENCE` / `CARD_WITHOUT_UID` / `UI_ITEM_NO_URL` / `MULTI_STEP_NOT_SCOPED` / `REVIEW_UI_BACKEND_ROUNDTRIP` / `INTERNAL_JARGON_LEAKAGE`).

   **If findings exist:**
   - Display warning showing pattern hit summary (parsed from hook stderr)
   - Prompt user: "Archive 前 manual-review 還有 N 個 pattern 命中（見上）— 修完再 archive vs 帶 followup 跳過？"
     - **Fix now** → main thread Edit `tasks.md` per hook remediation guidance; re-run hook; loop until clean
     - **Bypass with @followup** → user adds `@followup[TD-NNN]` to each hit item + opens consumer-side TD; main thread re-runs hook to confirm bypass markers recognized; proceed
     - **Bypass with @no-manual-review-check** → only if hit is legitimate false positive (e.g., 真機掃 SMS 無 dev replay endpoint); main thread adds marker + re-runs hook; proceed
   - Proceed only after hook exits 0 or user explicitly confirms bypass strategy

   **If hook exits 0:** Silent skip — proceed to Step 3.5.

   Reference: `vendor/snippets/manual-review-enforcement/patterns.json` + `rules/core/manual-review.data-readiness.md`.

3.5. **Discuss Items Walkthrough** (Step 2.5 in the spec — runs after artifact + task completion checks, before delta sync preview)

   Spec authority: `openspec/specs/manual-review-item-kind/spec.md` "Spectra-Archive Discuss Walkthrough"

   Read `openspec/changes/<change-name>/tasks.md` `## 人工檢查` section. Identify every unchecked item where `kind = "discuss"` (either explicit `[discuss]` marker, OR derived via Default Kind Derivation Rule when proposal.md contains `**No user-facing journey (backend-only)**`).

   **For each unchecked `[discuss]` item, the main thread Claude SHALL** (proactively, without prompting):

   1. Read the item description and surrounding context (proposal.md User Journeys, related task results, recent diff).
   2. **Classify the item's trigger condition** (key for next step):
      - **Internal evidence available now** — code / schema / migration state / cron config / dev DB query result. Claude can collect evidence immediately.
      - **External signal already occurred** — staging / production already deployed, soak window already elapsed, business decision already made. Claude can query the post-signal state (prod URL `<title>`, prod evlog row, prod migration `\d` output) and collect evidence.
      - **External signal pending** — required deploy / soak / business authorization has **not yet** occurred. Claude **CANNOT** synthesize evidence by analysis alone; any "based on code, this should work" reasoning is speculation, not walkthrough evidence.
   3. **Prepare evidence** relevant to the item — pick whichever combination is most informative:
      - `grep` / `rg` results showing the relevant code paths or migrations touched
      - Recent `git diff` excerpts (focused on the area the item references)
      - Command output (if the item asks about deploy / migration / cron / data state, run the relevant query and paste the output)
      - Data summary (e.g., row counts, distribution stats, drift counts)
      - Cross-consumer / cross-environment check results (e.g., per-consumer migration apply status)

      **For "External signal pending" items**: skip evidence collection (there's nothing to collect yet). Move directly to step 4 with the trigger condition stated explicitly.
   4. Present to the user, in this format:

      ```
      ### Discuss item #<id> [discuss] <description>

      **Trigger condition:** <internal evidence | external signal already occurred | external signal pending — describe>

      **Evidence:** (omit this section if trigger is "external signal pending")
      <grep / diff / command output / summary>

      **My read:** <one or two sentences explaining what the evidence implies, OR "waiting on <signal>; no evidence available yet — recommend Defer to HANDOFF so archive can proceed">

      請確認：OK / Issue / Skip[ / Defer]
      ```

      The **Defer** option is shown **only** when trigger is "external signal pending". For the other two trigger classes, only OK / Issue / Skip are valid — Claude has evidence available and there is nothing legitimate to wait on.

   5. Wait for the user's response. Branch on the answer:

      - **OK**: Edit `tasks.md` for this line:
        - Set checkbox to `[x]`
        - Insert `(claude-discussed: <ISO-8601-timestamp>)` annotation between description and any trailing markers (`@followup[TD-NNN]` / `@no-screenshot`), preserving canonical ordering. Use the current ISO-8601 UTC timestamp (`new Date().toISOString()`).
        - Example before: `- [ ] #2 [discuss] Confirm rollout @no-screenshot`
        - Example after: `- [x] #2 [discuss] Confirm rollout (claude-discussed: 2026-05-10T14:23:00Z) @no-screenshot`
      - **Issue**: Edit `tasks.md`:
        - Keep checkbox as `[ ]`
        - Append `（issue: <user note>）` annotation between description and trailing markers
        - Note in summary: this item is intentionally left unchecked; archive **does NOT** block on it (user retains control)
      - **Skip**: Edit `tasks.md`:
        - Set checkbox to `[x]`
        - Append `（skip）` annotation (or `（skip: <reason>）` if the user gave a reason)
      - **Defer** (only valid when trigger is "external signal pending"): Edit `tasks.md`:
        - Set checkbox to `[x]`
        - Insert `(deferred-to-handoff: <ISO-8601-timestamp>) (awaiting-signal: <signal-desc>)` between description and trailing markers (canonical ordering: kind marker → annotations → `@followup` / `@no-screenshot`)
        - Example after: `- [x] #2 [discuss] Confirm rollout (deferred-to-handoff: 2026-05-22T03:14:00Z) (awaiting-signal: prod deploy) @no-screenshot`
        - **AND** write a HANDOFF entry (see "HANDOFF write" subsection below). Archive flow **continues** — do NOT stop.

   6. Move to the next unchecked `[discuss]` item until all are processed.

   **HANDOFF write** (only fires when at least one item took the Defer path in this archive run):

   - Resolve target path: `$MAIN_WT_PATH/HANDOFF.md` (use `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir` to find the main worktree even from a linked worktree; same idiom as `handoff` skill Step 1.5).
   - Locate `## Deferred discuss items` heading. If missing, append the heading + an empty body at the end of HANDOFF.md.
   - For each deferred item, append an entry block (preserving any pre-existing entries in deferred-at ascending order):

     ```md
     <!-- deferred-begin:<change-name>:<item-id> -->
     - **<change-name>** #<item-id> — <one-line description copied from tasks.md, stripped of kind marker and annotations>
       - Awaiting signal: <signal-desc same as awaiting-signal annotation>
       - Resume: `/spectra-archive <change-name>`
       - Deferred at: <ISO-8601-timestamp same as deferred-to-handoff annotation>
     <!-- deferred-end:<change-name>:<item-id> -->
     ```

   - The HTML markers are load-bearing — Resume mode (Step 1 path resolution) uses them for `sed`-based entry removal. Do **NOT** drop or rename them.

   **Skip-condition**: if `## 人工檢查` has no unchecked `[discuss]` items, skip this step silently.

   **Out of scope here**: unchecked `[review:ui]` items are NOT processed in this step — they are routed to `/review-screenshot` by the orchestrator's Archive Flow (`spectra/SKILL.md` Step 1). If `[review:ui]` items remain unchecked at this point, the orchestrator should already have prompted the user; if they reach Step 6 unchecked, archive-gate.sh Check 4 will block.

   **Restrictions** (hard rules from `manual-review.md`):

   - **NEVER** mark a `[discuss]` item `[x]` without showing the user evidence first AND receiving an explicit OK / Skip / Defer
   - **NEVER** write `(claude-discussed: <ISO>)` annotation without an actual discussion taking place
   - **NEVER** offer the Defer option when trigger is "internal evidence available" or "external signal already occurred" — Defer is reserved for "external signal pending"
   - **NEVER** write `(deferred-to-handoff: <ISO>)` annotation without also writing the matching HANDOFF entry in the same archive run
   - **NEVER** batch-process multiple `[discuss]` items in one user prompt — present them one at a time so the user can give a focused answer per item
   - **NEVER** touch `[review:ui]` items during this step

3.5b. **Resume walkthrough** (clade fork addition — only runs when Step 0.5 detected Resume mode; skip otherwise)

   For each line in `openspec/changes/archive/<change-name>/tasks.md` containing `(deferred-to-handoff:`:

   1. Read item description + extract the `awaiting-signal:` annotation text.
   2. Re-classify trigger condition. The originally-pending signal typically has occurred by now; collect post-signal evidence (prod URL `<title>`, prod evlog row, prod migration `\d` output, etc.). If the signal **still** has not occurred, that's a legitimate "still pending" outcome.
   3. Present to user identical to Step 3.5 walkthrough format, but with header:

      ```
      ### Resume discuss item #<id> [discuss] <description>

      **Originally deferred at:** <ISO from deferred-to-handoff annotation>
      **Awaiting signal:** <signal-desc from awaiting-signal annotation>
      **Trigger condition now:** <internal evidence | external signal already occurred | external signal still pending>

      **Evidence:** (omit if signal still pending)
      <grep / diff / command output / summary>

      **My read:** <one or two sentences>

      請確認：OK / Issue / Skip / Still pending
      ```

      "Defer" is **NOT** offered in Resume mode — that would re-defer the same item indefinitely. The user picks a terminal outcome (OK / Issue / Skip) or signals the item still needs more time (Still pending).

   4. Branch on user response, editing `openspec/changes/archive/<change-name>/tasks.md`:
      - **OK**: Remove `(deferred-to-handoff: ...)` and `(awaiting-signal: ...)` annotations from the line. Insert `(claude-discussed: <new-ISO>)` between description and trailing markers. Keep checkbox `[x]`.
      - **Issue**: Remove `(deferred-to-handoff: ...)` and `(awaiting-signal: ...)`. Change checkbox `[x]` → `[ ]`. Append `（issue: <user note>）` between description and trailing markers.
      - **Skip**: Remove `(deferred-to-handoff: ...)` and `(awaiting-signal: ...)`. Append `（skip[: reason]）`. Keep checkbox `[x]`.
      - **Still pending**: Leave line completely unchanged (annotations + checkbox both stay). HANDOFF entry also stays.

   5. For each item resolved (OK / Issue / Skip) — i.e. NOT "Still pending" — remove the corresponding HANDOFF entry. Resolve `$MAIN_WT_PATH` first (same idiom as `handoff` skill Step 1.5):

      ```bash
      GIT_COMMON_DIR="$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir 2>/dev/null)"
      MAIN_WT_PATH="$(dirname "$GIT_COMMON_DIR")"
      HANDOFF_FILE="$MAIN_WT_PATH/HANDOFF.md"

      # Delete the block between deferred-begin / deferred-end markers for this change/item.
      # Use sed; if markers not found (user manually edited), leave HANDOFF alone and report.
      if grep -q "<!-- deferred-begin:<change-name>:<item-id> -->" "$HANDOFF_FILE"; then
        sed -i.bak "/<!-- deferred-begin:<change-name>:<item-id> -->/,/<!-- deferred-end:<change-name>:<item-id> -->/d" "$HANDOFF_FILE"
        rm "$HANDOFF_FILE.bak"
      else
        echo "warn: HANDOFF entry for <change-name>:<item-id> not found (markers missing); user should clean manually"
      fi
      ```

   6. After all deferred items processed:
      - If `## Deferred discuss items` section body is now empty (no `<!-- deferred-begin:` markers remain anywhere under that heading), best-effort remove the heading too. If removal would risk corrupting surrounding markdown (heading is wedged between other sections), leave heading + empty body and tell user to clean manually.
      - Print one-line summary: `Resume walkthrough complete: X resolved (Y OK / Z Issue / W Skip) / V still pending`

   7. Resume mode does **NOT** run any spectra CLI command. The archived change directory stays in place; only `tasks.md` (and `HANDOFF.md` entries) get edited. User stages + commits the resulting diff manually with a message like `archive: <change-name>; resume — deferred items: X resolved, Y still pending`.

   **Restrictions** (Resume mode):

   - **NEVER** run `spectra archive` CLI in Resume mode (change is already archived — archive flow is a no-op)
   - **NEVER** delete or move the archived change directory
   - **NEVER** re-run gates (archive-gate / manual-review pattern check) / delta sync / screenshot sweep in Resume mode — Step 0.5 explicitly skips those
   - **NEVER** add new `(deferred-to-handoff: ...)` annotations in Resume mode — Defer is forbidden here (would re-defer indefinitely)
   - **NEVER** touch items that lack `(deferred-to-handoff:)` annotation, even in the same `## 人工檢查` section — Resume mode is scoped to deferred items only

4. **Assess delta spec sync state**

   Check for delta specs at `openspec/changes/<name>/specs/`. If none exist, proceed without sync prompt.

   **If delta specs exist:**
   - Compare each delta spec with its corresponding main spec at `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`
   - Determine what changes would be applied (adds, modifications, removals, renames)
   - Show a combined summary before prompting

   **Prompt options:**
   - If changes needed: "Sync now (recommended)", "Archive without syncing"
   - If already synced: "Archive now", "Sync anyway", "Cancel"

   If user chooses sync, use Task tool (subagent_type: "general-purpose", prompt: "Use Skill tool to invoke spectra-sync-specs for change '<name>'. Delta spec analysis: <include the analyzed delta spec summary>"). Proceed to archive regardless of choice.

5. **Clean up tracking file**

   Delete `.spectra/touched/<change-name>.json` if it exists. This file contains implementation tracking data that is not needed after archiving.

   ```bash
   rm -f .spectra/touched/<change-name>.json
   ```

   If the file does not exist, silently continue.

5.5. **Post-walkthrough gate re-check** (clade fork addition — paired with `--pre-skill` PreToolUse hook)

   **Journey URL Touch (Check 1) bypass marker** — if Check 1 reports `Journey URL Touch 未通過` for a URL whose `.vue` was committed in main **before this worktree was forked** (typical: earlier propose iteration impl'd the UI, current worktree only carries verify evidence / tasks.md annotations / screenshot sweep), this is the expected atomic-landing edge case. Drop a bypass marker into the relevant `tasks.md` block:

   ```markdown
   <!-- journey-touch: intentional, reason: UI already committed in <commit-sha> (earlier propose iteration); this worktree only carries verify evidence -->
   ```

   The gate honours the marker per-URL. Use only when commit history actually contains the touched UI (verify via `git log -- <ui-path>`); never use to silence a missing implementation.

   The PreToolUse hook `pre-archive-ux-gate.sh` runs `archive-gate.sh --pre-skill <name>` before this skill starts, which skips Check 4 (Manual Review Kind Validation) because annotations are populated by Step 3.5 above. Now that Step 3.5 has run, validate the post-walkthrough state by re-running the gate **without** `--pre-skill`:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/spectra-advanced/archive-gate.sh "<change-name>"
   ```

   **Branch on exit code:**

   - **Exit 0** → All checks pass. Proceed to Step 6.
   - **Exit 2** → A check failed. Most common cause: Step 3.5 walkthrough was interrupted / skipped / produced incomplete annotations. Other checks (1/2/3/5/6) already passed pre-skill, so a failure here is almost certainly Check 4 — **or Check 7（缺 Step 8a.6 的 E.1 verdict record；補跑 `pre-handoff-ledger.mjs record --layer E.1 ...` 後重試，或對非適用 change 加 `<!-- pre-handoff-verdict: intentional, reason: ... -->` 到 tasks.md）**。
     - Display the gate stderr to the user.
     - **MUST** prompt via `AskUserQuestion`:
       - **Fix now** — go back to Step 3.5 and finish walkthrough for the items the gate flagged
       - **Abort archive** — stop the skill, leave change in-flight; user investigates manually
     - **NEVER** silently bypass exit 2 — Check 4 is the only post-walkthrough validation that the pre-skill path defers.

   **Skip condition**: if the gate script does not exist (consumer pre-propagation state), warn and proceed (fail-open, matches existing Check 5 fail-open behavior).

   **Layer C — data-sanity audit**（clade fork addition; pre-handoff quality gates; not in upstream spectra）：archive-gate 過後、spec-sync 前，對本 change 跑 static data-shape audit，擋住「client query param literal 違反 server zod bound → silent 4xx → lookup map empty → admin list column 整列 fallback」這類 typecheck/lint/視覺都抓不到的資料形狀問題（<consumer-a> `app-status-badge-extraction` root cause）：

   ```bash
   node <clade-vendor>/scripts/audit-data-sanity.mjs --consumer-path . --json
   ```

   - **exit 0 `status: "pass"`** → 通過（advisory lookupRisks 印 stderr 供參考，不 block）；進 sidecar advance。
   - **exit 1 `status: "fail"`**（PARAM_BOUNDARY，Critical）→ **MUST block archive**：顯示 violations 給 user，root-cause 修 client literal 到 bound 內（典型 `perPage: 200`→`100`）或調 server schema 後 re-run。**NEVER** silently bypass、**NEVER** 標 archive done 留給 user manual review 抓。
   - **Skip condition**: `audit-data-sanity.mjs` 不存在（consumer pre-propagation）→ warn + 跳過（fail-open，與 Check 5 一致）。
   - 完整偵測 / 限制（heuristic param-name 跨檔對應）見 `/data-sanity` skill。

   **Sidecar advance (TD-155)** — once gates pass (exit 0 or user explicitly bypassed), advance phase before entering spec-sync / archive CLI:

   ```bash
   node scripts/spectra-archive-sidecar.mjs update <change-name> --phase spec-sync --last-completed gate-check
   ```

   (silent fail-safe if helper / sidecar missing.)

6. **Perform the archive**

   Use the `spectra archive` CLI command which handles the full archive workflow
   (spec snapshot, delta application, @trace injection, identity recording, vector indexing):

   ```bash
   spectra archive <name>
   ```

   **Optional flags:**
   - `--skip-specs` — skip delta spec application (for tooling/doc-only changes)
   - `--mark-tasks-complete` — mark all incomplete tasks as complete before archiving
   - `--no-validate` — skip delta spec validation

   **If archive fails** with "already exists" error, suggest renaming existing archive.

   **Sidecar advance (TD-155)** — **only after `spectra archive` exits 0**, advance phase:

   ```bash
   node scripts/spectra-archive-sidecar.mjs update <change-name> --phase folder-mv --last-completed spec-sync
   ```

   **NEVER** advance the sidecar to `folder-mv` if the CLI failed or was interrupted — leaving `phase=spec-sync` is the trigger that lets Step 0.5 detect the dangerous mid-CLI state and force manual fixup on next `--resume`. (silent fail-safe if helper / sidecar missing.)

7. **Sweep screenshots (auto)**

   After successful archive, **automatically** invoke the `screenshots-archive` skill (via Skill tool) with `change <change-name>` to sweep the corresponding screenshot folders into `screenshots/<env>/_archive/YYYY-MM/`.

   - Caller-trusted: spectra-archive completing = the change is closed = its screenshots belong in `_archive/` (no extra confirmation here; `screenshots-archive` Mode B handles topic-name mismatch internally).
   - **Skip condition**: if user explicitly passed `--no-sweep` (or said "不要 sweep 截圖") when invoking spectra-archive, skip this step and note in Step 8 summary: `Screenshots: sweep skipped (user --no-sweep)`.
   - **Failure handling**: if `screenshots-archive` errors (e.g., disk write failure), do NOT fail the overall archive — log the error and note in Step 8 summary: `Screenshots: sweep failed — see error above`. The change is already archived; sweep is best-effort cleanup.

   **Note (TD-160 preserve)**: when Step 0 ran `wt-helper merge-back`, gitignored worktree screenshots at `screenshots/<env>/<topic>/` are automatically copied to main before cleanup destroys the worktree (see `preserveWorktreeScreenshots` in `vendor/scripts/wt-helper.mjs`). Step 7 sweep therefore finds the files in main as expected. Without this preserve, cleanup would delete them and sweep would be a no-op.

   **Sidecar advance (TD-155)** — after sweep completes (success, skipped, or failed — all three count as "Step 7 phase reached"):

   ```bash
   node scripts/spectra-archive-sidecar.mjs update <change-name> --phase screenshot-sweep --last-completed folder-mv
   ```

   (silent fail-safe if helper / sidecar missing.)

7.5. **Auto-reconcile merge-back stash (clade fork; auto-善後 — no tail)**

   merge-back (`--auto-stash`, Step 0) sets aside main's pre-merge dirty as `wt-merge-block/<change>/...` so the squash can land cleanly. **This is main's OWN work, NOT stale change residue** — typically HANDOFF entries from parallel sessions, ROADMAP/spec regen, telemetry appends. It **MUST be restored** to main's working tree (so it lands with the user's eventual `/commit`); the archive **auto-善後** it here and **NEVER leaves a stash tail for the user** (the only exception is a genuine per-file divergence, which is surfaced, not buried).

   > **NEVER blanket-drop a `wt-merge-block` stash.** Proven incident (2026-06-11): a `wt-merge-block` stash held a *parallel session's* `receiving-material-map` HANDOFF entry (blocked-status handoff for another in-flight change); the old "drop archived-slug" guidance would have destroyed it. `wt-merge-block` = main's blockers, not change residue. (`stash-reconcile.mjs` itself already recommends `apply` for clean merge-block entries — the old AskUserQuestion+keep default was the bug, not the script.)

   ```bash
   node scripts/stash-reconcile.mjs --slug "<change-name>" --json
   ```

   Parse JSON `entries`. If empty → `Reconcile: 0 entries`, proceed. For each entry, branch on `namespace.kind` (main thread runs the git ops directly — **no AskUserQuestion** in the common path):

   - **`wt-merge-block`** → **auto-restore per-file**:

     ```bash
     REF="<entry.ref e.g. stash@{0}>"
     # archive already produced the authoritative version of these → keep current, do NOT restore the stale stash copy
     REGEN_RE='^(openspec/ROADMAP\.md|openspec/specs/)'
     surfaced=()
     for f in $(git stash show --include-untracked --name-only "$REF"); do
       echo "$f" | grep -qE "$REGEN_RE" && continue   # keep current post-archive version
       # restore only when main has NOT independently changed f since the stash
       # (current working file === stash base → no divergence → safe to restore stash content)
       if diff -q <(git show "$REF^1:$f" 2>/dev/null) "$f" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
         git checkout "$REF" -- "$f"                  # restore main's set-aside work
       else
         surfaced+=("$f")                             # diverged since stash — do NOT auto-overwrite
       fi
     done
     if [ ${#surfaced[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
       git stash drop "$REF"                          # fully reconciled — no tail
     fi   # else: keep stash, report surfaced[] for manual handling (rare)
     ```

     Report `Reconcile: restored N file(s) from merge-block, dropped stash` (or, if surfaced) `Reconcile: M file(s) diverged — stash kept, see <list>`.

   - **`wt-baseline` / `wt-final-baseline`** → pre-fork pin, stale post-archive (content pinned as `refs/wt-baseline/...`): `git stash drop <entry.ref>`. Report `Reconcile: dropped baseline pin`.

   - **other / unknown kind** → do NOT auto-touch; print `ref` + file list, note `Reconcile: 1 unknown-shape entry kept (manual)`.

   **Restrictions**:
   - **NEVER** drop a `wt-merge-block` stash without first restoring its non-regenerated files — that loses main's real work (e.g. parallel-session HANDOFF entries).
   - **NEVER** auto-overwrite a file that diverged from the stash base (`surfaced[]`) — surface it instead; this is the *only* path that leaves a tail, and it is warranted (a genuine conflict needs human eyes).
   - **NEVER** restore archive-regenerated paths (`openspec/ROADMAP.md`, `openspec/specs/**`) from the stash — the archive's freshly-applied version is authoritative; the stash holds the pre-archive snapshot, which would revert the archive.
   - **NEVER** fall back to AskUserQuestion + "keep all" for a clean `wt-merge-block` entry — that is the old tail-leaving behavior this step replaces.
   - **Skip condition**: `--no-reconcile` → note `Reconcile: skipped (user --no-reconcile)`.
   - **Failure handling**: any git op error → do NOT fail the archive (already done); note `Reconcile: failed — see error above` + leave the stash intact for the user.
   - **Note in Step 8 summary**: `Reconcile: restored N / dropped` / `Reconcile: M diverged — stash kept` / `Reconcile: dropped baseline pin` / `Reconcile: 0 entries` / `Reconcile: skipped` / `Reconcile: failed`.

   **Sidecar advance (TD-155)** — after stash reconcile completes (any outcome), advance to final phase:

   ```bash
   node scripts/spectra-archive-sidecar.mjs update <change-name> --phase cleanup --last-completed screenshot-sweep
   ```

   (silent fail-safe if helper / sidecar missing.)

7.7. **Notion ticket status — ensure 進行中 + surface pending 驗收中**（clade fork addition — per [[spectra-notion-coupling]]）

   **Skip-condition**（任一成立即 silent skip）：consumer-meta `notion.ticketWorkflow !== true`；或本 change 的 `proposal.md`（已搬到 `openspec/changes/archive/<date>-<name>/proposal.md`）頂部無 `> **Notion ticket**:` 連結。不適用時**不要**硬湊 ticket。

   兩條件都成立時，**MUST**：

   1. 抓 ticket `page_id`（proposal.md 頂部）+ consumer-meta `notion.dataSourceId`。
   2. `notion-fetch collection://<dataSourceId>` 重撈 schema 校對 property key（中文 + 全形空格 + `>=`，憑記憶必錯）。
   3. **Ensure 進行中**：ticket 若還停在 `未開始` / `需確認` → 補轉 `→ 進行中`（per `~/.claude/skills/_notion-tdms-board/REFERENCE.md §3`）。
   4. **Pending 驗收中**：archive 是 bookkeeping，**此刻尚無本次發版 git tag**（標準順序「先 archive 再 `/commit`」，tag 在 `/commit` Step 5 才生）→ **NEVER 在此推 `驗收中`**；改在 Step 8 summary 明文列 pending 動作（見下），由緊接的 `/commit` 發版後**同一主線**完成 `進行中 → 驗收中` + 填 `修復版本 >= <tag>`。

   **NEVER** 在 archive 當下標 `驗收中`（無 tag）或填 `修復版本 >=`。**NEVER** 碰客戶側轉移（`驗收中→完成` 等）或 `發布日期` / `驗收日期` / `名稱` / `驗收完成` 欄位。

8. **Display summary**

   Show archive completion summary including:
   - Change name
   - Schema that was used
   - Archive location
   - Spec sync status (synced / sync skipped / no delta specs)
   - Note about any warnings (incomplete artifacts/tasks)
   - **Notion ticket pending**（only when Step 7.7 applied — consumer-meta `notion.ticketWorkflow` + change 有連結）：一行明文 `📌 Notion ticket <page_id>：已 ensure 進行中；待 /commit 發版產 git tag 後 → 轉 驗收中 + 填 修復版本 >= <tag>（同一主線跑完 /commit 立即執行，NEVER 留到下次想起來）`（per [[spectra-notion-coupling]]）

   **Sidecar cleanup (TD-155)** — after the summary is displayed (archive considered complete from the user's perspective), delete the sidecar:

   ```bash
   node scripts/spectra-archive-sidecar.mjs delete <change-name>
   ```

   (silent fail-safe: if sidecar is already missing — e.g., consumer pre-propagate — the helper is a no-op.)

**Output On Success**

```
## Archive Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Worktree:** ✓ Absorbed into main (or: no worktree — solo path)
**Archived to:** openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/
**Specs:** ✓ Synced to main specs
**Screenshots:** ✓ Swept to _archive/YYYY-MM/ (or: no screenshots / skipped (user --no-sweep) / sweep failed)

All artifacts complete. All tasks complete.
```

If Step 0 stashed blockers, append a line under **Worktree**:
```
**Stash to reconcile:** wt-merge-block/<change-name>/<ISO> (run `node scripts/stash-reconcile.mjs` to plan)
```

**Output On Success (No Delta Specs)**

```
## Archive Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Archived to:** openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/
**Specs:** No delta specs
**Screenshots:** ✓ Swept to _archive/YYYY-MM/ (or: no screenshots / skipped / failed)

All artifacts complete. All tasks complete.
```

**Output On Success With Warnings**

```
## Archive Complete (with warnings)

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Archived to:** openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/
**Specs:** Sync skipped (user chose to skip)
**Screenshots:** Sweep failed — see error above

**Warnings:**
- Archived with 2 incomplete artifacts
- Archived with 3 incomplete tasks
- Delta spec sync was skipped (user chose to skip)
- Screenshot sweep failed (archive itself succeeded)

Review the archive if this was not intentional.
```

**Output On Error (Archive Exists)**

```
## Archive Failed

**Change:** <change-name>
**Target:** openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/

Target archive directory already exists.

**Options:**
1. Rename the existing archive
2. Delete the existing archive if it's a duplicate
3. Wait until a different date to archive
```

**Guardrails**

- Always prompt for change selection if not provided
- Use artifact graph (spectra status --json) for completion checking
- Don't block archive on warnings - just inform and confirm
- Preserve .openspec.yaml when moving to archive (it moves with the directory)
- Show clear summary of what happened
- If sync is requested, use the Skill tool to invoke `spectra-sync-specs` (agent-driven)
- If delta specs exist, always run the sync assessment and show the combined summary before prompting
- If **AskUserQuestion tool** is not available, ask the same questions as plain text and wait for the user's response
- **NEVER** skip Step 7 screenshot sweep silently — always run it (unless `--no-sweep`); sweep failure must surface in summary, but **NEVER** roll back the successful archive on sweep failure
- **ALWAYS** call `screenshots-archive` via Skill tool with explicit `change <change-name>` argument so Mode B logic (caller-trusted, internal topic-mismatch prompt) kicks in
