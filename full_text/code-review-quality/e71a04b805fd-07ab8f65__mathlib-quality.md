# Mathlib Quality Skill

## Activation Triggers

This skill activates when:
- Working with `.lean` files intended for mathlib contribution
- User mentions "mathlib style", "cleanup", "golf", "PR submission", or "pre-submit"
- User asks to fix reviewer feedback on a mathlib PR
- User wants to check code against mathlib conventions
- User asks "what's the project status?", "where are we stuck?", "what's the
  bottleneck?", "what's the worker doing?", "show me progress" → run `/project-status`

## Overview

This skill helps bring Lean 4 code up to mathlib standards by:
1. Enforcing style rules (line length, formatting, indentation)
2. Checking naming conventions
3. Ensuring proper documentation
4. Golfing proofs to be shorter and cleaner
5. Preparing code for PR submission

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/develop` | **Planning only, with binding methodical-decomposition pre-work.** Phases 1a–1d: gather context, study references, search mathlib, design API. **Phase 1e (binding pre-work)**: for each top-level result, write the prose proof, decompose into ordered lemmas, **physically state every lemma as `:= by sorry` in the project's Lean files (Step 2.5 — skeleton must `lake build` clean)**, then tension against the references **with a verbatim source quote per leaf and a Lean ↔ source match paragraph (Step 3)**. Verify every leaf is discharged from mathlib (cited + verified) or already-developed project code — gaps become explicit API-gap sub-trees. Save `decomposition.md`. Only after every leaf is verified across (Lean declaration + verbatim quote + citation) does ticket creation (1g) proceed. Then ChatGPT validation (1h) and user approval (1i). Workers run via `/beastmode`. **Flag `--decompose`** runs ONLY Phase 1e and stops — for iterating on the skeleton / decomposition / source quotes before committing to a ticket board. |
| `/beastmode` | **Marathon execution. Stops at nothing — but stays on-target.** Pick a ticket, finish the goal no matter how deep the path goes. Spawn sub-tickets in `/develop`'s template format; replan via `/develop --continue` when a sketch is wrong; no recursion cap, no time budget. **Continuously checks on-target** before each sub-ticket and step (serves the plan? stays in the project's mathematical area? a refinement not a divergence?). **Welcomes scope growth that stays on target** — a "two lemmas" step turning into ten is great news, not a stop signal. Super Saiyan ethos: the harder the work, the more energy goes in. **Mandatory post-proof cleanup (Phase 6.5):** after gates pass and before mark-done, invokes `Skill(mathlib-quality:cleanup)` on every new declaration — full 11-phase workflow, no phase-skipping (enforced via /cleanup's own phase checklist), including the 6.5 simplify and 6.6 buzz (performance) hand-offs; decompose flags spawn /decompose-proof sub-tickets, rename queue drained inside /cleanup's Phase 5b. Only stops: DONE / SCOPE-DEFINITION ERROR / OFF-TRACK (drift outside the project's mathematical scope, with concrete evidence) / BROKEN BASELINE. **"This is multi-session work" is NOT a stop** — it is the target signal. Beastmode exists to collapse multi-session work into one continuous run. |
| `/cleanup` | Style audit + cleanup + golf (whole file or single declaration). **11-phase methodical workflow**: doctor (baseline build) → prepare → audit punch-list → file-level fixes → per-declaration deep golf with diff gates → refactoring (5a non-rename + 5b rename pass) → final gates + cumulative checks → built-in `/simplify` pass → `/buzz` performance pass → report. **Absorbed**: `/check-style` (Phase 2 audit), `/check-mathlib` (Phase 4 item 13 — five-method search + six strict rules + common-equivalents lookup), the inline mechanical pass of `/generalise` (Phase 4 item 18), and shouyi-style diff gates (Phase 4 + 6). Phase 6.5 hand-off to the built-in `/simplify` skill catches holistic issues the rule-driven pass missed; Phase 6.6 hand-off to `/buzz` gets every declaration under the elaboration budget (deferrals feed `/decompose-proof`). |
| `/cleanup-all` | **Orchestrator-worker pattern for project-wide cleanup.** Main session is the orchestrator: enumerates files, buckets by size, dispatches batched `Agent` calls with a ~1200-char verbatim prompt (working dir + branch + build + file list + target), narrates progress in one-line scoreboards between dispatches. Workers do the file reading, LSP, edits, Phase-4 sub-worker dispatch, and build verification in fresh contexts. Orchestrator never reads/edits/builds. The pattern that sustained a 28-day, 9000-message marathon. |
| `/decompose-proof` | Break long proofs into helper lemmas |
| `/buzz` | **Profile → trace → fix slow declarations (target <1s each).** One profiled compile per file → per-decl timing table → trace-driven diagnosis against the eight-cause taxonomy in `references/profiling.md` → measured fixes, with same-issue propagation across the remaining slow decls. Statements byte-identical; limit raises forbidden (existing `maxHeartbeats` removed); profiling scaffolding gate-checked out. PR mode by default; also `<file>`, `<file> <decl>`, `--all`, `--budget <ms>`. Runs automatically as `/cleanup` Phase 6.6. |
| `/overview` | **Project survey + per-decl mathlibable assessment.** Inventory + cross-file analyses (mathlib API audit, duplications, generalisation, missing API, junk) + **Step 9 Mathlibable Assessment**: pre-filters obvious SKIPs, then dispatches one `Skill(mathlib-quality:mathlibable)` per remaining public decl running the full 10-phase exhaustive workflow. Sequential with one-line scoreboard between. Per-decl detail reports go to `.mathlib-quality/overview/mathlibable/<decl>.md`. Writes `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` with per-bucket action lists. `--skip-mathlibable` for the faster draft view (all other steps). |
| `/project-status` | **Chat-only mathematical status.** The agent reads the project's `.lean` files (and `plan.md` / `tickets.md` if present) and reports in mathematical English: what result the worker is currently on, what (if anything) is blocked and what is missing, how the current work connects to the project's overall goal, and how far along the whole project is. Read-only — no server, no browser. Tone is descriptive math reportage, not difficulty rhetoric. |
| `/expert-review` | Two-mode skill for external mathematical review. **Mode 1**: produce a self-contained `REVIEW_BRIEF.md` (no Lean, no file paths) — goals, plan, references, status, blockers, numbered questions — and stop, waiting for the reviewer's reply. **Mode 2** (`--reply`): once the reviewer responds, map their answers onto our questions, propose ticket/work-order updates, apply only after user approval. Session history persists in `.mathlib-quality/expert-review/<date>/`. |
| `/generalise` | Audit a lemma or definition for assumption weakening. Tries mechanical weakenings from a catalogue (typeclass parents, drop-unused, point-localise, strict→weak), then performs a literature search (WebSearch + ChatGPT MCP if available + mathlib's five-method search). Auto-applies small safe changes; presents big changes (public-API, restating, renames) as numbered options for user approval. |
| `/split-file` | Split large files (>1500 lines) into focused modules |
| `/pre-submit` | Pre-PR submission checklist |
| `/self-review` | **N rounds of neutral, independent review-and-implement before a PR (default 3).** Each round spawns a **fresh, unbiased review `Agent`** (techniques from the built-in `/review` + `/check-style`, specialised to four Lean dimensions: **definition necessity** (`def` vs notation), **generalisation** (how far and in what way), **automation** (best use of `simp`/`grind`/`aesop`/`fun_prop`/project-local tactics — deterministic automation beats a hand-rolled non-deterministic proof), and **mathlib naming/style**), reports its findings to the user, implements **every** suggestion (a change that breaks the build is attempted-then-reverted and documented, never silently skipped), reports the summary, and relaunches until N rounds are done. Findings post to the PR thread when one exists, else chat-only. The reviewer steelmans before reporting and **never rubber-stamps — not even on the final round**; termination is the loop's fixed N, not the reviewer's call. Fresh `Agent` per round (not `SendMessage`), no commits/pushes. |
| `/bump-mathlib` | Bump mathlib version and fix resulting breakage |
| `/mathlibable` | **Decide whether a Lean declaration belongs in mathlib.** Slow, methodical, ten-phase gated workflow with required artifacts per phase: doctor → comprehend → preliminary BIG/SMALL + one-line check (with defeq-abuse / diamond-avoidance / API-stability exemptions) → **EXHAUSTIVE literature search (always, every call — no `--quick` flag)**: WebSearch ×≥3 + ChatGPT MCP (with historical-formulation question) + local refs + nLab + nCatLab + Stacks + MathOverflow + arXiv → generality analysis vs literature-standard PLUS **Phase 4c modern-mathlib-idiom restatement (the Bourbaki 2.0 check)** asking whether contemporary mathlib tools (typeclasses, filters, universal properties, bundled types, module hierarchy, higher categories) would re-state with real downstream consequences → diamond/defeq risk assessment for `def`/`class`/`instance` → mathlib five-method search on user's form AND literature-standard AND modern-idiom forms → composition check (≤3 mathlib calls?) → verdict in one of five buckets (`YES-add-as-is`, `YES-but-generalise-first`, `NO-mathlib-has-it`, `NO-composable-from-mathlib`, `BORDERLINE-needs-human`). Cost is NOT a verdict factor (EXPENSIVE generalisations are explicitly worth doing). Phase-7 gate rejects unsupported verdicts, cost-based downgrades, and modern-idiom claims without concrete downstream consequences. **Mode A**: single declaration per call. **Mode B**: `/mathlibable <file.lean>` or `/mathlibable <file1.lean> <file2.lean> ...` — orchestrator-worker pattern dispatches one Agent per public decl sequentially, scoreboard between, writes `MATHLIBABLE_REPORT.md` aggregating verdicts. Also invoked from `/overview` Step 9 in the same way. Per-decl detail reports go to `.mathlib-quality/mathlibable/<decl>.md`. Bourbaki 2.0 philosophy + canonical modernisation cases + worked examples per bucket in `references/mathlibable-verdicts.md`. |
| `/blueprint` | **Author or update the project's verso-blueprint** — wraps [`leanprover/verso-blueprint`](https://github.com/leanprover/verso-blueprint) (the Verso-based tool behind verso-sphere-packing, verso-flt, verso-carleson). Chapter files are `.lean` modules under `<Project>/Chapters/`; statements are `:::theorem "label" (lean := "Foo.bar")` directives; dep-graph edges are `{uses "label"}[]`; math is KaTeX. Verso auto-computes completion status from `(lean := …)` — no manual `\leanok`. Seven-phase workflow (doctor → enumerate → plan → prose context → author → cross-link → hand-off). One worker per declaration; reads project references + module docstrings + `/develop`'s `decomposition.md` if present. Modes: whole-project default, single-file, `--decl <Foo.bar>` (single-decl + closure, non-interactive), `--update`, `--check`, **`--migrate-from-latex [<dir>]`** (one-shot mechanical 1:1 conversion of a legacy `leanblueprint` LaTeX tree). Phase 6 hand-off runs `./scripts/ci-pages.sh` and verifies `_out/site/html-multi/`. Conventions + Verso-specific deployment gotchas in `references/blueprint-conventions.md`. |
| `/unformalise` | **Turn one Lean declaration into mathematics.** Unicode terminal render by default (Γ, ℂ, ℍ, →, ≤ — readable in chat); after rendering, asks `[b]` add to blueprint as Verso / `[v]` Verso to stdout / `[m]` Markdown / `[n]` terminal-only. Non-interactive: `--verso`, `--md`, `--blueprint`. Single-decl default; `--closure` walks deps; whole-file mode also allowed. Shares the unformalisation worker logic with `/blueprint` Phase 4 (same `references/blueprint-conventions.md`). Conversational sibling to `/blueprint --decl`. |
| `/fix-pr-feedback` | Fetch PR comments, implement fixes locally, **wait for user approval before pushing**, then watch CI to completion. 8-phase workflow with explicit comment-coverage check. |
| `/setup-chatgpt` | Set up ChatGPT MCP server for mathematical second opinions |
| `/teach` | Teach the skill a project-specific pattern or convention |
| `/contribute` | Contribute local learnings back to the repo via PR |
| `/integrate-learnings` | (Maintainers) Process community contributions into reference docs |

## First-Time Setup

For mathematical second opinions from ChatGPT during formalization work, run `/setup-chatgpt`. This creates an MCP server that lets Claude Code query ChatGPT via the Codex CLI for proof strategies, Mathlib API hints, or verification of mathematical claims. Requires the ChatGPT desktop app and a Plus/Pro subscription.

## Core Style Rules (Quick Reference)

### File Structure
- **File names**: `UpperCamelCase.lean` (e.g., `TopologicalSpace.lean`)
- **Line length**: 100 characters max
- **File length**: 1500 lines max (MUST split if larger)
- **Proof length**: **50 lines absolute max** (target <15 lines for main theorems)
- **Header order**: Copyright, module docstring, imports
- **Comments in proofs**: PRESERVE signpost comments (rule reversed in v0.58.0 — maintainers want more proof comments, not fewer); golf re-anchors them, never deletes
- **Module system**: New files should have `module` keyword before imports

### Formatting
- **Indentation**: 2 spaces for continuation lines, 4 for multi-line theorem statements
- **`by` placement**: Always at END of preceding line (not on its own line)
- **Focusing dot**: Use `·` (not indented) for subgoals
- **One tactic per line** (preferred)
- **Prefer**: `fun x ↦ ...` over `λ x, ...`
- **Prefer**: `<|` over `$` to avoid parentheses
- **Prefer**: `change` over `show` in proofs
- **No trailing whitespace**
- **No empty lines inside declarations**

### Line Length: MAXIMIZE to 100 Characters (CRITICAL)

**Fill lines to ~100 characters.** Do NOT break lines at 50-60 characters when there is room for more. Short lines waste vertical space and make proofs look longer than they need to be.

**Rule**: Pack as much as fits on each line, up to the 100-character limit. Only break when you must.

Lean's own pretty-printer (`format.width`, default 120 cols) follows the same principle — fill to
the target width, break at natural boundaries. Mathlib uses 100 chars. Match the compactness that
Lean's formatter would produce at width 100.

**Formatting tools to use:**
- **`simp only` lists**: Use `simp?` and apply its "Try this:" suggestion — Lean formats it correctly
- **Theorem signatures**: Use `#check @theorem_name` as a width reference — if Lean packs the type
  compactly, your declaration syntax should be equally compact
- **`exact`/`rw` calls**: Use `exact?`/`rw?` when available for correct formatting

**Signatures**: Put multiple parameters on the same line. Only break to a new line when the next parameter would exceed 100 chars.

```lean
-- BAD: breaks lines too early, wastes vertical space
theorem pv_chain_identity
    (S : Finset UpperHalfPlane)
    (hS : ∀ p ∈ S, p ∈ 𝒟)
    (hS_complete :
      ∀ p, p ∈ 𝒟 →
        orderOfVanishingAt' (⇑f) p ≠ 0 → p ∈ S) :
    ∃ H₀ : ℝ, ... := by

-- GOOD: fills to ~100 chars, fewer lines
theorem pv_chain_identity (S : Finset UpperHalfPlane) (hS : ∀ p ∈ S, p ∈ 𝒟)
    (hS_complete : ∀ p, p ∈ 𝒟 → orderOfVanishingAt' (⇑f) p ≠ 0 → p ∈ S) :
    ∃ H₀ : ℝ, ... := by
```

**`simp only` lists**: Pack lemma names to fill the line. Do not put one or two per line.

```lean
-- BAD: artificially narrow
  simp only [ne_eq, mul_eq_zero,
    OfNat.ofNat_ne_zero, not_false_eq_true,
    ofReal_eq_zero, Real.pi_ne_zero,
    I_ne_zero, or_self]

-- GOOD: fills to ~100 chars
  simp only [ne_eq, mul_eq_zero, OfNat.ofNat_ne_zero, not_false_eq_true, ofReal_eq_zero,
    Real.pi_ne_zero, I_ne_zero, or_self]
```

**`have` statements and expressions**: Keep on one line when possible.

```lean
-- BAD: unnecessary line breaks in expression
  rw [show -(2 * ↑Real.pi * I *
      ((k : ℂ) / 12 - (orderAtCusp' f : ℂ))) =
    2 * ↑Real.pi * I *
      (-((k : ℂ) / 12 - (orderAtCusp' f : ℂ)))
    from by ring] at h_eq

-- GOOD: pack the expression
  rw [show -(2 * ↑Real.pi * I * ((k : ℂ) / 12 - (orderAtCusp' f : ℂ))) =
      2 * ↑Real.pi * I * (-((k : ℂ) / 12 - (orderAtCusp' f : ℂ))) from by ring] at h_eq
```

**Return type**: Keep conclusion on the same line as `:` when it fits.

```lean
-- BAD: conclusion on separate line unnecessarily
theorem foo (h : P) :
    Q := by

-- GOOD: fits on one line
theorem foo (h : P) : Q := by
```

### `by` Placement (CRITICAL)
```lean
-- CORRECT: by at end of preceding line
theorem foo : P := by
  exact h

-- WRONG: by on its own line
theorem foo : P :=
  by exact h
```

### Subgoal Focusing
```lean
-- Use focusing dot · at column 0
theorem foo : P ∧ Q := by
  constructor
· exact hp
· exact hq
```

### Instance Syntax
Use `where` syntax for structure/class instances:
```lean
instance instOrderBot : OrderBot ℕ where
  bot := 0
  bot_le := Nat.zero_le
```

### Naming Conventions

**CRITICAL: Different naming conventions for defs vs lemmas/theorems!**

| Declaration Type | Returns | Case Style | Example |
|------------------|---------|------------|---------|
| `lemma`/`theorem` | `Prop` | `snake_case` | `continuous_of_bounded` |
| `def` | Data (ℂ, ℝ, Set, etc.) | `lowerCamelCase` | `cauchyPrincipalValue` |
| `structure`/`inductive` | Type | `UpperCamelCase` | `ModularForm` |
| Structure fields | - | `lowerCamelCase` or `snake_case` | `toFun`, `map_one'` |

**Key rule:** Look at what the declaration **returns**:
- Returns a **Prop** (statement to prove) → `snake_case`
- Returns **data** (number, set, function, etc.) → `lowerCamelCase`
- Defines a **Type** → `UpperCamelCase`

**Examples:**
```lean
-- Lemmas/theorems (return Prop) → snake_case
theorem continuous_of_uniform : Continuous f := ...
lemma norm_le_of_mem_ball : ‖x‖ ≤ r := ...

-- Defs returning data → lowerCamelCase
def cauchyPrincipalValue (f : ℝ → ℂ) : ℂ := ...
def residueAtPole (f : ℂ → ℂ) (z₀ : ℂ) : ℂ := ...
def fundamentalDomain : Set ℂ := ...

-- Types → UpperCamelCase
structure ModularForm where ...
inductive BoundarySegment where ...
```

### Variable Conventions

| Type | Variables |
|------|-----------|
| Universes | `u`, `v`, `w` |
| Generic types | `α`, `β`, `γ` |
| Propositions | `a`, `b`, `c` |
| Type elements | `x`, `y`, `z` |
| Assumptions | `h`, `h₁`, `h₂` or `hf`, `hg` |
| Predicates | `p`, `q`, `r` |
| Lists/Sets | `s`, `t` |
| Naturals | `m`, `n`, `k` |
| Integers | `i`, `j`, `k` |
| Groups | `G`, `H` |
| Rings | `R`, `S` |
| Fields | `K`, `𝕜` |
| Vector spaces | `E`, `F` |

### Additional Conventions
- **Acronyms as groups**: `LE`, `Ne` (not `Le`, `NE`)
- **American English**: `Factorization` not `Factorisation`
- **Helper lemmas**: `_aux` suffix, must be `private`
- **Prop-valued classes**: "Is" prefix for nouns (`IsNormal`), no prefix for adjectives

### Naming Check and Fix (CRITICAL)
**All lemma/definition names MUST follow mathlib conventions.** When cleaning up a file:

1. **Check every declaration name** against the naming rules
2. **Rename non-conforming declarations** to follow conventions
3. **Update ALL usages** of renamed declarations in the file

**Common naming issues to fix:**
| Bad Name | Good Name | Rule |
|----------|-----------|------|
| `myLemma` | `my_lemma` | snake_case for lemmas |
| `Lemma1` | `lemma_one` or descriptive | no numbers, snake_case |
| `fooAux` | `foo_aux` | snake_case with _aux suffix |
| `helper` | `main_theorem_aux` | name should reference parent |
| `Factorisation` | `Factorization` | American English |
| `continuous_Function` | `continuous_function` | consistent snake_case |

### Symbol Dictionary for Naming

| Symbol | Name in identifiers |
|--------|---------------------|
| `∨` | `or` |
| `∧` | `and` |
| `→` | `imp` or `of` (hypothesis) |
| `↔` | `iff` (often omitted) |
| `¬` | `not` |
| `∀` | `forall` or `all` |
| `∃` | `exists` |
| `=` | `eq` (often omitted) |
| `≠` | `ne` |
| `∈` | `mem` |
| `∪` | `union` |
| `∩` | `inter` |
| `⋃` | `iUnion` (indexed) |
| `⋂` | `iInter` (indexed) |
| `\` | `sdiff` |
| `ᶜ` | `compl` |
| `+` | `add` |
| `-` | `sub` (binary) or `neg` (unary) |
| `*` | `mul` |
| `^` | `pow` |
| `/` | `div` |
| `•` | `smul` |
| `∣` | `dvd` |
| `≤` | `le` or `ge` (swapped) |
| `<` | `lt` or `gt` (swapped) |
| `⊔` | `sup` |
| `⊓` | `inf` |
| `⨆` | `iSup` (indexed) |
| `⨅` | `iInf` (indexed) |

### Hypothesis Ordering: `C_of_A_of_B`

For theorem `A → B → C`, name it `C_of_A_of_B` (hypotheses in appearance order):
```lean
-- Good: hypotheses in order of appearance
add_pos_of_pos_of_pos    -- conclusion: add_pos; hyps: pos, pos
continuous_of_uniform    -- conclusion: continuous; hyp: uniform
norm_bound_of_compact    -- conclusion: norm_bound; hyp: compact

-- Use abbreviations
pos, neg, nonpos, nonneg  -- replace zero_lt, lt_zero, le_zero, zero_le

-- Bad names
lemma1, helper, aux      -- non-descriptive
myCustomLemma            -- wrong case
```

### Structural Lemma Naming

| Pattern | Naming |
|---------|--------|
| Extensionality | `.ext` (marked `@[ext]`), `.ext_iff` |
| Injectivity | `f_injective` (Function.Injective), `f_inj` (bidir, `@[simp]`) |
| Induction (Prop) | `T.induction_on` (value first), `T.induction` (constructors first) |
| Recursion (Type) | `T.recOn` (value first), `T.rec` (constructors first) |

### Predicate Positioning
Most predicates are **prefixes**: `isClosed_Icc`, `isOpen_ball`

Exceptions (suffixes, like atoms): `_injective`, `_surjective`, `_bijective`, `_monotone`, `_antitone`

### Documentation Requirements
- Module docstring after imports (at the TOP of the file only)
- Docstrings ONLY for important public theorems and all definitions
- Keep docstrings **1-2 consecutive lines** describing what it proves/defines
- **NO blank lines inside docstrings** - must be consecutive lines
- **FORBIDDEN in docstrings** (proof-strategy prose is *relocated into the proof body* as
  `--` comments, never deleted):
  - Proof strategies or ideas (e.g., "**Proof idea**: ...")
  - Technical notes (e.g., "**Note**: The hypothesis...")
  - Multi-paragraph explanations
  - Implementation details
  - Bullet points explaining the proof
  - References to other proof assistants (e.g., Isabelle, HOL)
- **Section markers** (`/-! ## Section Name -/`) inside files are **standard mathlib
  practice** (~2,500 across ~900 mathlib files) — preserve existing ones; remove only
  genuinely contentless headers. (Rule reversed in v0.58.0; the old "only the top
  docstring is allowed" claim was factually wrong.)
  - Results within a section are separated by a single blank line

### Comments in Proofs
- **PRESERVE inline proof comments** — rule reversed in v0.58.0 after maintainer feedback:
  "'No comments in proofs' is NOT a mathlib style requirement — many maintainers believe
  there *should* be more comments in proofs." Golf re-anchors signposts to the rewritten
  steps; it never deletes them.
- Removable only with justification: factually wrong/stale comments, and comments that
  literally restate the next tactic
- Do NOT add docstrings to helper/private lemmas
- Do NOT explain proof steps in docstrings — that prose belongs *inside the proof* as
  `--` comments (relocate it there, don't delete it)

### Helper Lemmas and Visibility
- Helper lemmas use `_aux` suffix (e.g., `foo_aux`, `bar_step_aux`)
- Helper lemmas should be `private`
- Only results intended for use in other files/mathlib should be public
- If a lemma is only used within the file, make it private

## Learning System

The skill learns from every use and gets better over time. There are three layers:

### 1. Automatic Local Capture
Every command (`/cleanup`, `/develop`, `/bump-mathlib`, etc.) automatically records significant learnings to `.mathlib-quality/learnings.jsonl` in your project. This captures:
- Proof golfing patterns that worked (before/after code)
- Style corrections applied
- Mathlib lemmas discovered that replaced custom code
- Patterns that failed (valuable negative data)
- User corrections to agent suggestions

### 2. Local Recall
The MCP server loads local learnings at query time and boosts search results with project-specific patterns. This means suggestions improve as you use the tool more within a project.

### 3. Opt-in Contribution
Run `/contribute` to review your local learnings and create a PR on the mathlib-quality repo. This shares your discoveries with all users. Learnings are anonymized before contribution.

### Teaching the Skill
Use `/teach` to explicitly record project-specific patterns:
```
/teach "always use grind before omega for Fin goals in this project"
/teach "in this codebase, prefer explicit universe variables"
```

### How Learnings Are Stored
- **Local**: `.mathlib-quality/learnings.jsonl` (JSONL format, one entry per line)
- **Community**: `data/community_learnings/` (contributed via PRs)
- **Schema**: See `skills/mathlib-quality/learning/schema.md` for the full JSON schema

## Workflow Guidance

### When Developing New Mathematics

Use `/develop` to plan and execute a mathematical development:
1. **Plan**: `/develop` creates a comprehensive plan with ticket board
2. **Execute**: Workers pick up tickets, prove lemmas, build API
3. **Cleanup**: Periodic `/cleanup` tickets keep code at mathlib quality
4. **Review**: Final review ensures everything compiles and is PR-ready

### When Preparing a PR

1. **Overview**: Run `/overview` to generate a full declaration inventory.
2. **Cleanup + golf**: Run `/cleanup` on each file — one agent per declaration.
3. **Decompose**: Run `/decompose-proof` on files with long proofs.
4. **Final check**: Run `/pre-submit` before creating PR.

**For quick single-proof golfing**: Use `/cleanup file.lean theorem_name`.

### When Handling PR Feedback

1. Copy reviewer comments or provide PR number
2. Run `/fix-pr-feedback`
3. Verify each fix compiles
4. Re-run `/pre-submit` before pushing

## Integration with Lean 4 Tools

This skill works alongside the `lean4-theorem-proving` skill:
- Use Lean LSP tools to verify changes compile
- Use `lean_diagnostic_messages` to check for errors after edits
- Use `lean_goal` to verify proof state during golfing

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Overly long lines** - Break at operators, align continuations
1b. **Overly SHORT lines** - CRITICAL: Fill lines to ~100 chars. Do NOT break at 50-60 chars when there is room. Pack parameters, simp lists, and expressions to use available space.
2. **Verbose proofs** - Golf aggressively; one-liners are ideal
3. **Unnecessary `have` blocks** - Inline `have foo := bar` unless used 2+ times
   - `have h := lemma x` → inline as `lemma x` where used
   - `have h : T := by ...` → keep (has proof content) or extract as helper
4. **Non-descriptive names** - Use conclusion-of-hypotheses pattern
5. **Verbose docstrings** - Keep them short (one sentence), no proof strategies
6. **Docstrings on helpers** - Only important public theorems need docstrings
7. **Non-terminal `simp` without arguments** - Use `simp only [...]` for non-terminal simp
   - Terminal `simp` (closing the goal) should NOT be squeezed unless performance is poor
8. **Trailing `sorry`** - Remove all before submission
9. **Debug options** - Remove `set_option trace.*`
10. **Deleted proof comments** - Preserve and re-anchor signpost comments during golf; only wrong/stale or tactic-restating comments are removable (rule reversed in v0.58.0)
11. **Not using `fun_prop`** - Prefer `fun_prop` over `continuity`/`measurability`
12. **Monolithic files** - Split files > 1500 lines by theme
13. **Public helpers** - Helper lemmas should be `private` with `_aux` suffix
14. **Non-private internal lemmas** - Only export what other files need
15. **Long proofs (>50 lines)** - CRITICAL: decompose into helpers; target <15 lines for main theorems
16. **Duplicated proof logic** - Extract shared patterns into parameterized common helpers
17. **Not understanding the mathematics** - Before decomposing, describe the proof in plain language
18. **`by` on its own line** - ALWAYS put `by` at end of preceding line
19. **Using `λ` instead of `fun`** - Use `fun x ↦ ...`
20. **Empty lines inside declarations** - Keep declarations compact
21. **`≥` or `>` in statements / hypotheses** - Mathlib convention: every inequality in Lean code is `≤` / `<` (smaller side on the left). Lemma names are `_le_` / `_lt_`, never `_ge_` / `_gt_`. Enforced by `/cleanup` audit item 19 + `inequality_orientation_gate`. Docstrings and `--` comments may keep `≥`/`>` where natural — the rule is about Lean code.

## Deprecation Format

When renaming/removing public declarations, use:
```lean
@[deprecated (since := "YYYY-MM-DD")]
alias old_name := new_name

-- With explanation
@[deprecated "Use foo_bar instead" (since := "YYYY-MM-DD")]
theorem old_theorem ...
```
Deprecations can be removed after 6 months.

## Proof Decomposition

**Rule: No proof should exceed 50 lines. Target: main theorems <15 lines.**

Long proofs indicate the mathematical structure hasn't been properly captured. Every proof
decomposes naturally based on its mathematical content.

### Thresholds
| Length | Action |
|--------|--------|
| <15 lines | Ideal |
| 15-30 lines | Consider decomposition |
| 30-50 lines | **Must decompose** |
| >50 lines | **Critical - aggressive decomposition required** |

### The Decomposition Process (CRITICAL)

**This is a careful, systematic process. Do it right, not fast.**

#### Step 1: Identify Long Proofs
Scan the file and list ALL proofs >30 lines with their line numbers and counts.

#### Step 2: Understand the Complete Proof
Before touching any code, read the entire proof and answer:
1. What is the theorem proving (in plain language)?
2. What are the key mathematical steps in the argument?
3. What independent facts are being established?
4. What estimates/bounds appear?
5. Are there `cases`, `by_cases`, `rcases` that split into independent branches?
6. Are there repeated patterns across different proofs?

#### Step 3: Search Mathlib FIRST
**Before extracting ANY helper, search mathlib** to see if it already exists:
```
lean_loogle "Continuous → Bounded"           -- Type pattern search
lean_leansearch "continuous function on compact is bounded"  -- Natural language
lean_local_search "continuousOn_compact"     -- Local name search
```

Many "helper lemmas" are already in mathlib. Use them instead of writing new ones.

#### Step 4: Generalize Before Extracting
**CRITICAL: Don't create single-use helpers.** Before extracting, ask:
- Can this lemma be stated more generally?
- Would this be useful in other contexts?
- Are the hypotheses minimal, or tied to specific context?

```lean
-- BAD: Single-use helper tied to specific context
private lemma residue_theorem_step1 (γ : PiecewiseC1Curve) (S0 : Finset ℂ)
    (hγ_in_U : ∀ t ∈ Icc γ.a γ.b, γ.toFun t ∈ U) : ... := ...

-- GOOD: General lemma that could be useful elsewhere
lemma norm_sum_le_of_disjoint_balls {S : Finset ℂ} {ε : ℝ} (hε : 0 < ε)
    (h_disjoint : ∀ s ∈ S, ∀ s' ∈ S, s ≠ s' → Disjoint (ball s ε) (ball s' ε)) :
    ‖∑ s ∈ S, f s‖ ≤ ∑ s ∈ S, ‖f s‖ := ...
```

#### Step 5: Extract Cases as Lemmas
If a proof has `cases h with | inl => ... | inr => ...` or `by_cases`:
- Each case is often a standalone lemma
- Extract each case, then combine them in the main proof

```lean
-- Before: 80-line proof with two cases
theorem foo : P ∨ Q → R := by
  intro h
  cases h with
  | inl hp => ... 40 lines ...
  | inr hq => ... 40 lines ...

-- After: Two focused helpers + short main proof
private lemma foo_of_left (hp : P) : R := by ... 40 lines ...
private lemma foo_of_right (hq : Q) : R := by ... 40 lines ...

theorem foo : P ∨ Q → R := fun h => h.elim foo_of_left foo_of_right
```

#### Step 6: Check Definitions Too
Review ALL definitions in the file:
- Can they be simplified?
- Are they duplicating mathlib concepts?
- Should they use existing mathlib definitions instead?

### Decomposition Strategy
1. **Label sections by mathematical role**: setup, estimate, convergence, assembly
2. **Extract independent facts as helpers**: bounds, limits, constructions
3. **Name mathematically**: `norm_bound_of_continuous`, not `theorem_aux1`
4. **Minimize hypotheses**: weaker assumptions = more reusable lemmas
5. **Golf helpers aggressively**: isolated lemmas often become one-liners
6. **Consolidate shared logic**: same proof structure → parameterized helper
7. **Prefer mathlib**: if mathlib has it, use it; don't reinvent

### Helper Naming (Mathematical, not Structural)
```lean
-- Good: describes what it proves
private lemma norm_bound_of_continuous_on_compact : ...
private lemma limit_of_dominated_convergence : ...
lemma disjoint_balls_of_separated : ...  -- General, could be public

-- Bad: just references parent
private lemma big_theorem_aux1 : ...
private lemma step_2 : ...
```

### Helper Visibility
| Generality | Visibility |
|------------|------------|
| Very general, useful elsewhere | `lemma` (public) - consider if mathlib has it |
| Specific to this file's topic | `private lemma` |
| Only used once, can't generalize | `private lemma` with `_aux` suffix |

### Result
Main theorems should read as **clear outlines**:
```lean
private lemma continuity_bound : ‖f x‖ ≤ C := by ...
private lemma dominated_pointwise : ‖f_n x‖ ≤ g x := by ...

theorem main_result : ... :=
  limit_theorem (continuity_bound hf) (dominated_pointwise hg)
```

### Decomposition Checklist
For each proof >30 lines:
- [ ] Read and understand the complete proof
- [ ] List the independent mathematical steps
- [ ] Search mathlib for each step (`lean_loogle`, `lean_leansearch`)
- [ ] Identify cases/branches that could be separate lemmas
- [ ] For each potential helper: can it be generalized?
- [ ] Extract helpers with minimal, general hypotheses
- [ ] Name helpers mathematically (not `_aux1`, `_aux2`)
- [ ] Verify file compiles after each extraction
- [ ] Golf the extracted helpers
- [ ] Final main proof should be <15 lines

## Aggressive Mathlib Usage (CRITICAL)

**Rule: Use mathlib DIRECTLY. Do not create wrapper lemmas.**

### The Core Principle

**If mathlib has a lemma, USE IT DIRECTLY at call sites. Do NOT create a "convenience wrapper".**

A wrapper lemma like this is FORBIDDEN:
```lean
-- FORBIDDEN: This just wraps mathlib lemmas
lemma my_finite_lemma [DiscreteTopology S] (hK : IsCompact K) : Set.Finite (S ∩ K) := by
  haveI : DiscreteTopology (S ∩ K).Elem := DiscreteTopology.of_subset ‹_› Set.inter_subset_left
  exact hK.finite this
```

Instead, use the mathlib lemmas DIRECTLY where needed:
```lean
-- CORRECT: Use mathlib directly at the call site
theorem main_result ... := by
  ...
  haveI : DiscreteTopology (S ∩ K).Elem := DiscreteTopology.of_subset ‹_› Set.inter_subset_left
  have h_finite := (hK.inter_left hS_closed).finite this
  ...
```

### Why Wrappers Are Bad

1. **Duplication** - The wrapper duplicates mathlib's API
2. **Maintenance burden** - Another lemma to maintain
3. **Discovery problem** - Users won't find your wrapper; they'll find mathlib
4. **API bloat** - Adds noise to the namespace

### The Test

Before creating ANY lemma, ask:
1. **Is this just combining 1-3 mathlib lemmas?** → Don't create it, use mathlib directly
2. **Would someone searching mathlib find the same thing?** → Don't create it
3. **Is this providing genuinely new mathematical content?** → Maybe create it

### What IS Acceptable

- Lemmas that prove genuinely NEW mathematical facts not in mathlib
- Lemmas that require significant proof (>10 lines of non-trivial reasoning)
- Definitions for domain-specific concepts not in mathlib

Before creating ANY custom definition or hypothesis condition, search mathlib for an equivalent.
When found, use the mathlib version as a **type class or instance argument**, not a custom Prop.

### The Pattern

**BAD:** Custom condition as explicit hypothesis
```lean
-- Custom condition that duplicates mathlib
lemma foo (hS : ∀ s ∈ S, ∃ ε > 0, Metric.ball s ε ∩ S = {s}) : P := ...
```

**GOOD:** Mathlib type class as instance argument
```lean
-- Use mathlib's DiscreteTopology directly
lemma foo [DiscreteTopology S] : P := ...
```

### Why This Matters

1. **Avoids duplication** - Mathlib already has the concept; don't reinvent it
2. **Better API** - Instance arguments compose automatically
3. **More lemmas available** - Mathlib provides many lemmas about its own concepts
4. **Cleaner call sites** - Callers provide instance, not explicit proof

### Common Replacements

| Custom Condition | Use Instead |
|------------------|-------------|
| `∀ s ∈ S, ∃ ε > 0, ball s ε ∩ S = {s}` | `[DiscreteTopology S]` |
| `∀ s ∈ S, ∃ ε > 0, ∀ s' ∈ S, s' ≠ s → ε ≤ dist s s'` | `[DiscreteTopology S]` |
| `∀ x, f x ≤ g x` (for continuous f, g) | `hle : f ≤ g` with `[Preorder]` |
| Custom finiteness predicate | `[Finite S]` or `Set.Finite S` |
| Custom compactness predicate | `[CompactSpace X]` or `IsCompact S` |

### Recovering Properties from Type Classes

When you need specific properties that your custom condition provided, use mathlib's lemmas:

```lean
-- From DiscreteTopology, recover ball isolation:
obtain ⟨ε, hε_pos, hε_ball⟩ := exists_ball_inter_eq_singleton_of_mem_discrete hs

-- From DiscreteTopology, derive positive distance:
-- s' ∉ ball s ε means ε ≤ dist s' s, hence 0 < ‖s' - s‖
have h_pos : 0 < ‖s' - s‖ := by
  have h := exists_ball_inter_eq_singleton_of_mem_discrete hs
  ...
```

### Search Strategy for Mathlib Equivalents (EXHAUSTIVE)

**CRITICAL: Search MULTIPLE ways before concluding something isn't in mathlib.**

For each custom definition, lemma, or condition:

#### Step 1: Use Lean-Finder (AI-powered search) - BEST TOOL
```
https://huggingface.co/spaces/delta-lab-ai/Lean-Finder
```
Supports BOTH type signatures AND natural language queries. This is the most powerful search tool.

**Type signature queries:**
- `IsCompact s → DiscreteTopology s → s.Finite`
- `∀ x ∈ S, ∃ ε > 0, ball x ε ∩ S = {x}`

**Natural language queries:**
- "discrete topology inherited by subset"
- "compact set with discrete topology is finite"
- "intersection of closed and compact is compact"
- "ball isolation implies discrete"

#### Step 2: Search by type pattern (Loogle)
```bash
lean_loogle "DiscreteTopology → Set.Finite"
lean_loogle "IsCompact → DiscreteTopology → Finite"
lean_loogle "∀ x ∈ S, ∃ ε > 0, _"
```

#### Step 3: Search by natural language (LeanSearch)
```bash
lean_leansearch "discrete topology subset inherits discrete"
lean_leansearch "compact set with discrete topology is finite"
lean_leansearch "isolated points metric space"
```

#### Step 4: Grep mathlib directly
```bash
# Search for key terms
grep -r "DiscreteTopology.of_subset" .lake/packages/mathlib/
grep -r "IsCompact.finite" .lake/packages/mathlib/
```

#### Step 5: Check standard files
- Topology: `Mathlib/Topology/DiscreteSubset.lean`, `Topology/Compactness/*.lean`
- Metric: `Mathlib/Topology/MetricSpace/*.lean`
- Analysis: `Mathlib/Analysis/Normed/*.lean`
- Constructions: `Mathlib/Topology/Constructions.lean`

#### Step 6: Check for auxiliary lemmas
Often the exact lemma you need is a building block. Search for:
- `.of_subset`, `.subset`, `.inter` variants
- `_left`, `_right` variants
- `_of_*` implication variants

### Refactoring Checklist

When cleaning up a file:
- [ ] List all custom definitions/conditions
- [ ] For each, search mathlib for equivalent
- [ ] Replace custom conditions with mathlib type classes
- [ ] Update function signatures to use `[TypeClass X]` syntax
- [ ] Update all call sites
- [ ] Use mathlib's lemmas to recover specific properties
- [ ] Verify compilation after each change

### Example: DiscreteTopology Refactoring

**Before (25 lines) - WRONG: Custom lemma duplicating mathlib:**
```lean
lemma finite_of_discrete_inter_compact
    (hS : ∀ s ∈ S, ∃ ε > 0, Metric.ball s ε ∩ S = {s})
    (hS_closed : IsClosed S) (hK : IsCompact K) : Set.Finite (S ∩ K) := by
  have h_discrete : DiscreteTopology (S ∩ K).Elem := by
    rw [discreteTopology_subtype_iff']
    intro x ⟨hx_S, hx_K⟩
    obtain ⟨ε, hε_pos, hε_ball⟩ := hS x hx_S
    -- ... 15 more lines manually proving discrete ...
  exact (hK.inter_left hS_closed).finite h_discrete
```

**After - CORRECT: DELETE the lemma, use mathlib directly at call sites:**
```lean
-- The lemma finite_of_discrete_inter_compact is DELETED entirely.
-- At call sites, use mathlib directly:

theorem main_theorem ... := by
  ...
  -- Need finiteness? Use mathlib's IsCompact.finite + DiscreteTopology.of_subset:
  haveI : DiscreteTopology (S ∩ K).Elem := DiscreteTopology.of_subset ‹_› Set.inter_subset_left
  have h_finite := (hK.inter_left hS_closed).finite this
  ...
```

**Key mathlib lemmas to use DIRECTLY:**
- `DiscreteTopology.of_subset`: discrete topology inherits to subsets
- `IsCompact.finite`: compact + discrete → finite

### The Decision Tree

```
Is this lemma just combining mathlib lemmas?
├── YES (1-5 lines of mathlib calls) → DELETE IT, use mathlib directly
└── NO (genuinely new content) → Keep it, but search mathlib first
```

### Goal: ELIMINATE Wrapper Lemmas

- **Don't** create `my_foo` that just calls `Mathlib.foo`
- **Don't** create `foo_bar` that just calls `foo` then `bar`
- **Do** use mathlib's lemmas directly at every call site
- **Do** document which mathlib lemmas to use (in module docstring)

## Key Tactics for Golfing

**Goal: Minimize proof length.** One-liners are ideal. Brevity trumps readability.

### Deep Golfing Approach

For thorough optimization, use the **deep golfer** methodology:
1. Read the curated reference docs (`references/proof-patterns.md`, `references/pr-feedback-examples.md`)
2. Go through **every 3-5 lines** of each proof
3. Check each pattern against the catalogued anti-patterns and high-volume patterns
4. Try `lean_multi_attempt` on chunks with: `grind`, `aesop`, `simp_all`, `fun_prop`, `omega`, `ring`
5. Document which pattern each change matches

See `agents/deep-golfer-prompt.md` for the full deep golfer methodology.

### Quick Reference: Pattern Savings

| Pattern | Savings | Priority |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `by rfl` → `rfl` | 1 line | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| `by exact h` → `h` | 1 line | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| `fun x => f x` → `f` | Tokens | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| `rw; exact` → `rwa` | 50% | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Single-use `have` inline | 30-50% | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Multi-step → `grind` | 60-80% | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| `.trans` chains | 2-3 lines | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

### `fun_prop` for Analysis Properties
```lean
-- IMPORTANT: Unfold definitions first so fun_prop can see structure
example : Continuous F := by simp only [F]; fun_prop
example : Differentiable ℝ f := by simp only [f]; fun_prop
```

### `grind` for Case Analysis
```lean
-- Powerful automation for case analysis and Finset/card goals
example (hs : s.card = 1) : ∃ a, s = {a} := by grind
example : castSucc i ≠ 0 := by grind [castSucc_ne_zero_iff]
-- For distance/metric goals
example : dist a b < ε := by grind [Real.dist_eq]
-- For cardinality
example (h : n.primeFactors = ∅) : n ≤ 1 := by grind [Finset.card_eq_zero, primeFactors_eq_empty]
```

### `omega` for Arithmetic Goals (PREFERRED)
For impossible arithmetic/inequality goals (including `Fin` inequalities), **prefer `omega`** as the most direct tactic:
```lean
-- omega handles these directly
example (h : n < m) : n + 1 < m + 1 := by omega
example (i : Fin n) : i.val < n := by omega
example (h : a ≤ b) (h' : b < c) : a < c := by omega
```

### Other Power Tactics
- `ring` / `ring_nf` - Polynomial arithmetic
- `linarith` / `nlinarith` - Linear/nonlinear arithmetic
- `omega` - Integer/natural arithmetic (PREFERRED for arithmetic)
- `aesop` - Automated proof search
- `grind` - Powerful case analysis automation
- `exact?` / `apply?` - Find applicable lemmas

### Things Handled by Linters (Don't Comment On)
Mathlib's built-in linters catch these automatically - no need to fix manually:
- Long lines (>100 chars)
- Unused arguments/hypotheses
- Unused variables
These will be flagged at PR time; focus on semantic issues instead.

## File Splitting Guidelines

When a file exceeds ~1500 lines, use `/split-file` to split it.

### Splitting Strategy

**Step 1: Group by naming prefix**
Declarations about the same object share naming prefixes:
- `cauchyPrincipalValue*` → `CauchyPrincipalValue.lean`
- `residue*`, `Residue*` → `Residue.lean`
- `integral_*` → `Integration.lean`

**Step 2: Choose structure based on size**

For 1500-3000 lines:
```
Module/
├── Basic.lean      -- Definitions + core lemmas
└── Theorems.lean   -- Main results (imports Basic)
```

For >3000 lines:
```
Module/
├── Defs.lean       -- Pure definitions
├── GroupA.lean     -- Lemmas about object A
├── GroupB.lean     -- Lemmas about object B
└── Main.lean       -- Main theorems (imports all)
```

**Step 3: Respect dependencies**
- Lower files import higher files, never vice versa
- No circular imports
- Each file must compile independently

### Example Split

```
Before: ResidueTheory.lean (3000 lines)

After:
ResidueTheory/
├── CauchyPrincipalValue.lean  -- PV definitions & lemmas
├── Residue.lean               -- Residue definitions & lemmas
└── ResidueTheorem.lean        -- Main theorems (imports above)
```

## Reference docs are the propagation channel

Workers read `references/style-rules.md`, `references/naming-conventions.md`,
`references/proof-patterns.md`, `references/pr-feedback-examples.md`, etc. directly.
Community contributions land via `/contribute` PRs and propagate into these reference
docs through `/integrate-learnings`. There is no RAG, no MCP-server-backed search;
the reference docs are the single source of truth and the skill activates them
through the standard file-pattern triggers above.
