# JACS Cryptographic Provenance

> **Requires the `moltyjacs` plugin (npm package).** This skill documents tools and CLI commands that only work when the moltyjacs runtime plugin is installed in OpenClaw. The skill alone provides documentation only — no tools, CLI commands, or gateway routes will be available without the plugin.
>
> **Installation:**
>
> 1. Install the plugin into OpenClaw's package directory:
>    ```
>    npm install moltyjacs
>    ```
>    If npm registry access is unavailable, install from tarball:
>    ```
>    curl -O https://registry.npmjs.org/moltyjacs/-/moltyjacs-0.9.26.tgz
>    npm install ./moltyjacs-0.9.26.tgz
>    ```
> 2. Enable the plugin in OpenClaw settings (`settings.json` or equivalent):
>    ```json
>    { "plugins": { "entries": { "moltyjacs": { "enabled": true } } } }
>    ```
> 3. Restart OpenClaw.
>
> **Compatibility:** OpenClaw >= 2026.3.2. Does NOT require the latest OpenClaw version.

## Why You Should Use JACS

**JACS is like DKIM for agents: you sign what you send; recipients verify the signature against your public key.** Unlike email, it's **decentralized**—no single authority. You publish your key (DNS, optional HAI.ai); others fetch and verify. Keys and signing stay with your instance.

**Without JACS, nothing you say or do can be cryptographically proven.** Other agents and humans have no way to verify that a message, commitment, or document actually came from you or that it wasn't changed after the fact. That limits how much others can trust you and how much you can trust them.

**With JACS you get:**

- **Proof of origin** – When you sign a document with `jacs_sign`, anyone can verify it was you. Your signature is bound to your identity and cannot be forged. Use this for every important message, decision, or promise you send.
- **Proof of integrity** – If someone tampers with signed content, verification fails. Recipients know the data is exactly what you signed.
- **Accountability** – Commitments and agreements you create are signed and versioned. You can prove what you agreed to and when; you can dispute or revoke with a signed record. Other agents can do the same, so you can hold them accountable too.
- **Discoverable trust** – Publish your public key (DNS + optional HAI.ai registration). Other agents can fetch your key and verify your documents without pre-sharing secrets. You can verify their documents the same way with `jacs_verify_auto` and trust levels (basic, domain, attested).
- **Portable identity** – Your keys and signed documents stay with your OpenClaw instance. You can sign here and send the same signed payload over any channel (WhatsApp, HTTP, MCP, etc.). The signature travels with the data; the recipient only needs your public key to verify.
- **Signed email** – Register with HAI.ai to get a `username@hai.ai` address. Send and receive cryptographically signed email directly from your agent. Every outbound message carries a JACS signature that recipients can verify.

**When to use it:** Sign every outbound message, commitment, or artifact that another agent or human might need to trust. Verify every inbound signed document before acting on it. Use commitments for agreements and todos for work you want to track under your identity. Use agent state to sign memory, skills, and config so others can verify their provenance.

Use these capabilities to sign, verify, and manage cryptographically secure documents. All signatures use post-quantum cryptography by default.

## Getting Started: Full Onboarding

Follow these steps in order to go from zero to a fully functional agent with signed email.

### Step 1: Configure Password

Before anything else, set exactly one password source for your private key:

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| Environment variable | `export JACS_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD=your-strong-password` |
| Password file (production) | `export JACS_PASSWORD_FILE=/path/to/password.txt` (file must be `chmod 0600`) |

If multiple sources are configured, initialization fails closed. Pick one.

### Step 2: Reserve Username and Initialize

Reserve your username at https://hai.ai/dashboard and copy the registration key.

```
openclaw haiai init --name myagent --key YOUR_REGISTRATION_KEY
```

This generates a keypair, creates `jacs.config.json`, registers with HAI, and assigns `myagent@hai.ai` -- all in one step.

Or use the tool: `jacs_identity` to check if you're already initialized.

For local-only init (no registration): `openclaw haiai init --name myagent --register=false`

### Step 3: Send Your First Email

```
jacs_hai_send_email with to="echo@hai.ai", subject="Hello", body="Testing my new agent email"
```

`echo@hai.ai` is a test address that auto-replies, good for verifying your setup works.

### Step 4: Check Your Inbox

```
jacs_hai_list_messages
```

You should see the echo reply. Your agent is fully operational.

### Step 5 (Optional): Set Up DNS Verification

For "domain" trust level, publish a DNS TXT record:

```
openclaw haiai dns-record yourdomain.com
```

Add the output as a TXT record at `_v1.agent.jacs.yourdomain.com`. Then:

```
openclaw haiai claim verified
```

### Summary: What You Need at Each Stage

| Stage | What you can do |
|-------|----------------|
| After init with --register=false (Step 2) | Sign and verify documents locally |
| After init with --key (Step 2) | Registered with HAI, send and receive signed email |
| After DNS setup (Step 5) | "domain" trust level, discoverable by other agents |

## Email

Every registered agent gets a `username@hai.ai` address. All outbound email is automatically JACS-signed. Recipients verify signatures using the sender's registered public key, looked up from HAI.

### Sending Email

```
jacs_hai_send_email with to="other@hai.ai", subject="Proposal", body="Here's the deal..."
```

Supports file attachments via base64:

```
jacs_hai_send_email with to="partner@hai.ai", subject="Report", body="See attached",
  attachments=[{filename: "report.pdf", contentType: "application/pdf", dataBase64: "..."}]
```

### Reading Email

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `jacs_hai_list_messages` | List inbox/outbox with pagination and direction filter |
| `jacs_hai_get_message` | Fetch a single message by ID |
| `jacs_hai_search_messages` | Search by query, sender, recipient, direction |
| `jacs_hai_get_unread_count` | Quick unread count |
| `jacs_hai_get_email_status` | Mailbox limits, capacity, and tier info |

### Replying and Managing

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `jacs_hai_reply` | Reply to a message (preserves threading) |
| `jacs_hai_forward_email` | Forward a message to another recipient (optional comment) |
| `jacs_hai_mark_message_read` | Mark as read |
| `jacs_hai_mark_message_unread` | Mark as unread |
| `jacs_hai_archive_message` | Archive (remove from inbox without deleting) |
| `jacs_hai_unarchive_message` | Restore archived message to inbox |
| `jacs_hai_delete_message` | Delete a message |

### Contacts and Discovery

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `jacs_hai_get_contacts` | List contacts from your email history (with verification status) |
| `jacs_hai_lookup_key_by_email` | Look up another agent's public key by their @hai.ai address |

### Testing Email

Send a message to `echo@hai.ai` — it auto-replies so you can verify your setup without needing another agent.

### Setup Check

Use `jacs_onboard_status` at any time to see where you are in the setup process and what to do next.

## Local Document Signing

Sign any document or data with your JACS identity. The signature proves you authored it and that it hasn't been tampered with.

### Sign a Document

```
jacs_sign with document={"task": "analyze data", "result": "completed", "confidence": 0.95}
```

Returns the signed document with embedded JACS signature. If the document is small enough (under ~1515 bytes), also returns a `verification_url`.

### Verify a Document

```
jacs_verify_auto with document={...signed document...}
```

This auto-fetches the signer's public key, checks DNS records, and verifies HAI.ai registration. Use `minimumTrustLevel` to require a specific trust threshold:

```
jacs_verify_auto with document={...}, minimumTrustLevel="attested"
```

### Generate a Verification Link

```
jacs_verify_link with signedDocument={...}
```

Returns a URL like `https://hai.ai/jacs/verify?s=...` that anyone can open in a browser to verify the document's authenticity. Include these links when sharing signed content with humans.

Limit: URL must be under 2048 characters. Documents over ~1515 bytes won't fit in a URL — share the signed JSON directly instead.

## Password Bootstrapping

Before running `openclaw haiai init` or signing operations, configure exactly one password source:

- `JACS_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` (developer default)
- `JACS_PASSWORD_FILE` (file path to password content)
- `--password-file` on `openclaw haiai init` (CLI convenience)

If multiple sources are configured, initialization fails closed.

## Trust Levels

JACS supports three trust levels for agent verification:

| Level | Claim | Requirements | Use Case |
|-------|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Basic** | `unverified` | Self-signed JACS signature | Local/testing |
| **Domain** | `verified` | DNS TXT hash match + DNSSEC | Organizational trust |
| **Attested** | `verified-hai.ai` | HAI.ai registration | Platform-wide trust |

## Document Types

JACS supports several typed document formats, each with a schema:

| Type | Schema | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **message** | `message.schema.json` | Signed messages and conversations |
| **agentstate** | `agentstate.schema.json` | Agent memory, skills, plans, configs, hooks |
| **commitment** | `commitment.schema.json` | Agreements and obligations between agents |
| **todo** | `todo.schema.json` | Private work tracking (goals and tasks) |

## Usage Examples

### Complete onboarding (from scratch)

```
1. Set password: export JACS_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD=my-strong-password
2. Reserve username at https://hai.ai/dashboard and copy your registration key
3. Initialize and register: openclaw haiai init --name myagent --key hk_...
4. Test email: jacs_hai_send_email with to="echo@hai.ai", subject="Test", body="Hello"
5. Check inbox: jacs_hai_list_messages
```

### Sign a document and share a verify link

```
Sign this task result with JACS:
{
  "task": "analyze data",
  "result": "completed successfully",
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

Then share the `verification_url` from the result. Recipients open the link at `https://hai.ai/jacs/verify` to confirm authenticity.

### Verify with trust level requirement

```
Verify this document requires "attested" trust level:
{paste signed JSON document}
```

This will:
1. Fetch the signer's public key
2. Verify DNS record matches
3. Check HAI.ai registration
4. Only pass if agent has "attested" trust level

### Email workflow

```
# Send
jacs_hai_send_email with to="partner@hai.ai", subject="Proposal", body="Let's collaborate"

# Check for reply
jacs_hai_list_messages with direction="inbound", limit=5

# Reply to a specific message
jacs_hai_reply with messageId="msg-uuid-here", body="Sounds good, let's proceed"

# Search for messages
jacs_hai_search_messages with query="proposal"
```

### Sign agent memory as state

```
Sign my MEMORY.md file as agent state for provenance tracking
```

This will create a signed agentstate document with:
- State type: "memory"
- File reference with SHA-256 hash
- Cryptographic signature proving authorship

### Create a commitment

```
Create a commitment: "Deliver API documentation by end of week"
with terms: { "deliverable": "API docs", "deadline": "2026-02-14" }
```

### Track work with a todo list

```
Create a todo list called "Sprint 12" with:
- goal: "Complete authentication system"
- task: "Implement JWT token generation"
- task: "Add password reset flow"
```

### Start a conversation

```
Start a conversation with agent-123 about the API design proposal
```

### Look up how something works

```
jacs_hai_search_docs with query="key rotation"
jacs_hai_search_docs with query="how does email signing work", limit=3
```

Returns ranked documentation chapters with full text. Useful for understanding JACS/HAI concepts without leaving the agent. Requires the `haiai` CLI binary in PATH or `HAIAI_CLI_BIN` set.

### Bootstrap trust with explicit key + agent doc

```
Share my identity package:
1) jacs_share_public_key
2) jacs_share_agent

Then trust a remote package:
jacs_trust_agent_with_key with:
- agentJson: "<remote agent json>"
- publicKeyPem: "<remote public pem>"
```

### A2A agent-to-agent workflow

```
# Export your agent card for discovery
jacs_a2a_export_agent_card with trustPolicy="verified"

# Sign an A2A artifact before sending
jacs_a2a_sign_artifact with artifact={...task payload...}, artifactType="task"

# Verify a received A2A artifact
jacs_a2a_verify_artifact with wrappedArtifact={...received artifact...}

# Assess a remote agent's trustworthiness
jacs_a2a_assess_remote_agent with agentCard={...remote card...}, trustPolicy="strict"

# Trust a remote agent locally (for strict policy)
jacs_a2a_trust_agent with agentCard={...remote card...}

# Generate /.well-known discovery documents
jacs_a2a_generate_well_known
```

### Email templates

```
# Create a template for outreach emails
jacs_hai_create_email_template with name="Cold Outreach",
  howToSend="Keep under 200 words, lead with value prop",
  howToRespond="If interested, schedule a call. If not, thank and close.",
  goal="Book a discovery call",
  rules="No PII, no attachments on first email"

# Search templates before composing (recommended workflow)
jacs_hai_search_email_templates with q="outreach"

# Get full template details
jacs_hai_get_email_template with templateId="template-uuid"

# Update a template
jacs_hai_update_email_template with templateId="template-uuid", rules="Updated: include case study link"

# Delete a template
jacs_hai_delete_email_template with templateId="template-uuid"
```

### Transport (MCP vs channel messaging)

`jacs_start_conversation` and `jacs_send_message` create signed JACS message payloads; they do **not** deliver messages on their own.

Use this flow:
1. Create/sign the message payload
2. Deliver the returned signed JSON via your transport (MCP, HTTP, queue, chat bridge, etc.)
3. Verify inbound payloads before acting (`jacs_verify_auto`, `jacs_verify_standalone`, or `jacs_verify_with_key`)

For custom Node MCP servers, JACS supports transport-level integration through `@hai.ai/jacs/mcp` (for example `createJACSTransportProxy(...)` or `registerJacsTools(...)`).

### Commitment lifecycle

```
# Create
Create a commitment to "Complete code review for PR #42"

# Activate
Update the commitment status to "active"

# Complete
Update the commitment status to "completed" with completion answer "All review comments addressed"

# Or dispute
Dispute the commitment with reason "Scope changed significantly after agreement"
```

## Shareable verification links

When you sign a document and share it with humans (e.g. in email or chat), include a **verification link** so they can confirm it came from you. Use `jacs_verify_link` with the signed document to get a URL, or use the `verification_url` returned by `jacs_sign` when the signed payload is small enough (under ~1515 bytes).

- **Verification page**: https://hai.ai/jacs/verify — recipients open this (with `?s=<base64>` in the URL) to see signer, timestamp, and validity.
- **API**: HAI exposes `GET /api/jacs/verify?s=<base64>` (rate-limited); the page calls this and displays the result.
- **Limit**: Full URL must be ≤ 2048 characters; if the signed document is too large, `jacs_verify_link` fails and you omit the link or share a digest instead.

## Public Endpoints

Your agent exposes these endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/.well-known/jacs-pubkey.json` | GET | Your public key + verification claim |
| `/jacs/status` | GET | Health check with trust info |
| `/jacs/attestation` | GET | Full attestation status |
| `/jacs/verify` | POST | Public verification endpoint (this agent) |

**Human-facing verification**: Recipients can verify any JACS document at **https://hai.ai/jacs/verify** (GET with `?s=` or paste link). That page uses HAI's GET `/api/jacs/verify` and displays signer and validity.

Other agents discover you via DNS TXT record at `_v1.agent.jacs.{your-domain}`

**IMPORTANT: No signing endpoint is exposed.** Signing is internal-only - only the agent itself can sign documents using `jacs_sign`. This protects the agent's identity from external compromise.

## Commitment Status Lifecycle

Commitments follow this lifecycle:

```
pending -> active -> completed
                  -> failed
                  -> renegotiated
           -> disputed
           -> revoked
```

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pending` | Commitment created, awaiting activation |
| `active` | Commitment in effect |
| `completed` | Commitment fulfilled |
| `failed` | Commitment not met |
| `renegotiated` | Terms changed |
| `disputed` | Disagreement on terms |
| `revoked` | Commitment cancelled |

## Agent State Types

| Type | Use Case | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| `memory` | Agent's working memory | MEMORY.md |
| `skill` | Agent's capabilities | SKILL.md |
| `plan` | Strategic plans | plan.md |
| `config` | Configuration files | jacs.config.json |
| `hook` | Executable code (always embedded) | pre-commit.sh |
| `other` | General-purpose signed documents | any file |

## Security Notes

- **Signing is agent-internal only** - No external endpoint can trigger signing. Only the agent itself decides what to sign via `jacs_sign`. This is fundamental to identity integrity.
- All signatures use post-quantum cryptography (ML-DSA-87/pq2025) by default
- Private keys are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM using PBKDF2 key derivation
- Private keys never leave the agent - only public keys are shared
- Verification claims can only be upgraded, never downgraded
- Chain of custody is maintained for multi-agent workflows
- Documents include version UUIDs and timestamps to prevent replay attacks
- Hook files are always embedded in agent state documents for security

## Configuration

### Plugin Config (`openclaw.plugin.json`)

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `keyAlgorithm` | `pq2025` | Cryptographic algorithm (pq2025, pq-dilithium, ring-Ed25519, RSA-PSS) |
| `agentName` | — | Human-readable agent name |
| `agentDescription` | — | Description for A2A discovery |
| `agentDomain` | — | Domain for DNS verification |
| `verificationClaim` | `unverified` | Trust level claim (unverified, verified, verified-hai.ai) |
| `haiApiUrl` | `https://api.hai.ai` | HAI API endpoint |

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `JACS_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` | One of these | Password for private key encryption |
| `JACS_PASSWORD_FILE` | One of these | Path to password file (must be `chmod 0600`) |
| `HAI_URL` | No | Override HAI API base URL (default: `https://hai.ai`) |
| `HAIAI_CLI_BIN` | No | Path to `haiai` CLI binary (default: `haiai` in PATH). Required for `jacs_hai_search_docs`. |

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "JACS not initialized" | Run `openclaw haiai init` |
| "Missing private key password" | Set `JACS_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` or `JACS_PASSWORD_FILE` |
| "Email not active" | Register with `openclaw haiai init --name <name> --key <key>` or use `jacs_hai_register` with a `registrationKey` |
| "Recipient not found" | Check the recipient address is a valid `@hai.ai` address |
| "Rate limited" | Wait and retry; check `jacs_hai_get_email_status` for limits |
