  Design the technical solution for a non-trivial Odoo change BEFORE code is written - the design step
  between requirement analysis (odoo-brl / odoo-gap-analysis) and coding (odoo-coding). Dispatches the
  odoo-solution-architect agent to produce a gate-able Technical Design Document grounded in OSM. Use it
  to decide HOW to build (inheritance axis, stored vs computed, new module vs extend) - not just WHAT to
  build or to immediately WRITE code. Fire on: "how should I architect/structure this", "design the
  solution / data model", "which approach", "plan the refactor", "technical design". Vietnamese: "thiết kế
  giải pháp", "phân tích thiết kế", "chọn cách tiếp cận nào", "lên kế hoạch refactor". For ONE method's
  hook use odoo-override-finding; to WRITE code use odoo-coding; to REVIEW use odoo-code-review; to
  classify a requirement LIST use odoo-brl / odoo-gap-analysis; for the build ORDER of an approved design
  use odoo-planning; for usage/walkthrough scenarios use odoo-doc-walkthrough
---

## Where this sits in the flow (design precedes the code Plan Mode)

Planning/analysis step only. Output: `.odoo-ai/designs/…` (gitignored, L1) - never production
source. Correct order:

```
design (architect writes the TDD)  →  HUMAN approves the design  →  Plan Mode for the code  →  code → review
```

The approved TDD is the plan the code Plan Mode executes; do not flip this order.

## Input port - gap-analysis artifact (read before designing)

Before the Phase 0 preview, look for a gap-analysis artifact on disk - the per-requirement
classification/effort is the design PRECONDITION, read it; do NOT re-derive the tier from
conversational text:

- **Glob** `.odoo-ai/gap-analysis/*/gap-matrix.jsonl` (newest dir wins); the consultant path
  may instead carry BRL output under `.odoo-ai/brl/*/` - accept either source.
- **Found:** READ it. Each `gap-matrix.jsonl` line is one requirement with keys `req_id` ·
  `requirement` · `coverage` (full|partial|none) · `classification`
  (standard|config|extension|custom) · `effort_tier` (S|M|L|XL) · `module` · `grounded` ·
  `notes`. Use `classification` + `effort_tier` per requirement to decide WHICH requirements
  need a TDD and at what depth (extension/custom + L/XL drive the design; standard/config with
  a single obvious approach skip DESIGN and route straight to `odoo-planning` instead - planning
  is mandatory for all work, see "Skip DESIGN for trivial work" below). Cite the artifact path in the
  Phase 0 preview and pass it to the architect (`GAP_MATRIX:` line in the P1 template). When
  the artifact exists it is authoritative - do NOT re-derive tiers from memory.
- **Not found AND the change is non-trivial:** recommend running `odoo-gap-analysis` first to
  classify/cost the requirements rather than guessing the tier. (Trivial single-approach
  change: proceed without it.)

## Phase 0 - Design intent gate (1-turn gate)

**Exception: when `return_to` is set**, SKIP this Phase 0 scope-preview gate entirely. The
caller (e.g. `odoo-forward-port`) has already classified scope and approved entering the design
step. Go straight to the architect dispatch (Agent invocation - prompt template below) and
then the single design-approval gate after the architect returns.

**Default (no `return_to`):** Before invoking the agent, emit a concise **design scope
preview**, then **stop** for confirmation. The preview names what the design will decide and
which artifact it produces - it does NOT write production code (this is a read-only design step):

```
Design scope: <one-line of the change to be designed>
Will decide:  approach (inherit axis / new vs extend) · data model · override strategy ·
              module structure · sequencing · test outline · risks · platform-principles
              (multi-company/branch, localization strategy, app-menu) · bidirectional
              (upstream+downstream) impact · dynamic demo-data plan
Artifact:     .odoo-ai/designs/<slug>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md (design doc, no production code)
OSM:          backed | standalone
Proceed? (yes / refine: [feedback] / cancel)
```

Wait for the user's reply before proceeding. This gate is the single mandatory checkpoint for
the default (no `return_to`) path and applies even on a direct (intake-bypass) entry. It is a
**preview, not a write-block** - on confirmation the architect writes ONLY the design doc under
`.odoo-ai/`, never source files.

**Multi-module scope heuristic.** Before emitting the preview, check for these qualitative
signals - a cluster of them suggests master-child decomposition is worth offering:
- Multiple independent modules each needing a new model or new inheritance axis.
- Independent business domains where sub-designs are mostly orthogonal.
- Several Custom-XL / Extension-L items (from `odoo-brl` / `odoo-gap-analysis`) referencing
  different module entry points and sharing a non-trivial cross-module contract.

Module enumeration priority (first available): deep-survey `synthesis.md` → brl `dag.json`
→ modules-upgrade `graph.md` → fallback: scan `__manifest__.py` + topo-sort `depends`
(pattern: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/odoo-modules-upgrade/SKILL.md` § P1(a)).

When the heuristic fires, replace `Proceed? (yes / refine: [feedback] / cancel)` with:

```
Proceed?
  approve-master-child  - one master TDD + one child TDD per module (see Decompose branch)
  approve-single / yes  - flat TDD covering full scope (default; use when in doubt)
  refine: [feedback]    - clarify scope first
  cancel
```

Default is `approve-single` / plain `yes`. Show `approve-master-child` only when the heuristic
fires - never for a single-module or narrowly-scoped design.

**`approve-single` / plain `yes`:** MUST set `MODE: single` in the architect dispatch brief (P1
template). Without this explicit field, the architect's decompose-bounce heuristic may re-evaluate
scope as multi-module, return `NEEDS_NEXT`, and loop instead of writing the TDD.

---

## Decompose branch (master-child mode)

Only entered when the user replied `approve-master-child` at Phase 0.
Contract SSOT: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/master-child-design-contract.md`.
Artifact root: `.odoo-ai/designs/<master-slug>/`.

**a. Master TDD dispatch.** Dispatch `odoo-solution-architect` with `MODE: master`. Architect
produces `_master-<date>.md` (cross-module altitude: §10 shared-symbol registry, dep directions,
integration-module decisions - NOT module internals) and `index.yaml` (per contract schema).
Use same prompt template as P1 below; add `MODE: master`.

**b. Master gate (human, MANDATORY).** Present master TDD summary: §10 symbol count, dep order,
top cross-module risks. Gate: `approve-master` (default) / `review-master` (opt-in - dispatch
`odoo-solution-architect MODE: review` for a fresh-spawn adversarial pass over the master TDD,
then re-present this gate with its FINDINGS) / `refine: [feedback]` / `cancel`. No child dispatch
before this clears. The approved master §10 is the hard constraint for all children.

**c. DAG fan-out (child TDDs) - base-first by `dag_layer`.** After master gate:
- Read `dag_layers` from `index.yaml` (topo order is encoded in list order). `dag_layer` is the
  SHARED axis for both concurrency and dependency: same layer = parallel, different layer =
  strict order. Dispatch `odoo-solution-architect` `MODE: child` per module, following **Mode B**
  (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/concurrency-guard.md`) for the same-layer batch. ALL
  children of layer `k` must reach `designed` (see checkpoint step below) before ANY child of
  layer `k+1` is dispatched - never mix layers in one dispatch batch.
- Dispatch order only, not the §10 contract mechanism: the master §10 shared-symbol registry still
  front-loads every cross-module contract (step a), so no child blocks on a sibling for interface
  discovery. Base-first reduces `MODE: consistency` rework by catching §10 gaps against a concrete
  lower-layer design early.
- **Model floor: opus.** Scale toward fable for modules with a new inheritance axis (same
  fable-confirmation rule as single mode).
- Layer-0 child brief includes `MODE: child`, `CHILD_MODULE: <name>`, `MASTER_DESIGN_DOC: <abs
  path>`, `ODOO_VERSION: <version>`. Every layer `k>=1` child brief additionally carries
  `UPSTREAM_CHILD_DESIGNS: [<abs path to each already-authored lower-layer child TDD it
  depends_on>]` ALONGSIDE `MASTER_DESIGN_DOC`. Child cites master §10 for every cross-module
  symbol it references.
- When dispatching a same-layer batch of >1 child, inject `PEERS: <other child names in this
  batch>` into each child brief - you (the orchestrating skill) are the address authority for this
  lead-brokered list. A lone-child layer gets `PEERS: none`. Full contract:
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/master-child-design-contract.md` § Peer reconciliation.
- After each child subagent returns, YOU (the orchestrating main agent) write `status: designed`
  for that module to `index.yaml` (checkpoint for resume on interruption) - confirm every module
  in the current layer is `designed` before dispatching the next layer's batch.

**d. Consistency pass (MANDATORY after all children `designed`).** Dispatch
`odoo-solution-architect` `MODE: consistency`. Reads CONTRACT SUBSET of each child (§1 Intent,
§9 Acceptance Criteria - confirming each child carries its own MANDATORY module-level AC block with
the INDEPENDENCE GUARD honored (expected values requirement-derived, never code/OSM-derived) -
cross-module fields/models/deps - NOT full body) + master §10. CONSUMES the peer-reconciled child
TDDs (each peer having recorded its agreed contract in its own TDD per
`master-child-design-contract.md` § Peer reconciliation) and is the SOLE §10/`index.yaml` applier -
children never write §10 themselves. Reconciles any remaining seams, emits `conflict-list.md`
(split RESOLVED-BY-PEERS vs ESCALATED) at the artifact root.

**e. Batch gate (human, single gate for all children).** Present conflict-list split into ESCALATED
seams (the human decides these - the only seams needing a decision; MANDATORY - state explicitly if
none) and RESOLVED-BY-PEERS seams (informational, state the count only) + per-child TDD summaries
(approach, top risk, data-model delta). Gate: `approve-all` (default) / `review-children` (opt-in -
dispatch `odoo-solution-architect MODE: review` over the domain-close child clusters that sit on the
same dependency chain, then re-present this gate with FINDINGS) / `refine:<module>: [feedback]` /
`cancel`. A `refine:<module>` re-dispatches that child only, re-runs consistency pass, then
re-presents this gate. One batch gate total - escalated seams fold INTO this single gate, never a
separate gate. On `approve-all`, write `status: approved` for all modules in `index.yaml`.

**f. Continuation Contract (master-child).** Emit per
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/continuation-contract.md`. All paths are repo-root-relative;
`child_path` under `design_docs` MUST be the full repo-root path (not relative to subdir):

```yaml
status: NEEDS_NEXT
next: <return_to or odoo-planning>
inputs:
  design_index: .odoo-ai/designs/<master-slug>/index.yaml
  master_design_doc: .odoo-ai/designs/<master-slug>/_master-<date>.md
  design_docs:
    - module: <name>
      child_path: .odoo-ai/designs/<master-slug>/<name>-<date>.md
```

Do NOT emit bare `design_doc:` (single-mode only). Do NOT put `design_index` /
`master_design_doc` / `design_docs` as bare top-level keys - they belong under `inputs:`.
`next:` same rule as single mode: `return_to` SET → `next: <return_to>`; UNSET →
`next: odoo-planning` (the planner consumes `index.yaml` `dag_layers` and batches the modules into
a wave-batched execution plan before any code is written - it is the first consumer of the design
DAG; the coders later follow the plan's module/wave order rather than `dag_layers` directly).

---

## Role

Odoo solution architect. Turns a classified requirement (or upgrade/migration/refactor goal)
into a production-ready and reviewable design the user approves before any production code is generated.
Pairs with `odoo-coding` (consumes the design) and `odoo-code-review` (checks implementation vs design).

## When to invoke - and the non-trivial threshold

Launch `odoo-solution-architect` as a subagent for **non-trivial** changes. Fire for ANY of:

- **Extension-L / Custom-XL** tier (from `odoo-brl` / `odoo-gap-analysis`).
- **A new module**, new model, or module restructure.
- **Overriding a core ORM hook** (`create` / `write` / `unlink`) or a method with ≥3 entries
  in its override chain.
- **A schema / data migration** with more than one viable strategy.
- **A cross-model computed chain**, multi-company / multi-currency / multi-branch (v17+), or a
  full-stack feature spanning backend + frontend.
- **A localization touch** needing a generic-before-localization decision, or a new
  `application=True` module needing the standard app-menu shape (root + Reports + Configuration).
- **A refactor** (mixin extraction, module split/merge, inheritance axis change).

The architect surveys **bidirectional impact** and designs **dynamic demo data** for any new
end-user behavior - see `agents/odoo-solution-architect.md` for the template.

**Skip DESIGN for trivial work:** a single Standard/Config field, boilerplate (one computed field,
a view shell, a security CSV row), or a localized fix with exactly one obvious approach - but still
route to `odoo-planning`, because planning is mandatory for all work
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/planning-gate-contract.md` § Mandatory-planning rule). If unsure:
"this looks like a one-approach change - design it first, or plan it directly?"

## Out of Scope

- **Writing production code** → `odoo-coding` (backend Python/XML + frontend JS/OWL/SCSS)
- **Reviewing existing code** → `odoo-code-review`
- **Finding ONE method's hook location** → `odoo-override-finding` (this skill designs the whole
  solution; override-finding answers a single "where do I hook" question)
- **Classifying / costing a requirement list** → `odoo-brl` (large) or `odoo-gap-analysis` (short)
- **Version-to-version API delta** → `odoo-version-diff`; **deprecation scan** → `odoo-deprecation-audit`
- **User workflow narrative or happy-path usage scenarios for documentation** -> `odoo-doc-walkthrough`. This skill designs technical architecture BEFORE code; it does NOT author user-facing walkthrough text or scenario docs

## MCP tools

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED TOOLS -->
> **Pick the right tool first.** Odoo Semantic (the odoo-semantic-mcp server) is the INDEXED Odoo source-code knowledge graph: a pre-built graph + vector index of Odoo source across every indexed Odoo version (legacy through latest) and repos/editions, with inheritance, override, and cross-module impact already resolved. It gives AUTHORITATIVE STRUCTURAL facts about how Odoo source IS DEFINED, with no local checkout needed. Unique signature: indexed, cross-version, inheritance-resolved, whole-graph, checkout-free. It is a STATIC index with NO runtime/live data.
>
> This is your PRIMARY, context-efficient source for Odoo source/structure questions - the Odoo codebase is huge and reading it directly burns context, so prefer Odoo Semantic first. Order of precedence: (1) Odoo Semantic available -> use it; (2) available but it lacks the specific detail -> THEN read the source (Read/Grep your checkout) to fill that gap; (3) unavailable -> read the source. Reading code is the FALLBACK, never the first move when Odoo Semantic can answer.
>
> Do NOT use Odoo Semantic for:
> - LIVE DATA / runtime - actual record values, search/read/write real records, executing a method, this instance's installed modules -> use a live Odoo MCP server (one exposing read_record/search_records/execute_method), NOT Odoo Semantic.
>
> Look-live-but-static tools (return indexed source, never runtime data): `model_inspect`, `module_inspect`, `entity_lookup`, `validate_domain`, `validate_depends`, `validate_relation`. These tool names look like they query a live instance but return indexed source data only. If you need live records, Odoo Semantic is the wrong server.

**Session bootstrap** (call once at session start):
- `set_active_version(odoo_version='17.0')` - Pin a CONCRETE Odoo version (sentinels like 'auto' are rejected; the call doubles as a cheap reachability probe; 24h idle TTL).

**Primary tools:**
- `model_inspect` ★ - Superset inspection of an ORM model: enumerate or fully describe fields, methods, views, extenders, or a summary in one call.
- `entity_lookup` ★ - Single-entity drill-down by ID: field, method, or view with full inheritance chain and source module.
- `find_override_point` - Show override chain, super() safety guidance, and anti-patterns for a method to find the safest place to inject custom behavior.
- `impact_analysis` - Risk assessment of changing or removing a field, method, or model: blast radius, dependent modules, and downstream fields.
- `suggest_pattern` - Find curated Odoo design patterns from the catalogue with gotchas and anti-patterns.
- `find_examples` - Semantic code search returning real indexed code snippets from the Odoo codebase.
- `resolve_orm_chain` ⊕ - Walk a dotted ORM field path hop by hop to the terminal field type or the exact hop where it breaks.
- `validate_depends` ⊕ - Validate compute method's `@api.depends('a.b', ...)` paths; flag `id` and suggest typos.
- `validate_domain` ⊕ - Validate search domain terms: field-path resolution and operator version-awareness.
- `validate_relation` ⊕ - Assert a relational field points at the expected comodel (many2one/one2many/many2many).
- `lookup_core_api` - Verify Odoo core API symbol signature, status (stable/deprecated/removed), and replacement.
- `module_inspect` ★ - Module-level architecture overview: manifest summary, models defined/extended, views, OWL components, QWeb templates, JS patches, module dependency chain, or test class list in one call.
- `check_module_exists` - Verify module availability, edition (CE/EE/Viindoo), and cross-version presence.
- `api_version_diff` - Structured diff of an API symbol or scope across two Odoo versions: new, changed, removed, deprecated items.
- `profile_inspect` - Profile-level introspection discriminator (ADR-0028): inspect a tenant profile's composition in one call.
- `find_test_examples` - Semantic search for Odoo test code examples (test_method, test_class, js_test chunks only - never returns production code).
- `test_base_classes` - Menu of official Odoo test framework base classes (TransactionCase, HttpCase, SavepointCase, Form, etc.) for the given version, with test_type and cursor contract.
- `test_coverage_audit` - Audit an entire module for test coverage gaps: lists fields/methods with zero COVERS_* edges (never referenced by any test).
- `tests_covering` - List test methods that have COVERS_MODEL/COVERS_FIELD/COVERS_METHOD edges to the target model or field (static reference coverage, not runtime executed coverage).

## Brief context

The design doc is a **contract for the coders**. Eight fixed sections (Intent & Business Value,
Approach, Data model, Override strategy, Module structure, Sequencing, Test strategy outline, Risks)
are specified in `agents/odoo-solution-architect.md` (Round 4 is the SSOT for the doc template).

For full-stack design, ground the frontend approach in the **fidelity** contract
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/odoo-frontend-fidelity.md`. Full reference (doc structure,
frontend-design sources, key failure modes prevented):
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/odoo-solution-design/references/brief-context.md`

### Test strategy grounding (§7) - when to use which test tool

Section §7 "Test strategy outline" is the highest-leverage output of the TDD: every downstream
agent (odoo-test-writing, odoo-qa-planner, odoo-coder) inherits the base classes and behavior list
it specifies (odoo-qa-planner turns it into the independent acceptance oracle under odoo-acceptance;
odoo-qa-suite reuses it only as a static release test-plan, never to execute or adjudicate). The architect uses four test tools - already visible in `## MCP tools` below - at
specific moments in the design rounds:

| Tool | When in the rounds | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `test_base_classes(odoo_version='<version>')` | Round 0 HARD RULE, before writing any test class name | Returns authoritative `TransactionCase` / `HttpCase` / `SavepointCase` / `Form` menu for the pinned version + always outputs **`cr.commit()` FORBIDDEN** contract. Never assert a base class from memory. |
| `find_test_examples(query='<feature>', odoo_version='<version>')` | Round 1, call #5, parallel with `find_examples` | Returns ONLY test chunks (no production code). Seeds the workflow-path shapes that populate §7 rows. Use instead of `find_examples` whenever the intent is to find test patterns. |
| `tests_covering(model='<model>', odoo_version='<version>')` | Round 2, immediately after `impact_analysis` | Lists test methods that already COVER the target model/field/method. Zero model-level edges = unguarded behavior that §7 must add. Non-zero = existing protection (no need to duplicate). Edge count goes in the Impact matrix and §7 "Already covered?" column. **Caveat:** method-narrow (`method=`) and field-narrow (`field=`) calls frequently return zero edges even for well-tested code because COVERS_METHOD / COVERS_FIELD edges are sparse; prefer the model-level call as the primary signal and treat method-narrow zero as supporting evidence only. |
| `test_coverage_audit(module='<module>', odoo_version='<version>')` | Round 4, first step before filling §7 rows | Audits the whole module for zero-coverage fields (field-level static-reference; method gaps are NOT reported - use `tests_covering` with `method=` to probe a specific method, but expect sparse results). Each field gap surfaced here that the design introduces or modifies MUST appear as a new test row in §7. |

**Invariant:** §7 is only valid if all four tools were called during the design rounds AND - when
the design covers more than one module - the table is PARTITIONED PER MODULE (a `### <module>`
subheading per row of §1's per-module table, mandatory even in single-mode multi-module TDDs). A §7
written from memory (no `test_base_classes` call) or pooled across modules with no per-module
partition is a design defect - the wrong base class or an unowned behavior row in the TDD flows
verbatim into test code.

## Agent invocation - prompt template (P1)

When composing the dispatch prompt for any specialist agent you dispatch, fill the caller-side
skeleton in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/dispatch-brief.md` (read it by path) plus the target
agent's family delta; never inline that file verbatim into a hard-leaf brief.

When the user confirms intent (Phase 0 gate passed), launch `odoo-solution-architect` as a subagent.
Use the template below **verbatim**, filling the bracketed placeholders.

**Model per dispatch** - set as the subagent `model` parameter (the `DISPATCH MODEL` line
records the tier chosen; both must match):
- **opus** - default for every design.
- **fable** - ONLY for Custom-XL tier or a design spanning >=3 modules full-stack with a new
  inheritance axis. Requires explicit human confirmation (state tier, cost, and why). If
  declined or unavailable, fall back to **opus** and note in the TDD header
  (`dispatch: opus (fable declined/unavailable)`).

```
DISPATCH MODEL: <opus|fable>
You are the odoo-solution-architect agent. Produce an Odoo Technical Design Document (NOT
production code) for the following change:

REQUEST: [full requirement/goal, with target model(s), Odoo version, any constraints. For the
classification/effort tier, prefer the GAP_MATRIX file below over a pasted tier string - the
architect reads it per requirement]

GAP_MATRIX: [omit this line entirely when absent; otherwise the gap artifact path found by the
Input port - .odoo-ai/gap-analysis/<slug>-<date>/gap-matrix.jsonl, or the BRL results dir
.odoo-ai/brl/<job-id>/. The architect READS this for the authoritative per-requirement
classification/effort_tier - do NOT also flatten the tier into REQUEST as free text]

RETURN_TO: [omit this line entirely when absent; set to the caller skill name (e.g.
odoo-forward-port) when the caller requests return routing after design approval]

DESIGN_SLUG_HINT: [omit when absent; short slug the caller wants used for the design doc
filename, e.g. account-move-fp-18 - the architect uses this as the <slug> when writing
.odoo-ai/designs/<slug>-<date>.md]

Step 0 (ONLY if mcp__odoo-semantic__* tools are available): call
set_active_version('<version>'), then proceed through your design rounds. If OSM is
unavailable, use the Standalone-first fallback (disk-grounded: Read/Grep the repo). If OSM
is reachable but a SPECIFIC module/model in this request is not in the index (a
customer-local custom module), that is a Tier-1 MISS, not proof of absence: keep OSM for
everything it covers and Read/Grep the local addons for just the missed entities, grounding
the design hybrid (grounded: osm + local-source (hybrid)). Do NOT
design from memory when OSM is reachable.

Follow your system-prompt rounds. Write the design doc to .odoo-ai/designs/<slug>-<date>.md.
Do NOT write any production source files. Do NOT spawn subagents or invoke skills.
```

The agent runs its rounds using its restricted read-only tool allowlist. It does NOT spawn
subagents, invoke skills, or write production code.

### Payload mapping when `return_to` is set (caller-return flow)

When a caller (e.g. `odoo-forward-port`) supplies `return_to`, map its payload
(`target_version` / `modules` / `classification` / `intent_records` / `design_slug_hint` /
`return_to`) onto the P1 architect dispatch template per the field-by-field table in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/odoo-solution-design/references/return-to-payload.md` - do NOT
improvise or drop a field, and never flatten `intent_records` into the classification summary
(it carries the behavioral contract the design must honour, distinct from the structural
classification). The default (no `return_to`) path skips this entirely.

## Standalone-first fallback

When OSM is unreachable: architect `Read`/`Grep`s module source (field lists, method signatures,
manifest `depends`), labels doc `grounded: local-source (not OSM-indexed)`. When OSM is
reachable but a specific module is not in the index (customer-local addon): OSM for what it
covers, local source for missed entities, doc labeled `grounded: osm + local-source (hybrid)`.
Only when the repo itself is inaccessible: fall back to memory, label `OSM unavailable -
ungrounded`. Three-tier grounding SSOT: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/disk-fallback-protocol.md`.
Escalate (`NEEDS_CONTEXT`) only for business decisions no source encodes - never to ask a human
to paste code or manifests.

## Agent-managed tools

This skill is part of an agent+skill bundle. See `agents/odoo-solution-architect.md` for the
full restricted (read-only) tool list and execution detail.

## Design-approval gate (who approves: the human)

When the architect returns the TDD, **do NOT auto-chain to coding.** Present a tight summary
(chosen approach + rationale, data-model/override headlines, top risk, pointer to the full doc),
then gate. Write the gate message in the USER'S LANGUAGE (translate labels and prose; keep file
paths, module names, and model identifiers verbatim):

```
Design ready: .odoo-ai/designs/<slug>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md
Intent: <one line - what this solves and why>   ·   Business value: <one line>
Approach: <one line>   ·   Top risk: <one line>
Modules:
  | module | new/modified | intent | expected outcome | business value |
  | <m1>   | new          | <...>  | <observable>     | <...> |
  | <m2>   | modified     | <...>  | <observable>     | <...> |
Approve design? (approve / refine: [feedback] / cancel)
```

- `refine: [feedback]` → re-dispatch the architect with the feedback; rewrite the same doc.
- `approve` → ONLY NOW does the chain move on. Two branches:
  - **`return_to` is UNSET (default standalone flow):** hand off to `odoo-planning` to turn the
    approved design into the execution plan (module order + integration cadence + lifecycle
    wiring); `odoo-planning` owns the code Plan Mode and the plan wires `odoo-coding` (each coding
    wave landed by `run-harness`'s between-wave integration) per its plan. (Migration carve-out: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/planning-gate-contract.md` § Migration carve-out - single-module scripts only; THIS skill owns that front-door routing decision, no executor re-validates it.)
  - **`return_to` is SET (caller-return flow):** do NOT enter a code Plan Mode and do NOT
    dispatch any coder. Emit the Continuation Contract (see below) with `next: <return_to>`
    and hand control back to the caller. The caller (e.g. `odoo-forward-port`) owns the
    downstream Plan Mode and code dispatch.
- `cancel` → stop; the design doc remains on disk for later.

Optional assist (does not replace human approval): for an independent opinion on DESIGN
SOUNDNESS (not code-vs-design conformance), dispatch `odoo-solution-architect MODE: review` (see
the Decompose branch's `review-master` / `review-children` gate keywords for master-child mode;
for single mode, invoke it directly on the design doc) - a fresh-spawn adversarial pass that never
authored this design. Do NOT use `odoo-code-review` for this: it checks that CODE conforms to the
approved design, not whether the design itself is sound. The human still makes the approval call
either way.

## Continuation Contract

When the bundle finishes, append a Continuation Contract block per
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/continuation-contract.md` (status / produced / next). The `next`
is **gated on the human design-approval above** - the driver dispatches the next step only after
the design is approved. Choose `next` as follows:

- **`return_to` is SET:** emit `next: <return_to>` (e.g. `next: odoo-forward-port`). Include
  in `inputs`: `design_doc: <path>` only. Do NOT emit a coder target. The caller recovers
  everything else (module names, branches, versions) from its own checkpoint; only the design
  doc path needs to cross the boundary. The caller resumes with the approved design doc and
  runs its own Plan Mode.
- **`return_to` is UNSET (default):** for a backend, frontend, or full-stack design emit
  `next: odoo-planning` (the planner turns the approved design into the wave-batched execution
  plan before any code is written); for a migration design that meets the Migration carve-out
  (single-module script, single `dag_layer`) emit `next: odoo-data-migration` (or `odoo-coding`)
  directly - a front-door routing decision THIS skill owns, per
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/snippets/planning-gate-contract.md` § Migration carve-out (no executor
  re-validates on arrival); any richer (multi-module/multi-layer) design goes through `odoo-planning`.
  Each carries `design_doc: <path>` so the next step builds on the approved design.

- **Master-child mode (`approve-master-child` path):** see Decompose branch § f above. Emit
  `design_index` / `master_design_doc` / `design_docs` - NOT bare `design_doc:` (single-mode only).

Additive output for the run-harness - it does not change anything produced above.
