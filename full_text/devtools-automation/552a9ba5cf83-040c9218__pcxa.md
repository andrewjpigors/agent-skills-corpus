# PCXA CLI

**Tool:** `pcxa`

All commands output JSON by default. Use `-f table` for human-readable. Use `--dry-run` on write operations. Run `pcxa <command> --help` for full options.

When installed as a Claude Code plugin, `pcxa` is provided by the plugin `bin/` directory. For direct terminal use outside Claude Code, ask the user to install it once with:
```
pipx install git+https://github.com/PCX-Analytics/pcxa-skill.git
```
Then `pcxa update` self-upgrades from GitHub. The CLI prints a one-line notice to stderr (max once per 24h) when a newer release is available.


## Setup & Authentication

Always start by running `pcxa whoami` to see the current state. The output tells you whether the user is authenticated and whether a project is set. Only run setup steps that are actually missing.

### Step 1 — Authentication (drive it yourself, don't punt to a terminal)

If `whoami` says "No profiles configured" or a command fails with "Profile not found":

```bash
pcxa login --no-setup
```

The `--no-setup` flag is required when you (the agent) drive login: it skips the interactive company/project picker that reads stdin, which would otherwise hang. The CLI prints two lines immediately:

```
Opening browser to authenticate...
  If your browser does not open automatically, visit:
  https://www.pcxa.app/auth/cli-auth?port=PORT&state=STATE
```

**Read those lines from stdout, then surface the URL to the user as a clickable markdown link.** The CLI tries `webbrowser.open()` but that's usually a no-op in WSL/headless — the user opening the link manually is the normal path. They sign in (MFA/SSO supported), the page redirects to a localhost callback, the CLI captures tokens, the command exits.

Run with a generous bash timeout (e.g., 180s) since the user may take a moment to sign in. The CLI's own `--timeout` defaults to 120s; pass `--timeout 300` if you want longer.

If browser login isn't viable (rare — only if the host can't reach `pcxa.app`), fall back to password login: `pcxa setup -u USER_EMAIL` (prompts for password — only works if the user can run it themselves).

### Step 2 — Pick a project

After login (or if `whoami` shows `Project: not set`), drive the project picker yourself:

```bash
pcxa projects -f table       # list all (company_id, project_id) the user has access to
```

Show that list to the user, ask which project they want, then:

```bash
# When the conversation/CWD is inside a repo that maps 1:1 to a PCXA project,
# pin it locally so future runs in this repo are auto-scoped:
pcxa set-project PROJECT_ID --company COMPANY_ID --local

# Otherwise, set the global default for this user:
pcxa set-project PROJECT_ID --company COMPANY_ID
```

Always pass `--company` when picking — `--local` writes a `.pcxa` file in CWD; without `--local`, the choice is saved in the global profile.

### How resolution works

Project scope resolves in this order: **repo `.pcxa` file** > **active profile default**. `.pcxa` is committed (no secrets — just `{ "company": 4, "project": 10, "user": "alice@example.com" }`). Different repos can pin different accounts via the `user` field; the CLI matches it against profile usernames in the active credentials file.

Credentials resolve **folder-first**: a `.pcxa-credentials.json` found by walking up from CWD is used for both reads and writes (token refresh included); otherwise the global `~/.pcxa/credentials.json` is used. So `pcxa login` from inside a repo writes that repo's own `.pcxa-credentials.json` (at the git root, gitignored) and can't clobber another repo's tokens — pass `--global` to write the shared global file instead. Pre-0.3 global creds at `~/.file_explorer/config.json` are auto-migrated to `~/.pcxa/credentials.json` on first run.

State to surface to the user on the first turn: `whoami` shows `Active profile`, `User`, `Company`, `Project` (with `(from .pcxa)` annotation when applicable), `Creds:`, and `Repo pin:`. If you ran setup steps, echo the resulting scope back ("Operating on project Acme Tower (4)") so the user can correct you before any writes.

## Project Metadata

```bash
pcxa project get                                              # view project details
pcxa project members                                          # list members (name → user ID)
pcxa project members --search "John"                          # search by name/username
pcxa project update --name "New Name"                         # update name
pcxa project update --description "..." --scope-statement "..." # set description & scope
pcxa project update --code "T-FAB1" --industry "Construction" # set code & industry
pcxa project update --start-date 2025-12-03 --end-date 2026-08-10
pcxa project update --rollup-method equal                     # equal|duration|cost|labor
pcxa project update --progress-input-method percentage        # status|percentage
```

Fields: `name`, `code` (max 20), `description`, `scope-statement`, `industry`, `life-cycle`, `start-date`, `end-date`, `progress-input-method`, `rollup-method`.

## File Search & Reading

```bash
pcxa files list --ext PDF --search "keyword" --limit 50  # title trigram (fuzzy by default; exact first)
pcxa files list --search "concret" --exact               # tight substring only — `concret` will NOT match `Concrete`
pcxa files list --tags "urgent,review" --tags-mode all   # AND: files with ALL tags
pcxa files search "natural language query"                    # hybrid BM25 + semantic (same endpoint as the web UI)
pcxa files search "query" --scope file,activity               # restrict source types (csv: file,activity,drawing,photo)
pcxa files search "query" --ext PDF --limit 25                # narrow to file type, page-size up to 50
pcxa files content "BRG report" --ext PDF                     # alias of `files search` scoped to files (same hybrid endpoint)
pcxa files read FILE_ID --outline                             # section map
pcxa files read FILE_ID                                       # first 5 chunks
pcxa files read FILE_ID --start 5                             # next window
pcxa files batch-read 423 511 612 --window 3                  # multi-file in one call
pcxa files batch-read --chunk 423:7 --chunk 511:12            # excerpts at specific chunks
pcxa files batch-read 423 511 --outline                       # outlines, multi-file
pcxa files info FILE_ID                                       # metadata + versions
pcxa files stats                                              # project-wide counts
pcxa files aggregate file_type                                # group by dimension
pcxa files recent --limit 30
pcxa files download FILE_ID                              # download to current dir
pcxa files download FILE_ID -o report.pdf                # custom output path
pcxa files upload /path/to/file.pdf --folder 5 --title "Report" --tags "final,2026"
pcxa files upload /path/to/dir/ --folder 5               # bulk upload all files in dir (flat)
pcxa files sync /path/to/tree --folder 5                 # recursive mirror; creates subfolders; idempotent
pcxa files sync /path/to/tree --folder 5 --manifest .pcxa-sync.json   # persist upload log for fast re-runs
pcxa files sync /path/to/tree --folder 5 --include "*.pdf" --exclude "draft_*" --concurrency 16
pcxa files delete 123 124 --yes                          # mark for deletion (adds 'to_delete' tag)
pcxa files restore 123 124                               # remove 'to_delete' tag (undo)
pcxa files list --tags to_delete                         # list everything pending deletion
```

**Upload storage:** Small files are uploaded through the API. Larger files use a presigned upload flow handled by the CLI and API.

**Bulk tree sync (`files sync`):** Mirrors a local directory tree under a PCXA folder. Walks the tree, creates any missing subfolders to match, and uploads files in parallel via the same presign+PUT/multipart path as `files upload`. Idempotent two ways: it lists each target folder once and skips local files whose name already exists there, and an optional `--manifest <path>` persists `{relative_path → {size, file_id}}` so re-runs skip without hitting the API. Failures (network, register errors) are listed at the end and counted toward `error` rate. Progress is rendered live on stderr: a bar plus files-done, bytes-done/total, throughput, current concurrency (`c=N`), elapsed, ETA, and error count. Filters: `--include` and `--exclude` accept repeatable globs against filenames; dotfiles/dot-dirs are skipped by default (`--include-hidden` opts in).

**Designed for TB-scale runs:**
- **Auto-tuning concurrency** (default ON): an AIMD controller samples throughput and error rate every 10s and adjusts active workers via a runtime-resizable semaphore. Errors halve concurrency with a 30s cooldown; clean windows with rising throughput step it up. Bound by `--min-concurrency` / `--max-concurrency` (default 1 / 32). Pass `--no-auto-tune` to pin concurrency at `--concurrency` for the whole run. Tuner decisions print above the progress line so you can see what's happening.
- **Failure-budget circuit breaker** (`--max-failures`, default 100): aborts the run cleanly if cumulative errors hit the budget, so a misconfigured target folder doesn't burn hours of bandwidth. Set `0` to disable.
- **Pre-flight folder check**: `GET /folders/{id}/` runs before walking, so an inaccessible target ID fails fast instead of mid-run.
- **Adaptive multipart part-size**: per-file `part_size` is bumped automatically if the file would exceed R2's 10000-part cap (relevant for files > ~160 GB at the 16 MB default).
- **Time-based manifest checkpoints**: manifest flushes every 50 uploads *or* every 30s, whichever comes first — a crash mid-run loses at most ~30s of progress.
- **Resume messaging**: when the manifest already has entries, the run prints "Resuming from manifest: N files already recorded." up front.
- **`--part-concurrency`** (default 4) decouples parts-per-file parallelism from files-in-flight parallelism, so 16 concurrent multipart files don't spawn 16 × 16 = 256 PUTs.
- **`--limit N`** stops after queueing N files (post-filtering). Useful for graduated smoke tests before committing to a multi-hour run; the manifest is still written so the next run resumes exactly where this one stopped.

**Deletion convention:** `pcxa files delete <ids>` marks files for deletion by applying the `to_delete` tag. Use `pcxa files restore <ids>` to undo before cleanup runs. Without `--yes`, `delete` prompts for confirmation.

Search results include `url` fields — always show these to users for document links.

**`--search` is fuzzy by default (`files list`, `files aggregate`, `activities list`).** Backend uses PostgreSQL trigram similarity: exact substring matches surface first (similarity ~1.0), then typo-tolerant matches ranked by similarity DESC, in a single paginated response. `concret` finds `Concrete Pour`; `0314` ranks `RFI-0314` above `Document-031499`. Pass `--exact` to opt back into tight substring matching (rejects typos — useful when the query is a known-correct identifier and you don't want fuzzy noise). The backend rate-limits fuzzy search to 100/min per user; not normally a concern for agent use.

**Search response shape:** `pcxa files search` returns `{query, total_results, results, hybrid_enabled}` — a top-N reranked list (server-capped at 50). Each row carries `score`, `file_id`/`activity_id`, `file_name`/`title`, `folder_path`, `page_number`, `chunk_position`, and a `url`. Hybrid means the result is the union of Pinecone semantic similarity and BM25 over the project's chunk text, RRF-fused and Cohere-reranked — the same path the web UI's search bar uses.

**After search → read in batch.** Once `files search` returns the rows, prefer `files batch-read --chunk file_id:chunk_position` over N single `files read` calls. Each row carries a `chunk_position` — pass `file_id:chunk_position` as `--chunk` to read just the relevant excerpt + neighbors. One round trip instead of N. Use `--outline` for section maps when files are large and you need to plan further reads.

For folder-scoped browsing, use `pcxa files list --folder <id>`.

## Tags & Folders

```bash
pcxa tags list                                                # all tags with counts
pcxa tags add 1 2 3 --tags urgent,review                      # add (preserves existing)
pcxa tags remove 1 2 --tags draft                             # remove specific tags
pcxa tags set 1 2 --tags final,approved                       # replace all tags
pcxa tags bulk --file plan.json                               # different tags per file, one request
pcxa files bulk-patch --file plan.json                        # per-file metadata plan (tags + title/category/description)
pcxa folders tree --depth 2                                   # hierarchy
pcxa folders create "Contracts" --parent 5                    # new folder
pcxa folders rename 5 "Legal"                                 # rename
pcxa folders move 5 --parent 10                               # reparent
pcxa folders contents 5                                       # subfolders + files (paginated; --timeout for slow folders)
pcxa folders subfolders 5                                     # lightweight [{id,name}] list (fast on large folders)
pcxa folders delete 5                                         # delete + all contents
pcxa move 10 11 12 --folder 5                                 # bulk move files
pcxa categorize 10 11 --category "Submittal"                  # bulk set category
pcxa files update 10 --title "New" --tags a,b --folder 5      # single file update
```

**Bulk tag/metadata plans (`files bulk-patch`, `tags bulk`):** `tags add/remove/set` apply the *same* tag set to a list of file ids. When each file needs *different* tags (or you're patching metadata exported from a spreadsheet), use the server-side `files/bulk_patch/` endpoint instead of one request per file — up to 500 rows per request, auto-chunked for larger plans, per-row validated so one bad row doesn't fail the batch. Output reports `patched`, `modified` (rows that actually changed), and `failed` (per-row errors).

`files bulk-patch --file plan.json` takes a JSON list of rows (or `{"changes": [...]}`), each row `{file_id, ...}` setting any subset of `title`, `category`, `description`, `tags` (with optional `tag_mode` ∈ `set`|`add`|`remove`, default `set`):

```json
{"changes": [
  {"file_id": 123, "tags": ["reviewed", "urgent"], "tag_mode": "add"},
  {"file_id": 124, "tags": ["legal"]},
  {"file_id": 125, "title": "ACME-0001.pdf", "category": "Contracts", "description": "Q3 amendment"}
]}
```

`tags bulk --file plan.json` is the tag-only view of the same endpoint — rows are `{file_id, tags, tag_mode}` and scalar fields (title/category/description) are rejected with a pointer to `files bulk-patch`. `folder` is not patchable via either command (folder moves recompute privacy/aggregates — use `pcxa move`). Empty `tags` in `set` mode is refused client- and server-side to prevent an accidental mass tag-wipe; use `tag_mode: remove` to clear specific tags. Add `--dry-run` to preview the plan without sending. Both are `bulk_patch`-backed; the older `tags add/remove/set` and `bulk_update` path is now set-based server-side (pmapp2 #1265) but unchanged for callers.

## Activities

```bash
pcxa activities list --status in_progress --priority 3,4
pcxa activities list --search "foundation" --assignee 5 --sort -due_date  # fuzzy by default; add --exact for tight
pcxa activities list --tags "structural,review" --tags-mode all  # AND mode
pcxa activities list --after 2026-03-01 --before 2026-03-31       # updated in date range
pcxa activities list --after last_month                          # relative dates supported
pcxa activities list --created-after 2026-01-01 --created-before 2026-03-31
pcxa activities list --assignee 5 --after 2026-03-01 --before 2026-03-31  # user's work in period
pcxa activities get 123                                       # detail + steps + deps
pcxa activities create --title "Review" --priority 3 --type 5 --assignees 1,2
pcxa activities create --title "Pour slab" --custom-fields '{"3":"Acme Corp"}'  # custom-object value, fuzzy-validated
pcxa activities update 123 --status completed --percent 100
pcxa activities update 123 --custom-fields '{"3":"Acme Corp"}' --no-fuzzy        # write value as-is
pcxa activities delete 123 456                                # bulk delete
pcxa activities bulk-update 1 2 3 --status in_progress
pcxa activities types                                         # list templates
```

**Statuses:** `not_started`, `in_progress`, `completed` | **Priority:** 0=none, 1=low, 2=med, 3=high, 4=critical

**Descriptions support Markdown** (headings, tables, bold, lists). Keep descriptions focused on:
- **Scope/objective** — what the activity is and what it produces
- **Requestor** — who asked for it, with reference to source communication (e.g., `file:247764`)
- **Business justification** — why this work exists

Do NOT put in descriptions: processing details, scripts, output file lists, status updates, or progress notes. Those belong in **comments** (`pcxa comments add`) as dated narrative entries.

**Date filters:** `--after`/`--before` filter by last updated; `--created-after`/`--created-before` filter by creation date. Accepts `YYYY-MM-DD` or relative keywords: `today`, `last_7_days`, `this_month`, `last_quarter`, etc.

**Name resolution:** `--assignee` and `--owner` accept user IDs or names. Names are fuzzy-matched against project members:
- Exact/substring match → resolves automatically with confirmation message
- Multiple close matches → lists candidates with IDs for you to pick
- No match → suggests `pcxa project members` to list all

**Custom-object fields:** `--custom-fields` takes a JSON map of `{custom_field_id: value}` (custom fields are defined at the project level). Values targeting a custom-object-backed field are fuzzy-validated the same way form submissions are — see **Custom Objects**. Pass `--no-fuzzy` to write the raw value.

**Invoicing workflow:** Query a user's activity in a billing period by name — no `--status` filter needed since `--after`/`--before` captures any work (started, progressed, or completed):
```bash
pcxa activities list --assignee "John" --after 2026-03-01 --before 2026-03-31
```

## Steps (Subtasks)

When steps exist, activity progress auto-calculates from weighted step completion.

```bash
pcxa steps list 123                                           # list steps
pcxa steps create 123 --name "Draft review" --weight 40
pcxa steps update 123 45 --percent 100                        # mark step complete
pcxa steps delete 123 45                                      # weights rebalance
pcxa steps from-template 123                                  # create from type template
```

## Progress

```bash
pcxa progress list 123                                        # progress timeline
pcxa progress add 123 --percent 50 --notes "Halfway"
pcxa progress add 123 --percent 25 --date 2026-03-15          # backdate
pcxa progress delete 123 789                                  # manual entries only
```

## Comments

```bash
pcxa comments list 3712                                       # list comments on activity
pcxa comments add 3712 --content "[2026-03-16] Drafting initiated..."
pcxa comments delete 3712 2952                                # delete comment by ID
pcxa comments bulk 3712 --file comments.json                  # bulk add from JSON file
```

**Bulk JSON format** (`comments.json`):
```json
[
  {"content": "[2026-03-16] Drafting initiated per weekly report #12"},
  {"content": "[2026-03-23] Internal review completed, minor revisions needed"}
]
```

Supports both bare list and wrapper object with `"comments"` key.

## Dependencies (CPM)

Types: `FS` (finish-to-start), `SS`, `FF`, `SF`. Lag in days (negative = lead).

```bash
pcxa deps list --predecessor 10
pcxa deps create --predecessor 10 --successor 20 --type FS --lag 2
pcxa deps delete 456
```

## Gantt & WBS Tree

```bash
pcxa gantt --status in_progress
pcxa tree --max-depth 3
```

## Forms (Templates)

Form templates define reusable forms with typed fields. Submissions are instances of a form.

```bash
pcxa forms list --category Safety                     # list templates
pcxa forms list --scope project --search "inspection"
pcxa forms get 1                                      # detail + fields
pcxa forms create --name "Safety Inspection" --category Safety --code-prefix SI --code-padding 3
pcxa forms update 1 --description "Updated desc" --reviewers 3,5
pcxa forms delete 1
```

**Scope:** `project` (default) or `company`. **Code settings:** `code-prefix` (e.g. RFI), `code-scope` (project/company), `code-separator` (default: -), `code-padding` (3=001).

## Fields (Form Fields)

Fields define the structure of a form template. Field values are referenced by field ID in submissions.

```bash
pcxa fields list 1                                    # list fields for form 1
pcxa fields create 1 --label "Inspector" --type text --required --order 1
pcxa fields create 1 --label "Severity" --type select --options '{"choices":["Low","Med","High"]}'
pcxa fields create 1 --label "Date" --type date --required --order 2
pcxa fields create 1 --label "Vendor" --type choice --choice-id 21      # custom-object-backed
pcxa fields update 1 5 --label "New Label" --required true
pcxa fields delete 1 5
```

**Field types** (exact set): `text`, `textarea`, `number`, `date`, `datetime`, `checkbox`, `select`, `radio`, `choice`, `table`, `photo`, `file`, `location`.
- `select`/`radio`: inline options via `--options '{"choices":["A","B"]}'`.
- `choice`: backed by a **custom object** (field-choice) — bind with `--choice-id <object_id>`; submission values are fuzzy-validated (see **Custom Objects**).
- `table`: a repeating grid of typed columns — see **Table fields** below.

### Table fields

A `table` field holds a list of rows, each with the same typed columns. **The columns go in `table_schema` (a JSON array), NOT `--options`** — the CLI exposes a dedicated `--table-schema` flag for this. `--options` is silently accepted by the API but ignored by the forms UI, so a table defined via `--options` renders with no columns.

```bash
pcxa fields create 1 --label "Line Items" --type table --required \
  --table-schema '[
    {"name":"item","field_type":"text","label":"Item"},
    {"name":"qty","field_type":"number","label":"Qty"},
    {"name":"unit","field_type":"select","label":"Unit","options":["ea","lf","sf"]}
  ]' \
  --min-rows 1 --max-rows 20
```

- Each column needs a **`name`** (the key used in submission values), a **`field_type`**, and a **`label`**. Column `name` keys must be stable — submission row values are keyed by them.
- `--min-rows` / `--max-rows` bound the row count (optional).
- `pcxa fields list 1` and `pcxa forms get 1` show a table field's columns (`cols: item, qty, …`) and a choice field's binding (`custom-object 21`).

## Submissions (Form Submissions)

Submissions are instances of a form template, with field values keyed by field ID.

```bash
pcxa submissions list --form 1                        # list for a specific form
pcxa submissions list --status draft                  # filter by status
pcxa submissions get 1 42                             # detail (form_id submission_id)
pcxa submissions create 1 --code SI-001 --values '{"1":"John","2":"2026-03-24","3":"High"}'
pcxa submissions update 1 42 --values '{"3":"Critical"}' --merge --tags urgent  # change only field 3
pcxa submissions delete 1 42
```

**Statuses:** `draft`, `submitted`, `closed`. `--values` is a JSON object mapping **field ID → value**. The value shape depends on the field type:

| Field type | Value shape | Example (`"3"` = field ID) |
|---|---|---|
| text/number/date/select/radio/choice | scalar | `{"3":"High"}`, `{"3":42}` |
| checkbox | boolean | `{"3":true}` |
| table | **array of row objects keyed by column `name`** | `{"3":[{"item":"Rebar","qty":50},{"item":"Concrete","qty":12}]}` |

For a **table** field, each row is an object whose keys are the column `name`s from the field's `table_schema`. Example creating a submission with a 2-row table in field `7`:

```bash
pcxa submissions create 1 --code SI-002 \
  --values '{"7":[{"item":"Rebar","qty":50,"unit":"lf"},{"item":"Concrete","qty":12,"unit":"sf"}]}'
```

> ⚠️ **The API does NOT validate value shapes.** It accepts a wrong shape (a scalar where a table is expected, rows keyed by the wrong names, a `{"rows":[…]}` wrapper, etc.) without error — but the forms UI then renders the field broken. Match the field type and the column `name`s exactly. Use `pcxa fields list <form_id>` to confirm a table field's columns before submitting.

> ⚠️ **`update --values` replaces the entire values dict by default.** Passing a partial `--values` (e.g. just `{"3":"Critical"}`) clears every other field on the submission. Pass **`--merge`** (alias `--patch`) to update only the keys you supply, leaving the rest intact. Without `--merge` the CLI prints a one-line overwrite warning to stderr.
>
> **`--merge` works at field-ID granularity only — it cannot merge *within* a table value.** To change one cell or add one row, resend the field's **entire** row array: `pcxa submissions get` the current value, edit the array, and send it back under that field's key with `--merge`.

Values targeting a custom-object-backed (`choice`) field are fuzzy-validated on create/update — see **Custom Objects** below. Pass `--no-fuzzy` to skip. (Custom-object columns *inside* a table row are not yet fuzzy-validated — verify those values against the object's options yourself.)

## Custom Objects (Field Choices)

Custom objects are reusable, typed lookup tables (`field-choices` in the API). A custom object defines a `property_schema` (its columns — a JSON **list** of `{"name", "type"}` objects) and holds **options** (rows), each with a `label` and a `properties` JSON of column values. Form fields can be backed by a custom object so submissions pick from its options. Objects exist at **project** (default) or **company** scope; a company object can be surfaced into a project with `extend`.

```bash
pcxa custom-objects list                                    # project-scoped objects
pcxa custom-objects list --scope company --search vendor     # company-scoped, filtered
pcxa custom-objects get 5                                   # schema + first options
pcxa custom-objects create --name "Vendors" --schema '[{"name":"code","type":"text"}]'
pcxa custom-objects create --name "Trades" --scope company --extensible true
pcxa custom-objects update 5 --description "Approved vendor list"
pcxa custom-objects extend 5                                # company object → current project
pcxa custom-objects delete 5
```

### Options (rows)

```bash
pcxa custom-objects options list 5                          # rows of object 5
pcxa custom-objects options create 5 --label "Acme Corp" --properties '{"code":"A1"}'
pcxa custom-objects options update 5 42 --label "Acme Corporation" --order 1
pcxa custom-objects options delete 5 42
pcxa custom-objects options bulk-create 5 --file options.json   # [{"label":..,"properties":..}, ...]
pcxa custom-objects options reorder 5 --order "42,17,9"      # option ids in desired order
```

Pass `--scope company` to any object/option command when the object is company-scoped.

### Fuzzy matching ("did you mean?")

When a value should reference a custom object, the CLI fuzzy-matches it against that object's options:

```bash
pcxa custom-objects resolve 5 "Acme Crp"
# → No match for 'Acme Crp'. Did you mean 'Acme Corp' (option 10)?
```

`resolve` exits non-zero when there is no confident match. **Form submissions and activity custom fields run the same check automatically:** on `submissions create`/`update` with `--values` or `activities create`/`update` with `--custom-fields`, any value targeting a custom-object-backed field is validated — an exact label/id or a unique substring resolves silently; anything else blocks the write with a "Did you mean Y?" suggestion. Pass `--no-fuzzy` to write the raw value. Validation reads the field definitions (form fields, or activity custom fields at `activities/custom-fields/`) and the object's options (trying project then company scope); a permissions or network error degrades to a warning and never blocks an otherwise-valid write.

## Resources

Resources represent people, equipment, consumables, or subcontractors assigned to activities.

```bash
pcxa resources list --type personnel --active true
pcxa resources get 1                                  # detail with rates
pcxa resources create --name "John Smith" --type personnel --user 5
pcxa resources create --name "Crane #3" --type equipment --unit hours --capacity 10
pcxa resources update 1 --name "John D. Smith" --active false
pcxa resources delete 1
```

**Types:** `personnel`, `equipment`, `consumable`, `subcontractor` | **Units:** `hours`, `days`, `each`, `lump_sum`

Only `personnel` resources can link to a user (`--user`). Use `--user 0` to unlink.

## Rates (Resource Rates)

Append-only rate history. Create new rates with new effective dates — no updates/deletes.

```bash
pcxa rates list 1                                     # rates for resource 1
pcxa rates create 1 --effective-date 2026-04-01 --standard-rate 75 --cost-rate 50 --bill-rate 100
pcxa rates create 1 --effective-date 2026-04-01 --standard-rate 75 --cost-rate 50 --bill-rate 100 --overtime-rate 112.50
```

## Assignments (Resource → Activity)

```bash
pcxa assignments list 123                             # list for activity 123
pcxa assignments create 123 --resource 5 --planned-units 40 --role "Lead Engineer"
pcxa assignments create 123 --resource 8 --planned-units 80 --curve front_loaded --driving
pcxa assignments update 123 45 --remaining 20 --at-completion 50
pcxa assignments delete 123 45
```

**Curves:** `uniform`, `front_loaded`, `back_loaded`, `bell`

## Cost Codes (Company-Scoped)

Hierarchical cost tracking codes shared across all projects.

```bash
pcxa cost-codes list --root-only
pcxa cost-codes get 1                                 # detail with children
pcxa cost-codes create --code "03.300" --name "Cast-in-Place Concrete"
pcxa cost-codes create --code "03.310" --name "Structural" --parent 1
pcxa cost-codes update 1 --active false
pcxa cost-codes delete 1
```

## Budgets (Cost Code Budgets)

```bash
pcxa budgets list
pcxa budgets create --cost-code 1 --amount 50000 --units 200
pcxa budgets update 1 --amount 75000
pcxa budgets delete 1
```

## Timesheets

Time/cost tracking per resource with approval workflow: `draft` → `submitted` → `approved` | `rejected` → `draft`.

```bash
pcxa timesheets list --status draft --resource 5
pcxa timesheets list --after 2026-03-01 --before 2026-03-31
pcxa timesheets get 1                                 # detail with all entries
pcxa timesheets create --resource 5 --period-start 2026-03-24 --period-end 2026-03-30 --period-type weekly
pcxa timesheets update 1 --period-end 2026-03-31
pcxa timesheets delete 1
pcxa timesheets submit 1                              # draft → submitted
pcxa timesheets approve 1                             # submitted → approved
pcxa timesheets reject 1 --reason "Missing entries"   # submitted → rejected
pcxa timesheets reopen 1                              # rejected → draft
```

**Period types:** `weekly`, `biweekly`, `monthly`. Only draft/rejected timesheets are editable.

## Time Entries (nested under timesheets)

```bash
pcxa entries list 1                                   # entries for timesheet 1
pcxa entries list 1 --date 2026-03-25 --activity 123
pcxa entries create 1 --activity 123 --date 2026-03-25 --hours 8
pcxa entries create 1 --activity 123 --date 2026-03-25 --hours 2 --type overtime --cost-code 5
pcxa entries update 1 42 --hours 6 --description "Half day"
pcxa entries delete 1 42
```

**Types:** `regular`, `overtime`, `double_time` | Hours: 0.01–24

## Cost Entries (nested under timesheets)

```bash
pcxa cost-entries list 1
pcxa cost-entries create 1 --resource 8 --activity 123 --date 2026-03-25 --quantity 5 --unit-cost 200
pcxa cost-entries update 1 42 --quantity 10
pcxa cost-entries delete 1 42
```

`total_cost` auto-computed: `quantity × unit_cost`.

## Time Period Locks

Lock date ranges to prevent edits.

```bash
pcxa locks list
pcxa locks create --period-start 2026-03-01 --period-end 2026-03-15 --reason "Month closed"
pcxa locks delete 1
```

## Links (Entity Links)

Connect any two objects (files, activities, photos, drawings) with contextual descriptions. Object references use `type:id` format.

**Types:** `file`, `activity`, `photo`, `drawing`, `source_document`, `project`

```bash
pcxa links list --source file:170106                  # links from a file
pcxa links list --target activity:3710                # links to an activity
pcxa links list --source file:170106 --target activity:3710  # specific pair
pcxa links create --source file:170106 --target file:170107 --type attachment
pcxa links create --source activity:3710 --target file:170106 --type deliverable
pcxa links create --source file:170129 --target file:170100 --type "supersedes" --description "Corrected analysis"
pcxa links delete 42
pcxa links bulk --file links.json                     # bulk create from JSON
```

**Bulk JSON format** (`links.json`):
```json
[
  {"source": "file:170106", "target": "file:170107", "type": "attachment"},
  {"source": "activity:3710", "target": "file:170106", "description": "RFI analysis deliverable"},
  {"source_type": "file", "source_id": 170129, "target_type": "file", "target_id": 170100, "type": "supersedes"}
]
```

The `--type` flag sets the description field (the backend doesn't enforce typed relationships). Use `--description` for longer context. Both shorthand (`"source": "file:123"`) and explicit (`"source_type": "file", "source_id": 123`) formats work in bulk JSON.

`links bulk` calls the server-side bulk endpoint (up to 500 links per request, auto-chunked for larger files) instead of one request per link — rows are validated independently server-side, so one bad row doesn't fail the batch. Output reports `created`, `exists` (already-present links, not an error), and `failed` (per-row errors with the row index).

## AI Chat

Send messages to the project's AI assistant and read back its replies. Useful for ad-hoc probing and for letting an agent evaluate chatbot response quality. Project-scoped — uses the `.pcxa` company/project.

```bash
pcxa chat send "What is the status of the foundation work?"          # uses current conversation, waits for reply
pcxa chat send "..." --new --title "Eval run 1"                      # fresh conversation
pcxa chat send "..." --conversation 123                              # continue an existing thread
pcxa chat send "..." --research                                      # enable file-search tools (research_mode)
pcxa chat send "..." --model gemini-2.5-pro                          # override model (see chat models)
pcxa chat send "..." --no-wait                                       # fire-and-forget; returns agent_task_id
pcxa chat send "..." --timeout 300                                   # polling timeout (default 180s)

pcxa chat ls --search "RFI"                                          # list conversations
pcxa chat get [ID]                                                    # show full transcript (default: current)
pcxa chat get 123 --show-tools                                        # include tool calls
pcxa chat new --title "Probe"                                         # create empty conversation
pcxa chat delete 123                                                  # soft-delete (archive)
pcxa chat models                                                      # list available models
```

**Default JSON output** (from `chat send`):
```json
{
  "conversation_id": 42,
  "agent_task_id": 9001,
  "agent_task_status": "completed",
  "elapsed_seconds": 14.2,
  "timed_out": false,
  "user_message": {"id": 500, "content": "..."},
  "assistant_message": {
    "id": 501, "role": "assistant", "content": "...",
    "tool_steps": [...], "thinking_steps": [...], "action_cards": [...]
  }
}
```

**How it works:** `chat send` submits a message, waits for the platform's assistant task to finish, and returns the assistant response. Exit code 2 means the task failed. `--no-wait` skips polling and returns the task ID immediately.

## Reporting API errors

When a PCXa CLI command returns a non-2xx API response, surface the endpoint, status code, and response body to the user. Do not invent alternate data paths; ask the user how they want to proceed.

## Invocation

`/pcxa $ARGUMENTS` → `pcxa $ARGUMENTS` (if installed via pipx) or `python .claude/skills/pcxa/pcxa.py $ARGUMENTS`
