# Build an RLM

An RLM is a callable, pre-configured agent. It autonomously explores context,
writes and executes code in a sandboxed REPL, calls tools, inspects results, and
iterates until the task is done. Unlike a chat agent, an RLM is a function — you
define its inputs, outputs, and tools, then call it from your code. It returns
structured data, not chat messages.

This skill has two phases:

1. **Plan** — interactively define the RLM with the user, research feasibility,
   produce a plan
2. **Build** — implement the plan as code files

**First action**: Check skill freshness if due, then enter plan mode using the
EnterPlanMode tool, unless the user is contributing to predict-rlm/RLM-GEPA
itself. For contribution work, use Contributor mode first.

---

# Skill freshness check

When this skill is loaded in an environment with shell, filesystem, and network
access, run a lightweight update check at most once per day. Keep the last-check
marker under
`${HERMES_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes}/skills/.rlm-skill-update-check.json`. Compare the
installed `SKILL.md` against
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Trampoline-AI/predict-rlm/main/.agents/skills/rlm/SKILL.md`
using a content hash, ETag, or commit SHA.

If a newer skill is available, tell the user the `/rlm` skill has updates and
ask whether they want to update or reinstall it. Do not update automatically.
Suggested commands are `hermes skills update` for Hermes-managed installs, or
`npx skills add Trampoline-AI/predict-rlm` for direct Skills CLI installs.

Skip the check silently when tools, network, or a writable marker path are not
available.

---

# Contributor mode for predict-rlm / RLM-GEPA

Use this mode when the user is modifying this repository's code, docs, examples,
or installable skill guidance rather than asking you to build a new RLM package.
Do not force the new-RLM scoping interview. First inspect the repo context, the
requested change, and the relevant implementation/docs paths.

Contributor rules:

- PredictRLM is for callable, repeatable, deep-context workflows, not open-ended
  interactive chat flows.
- Keep large inputs as `File` references or metadata. Use focused `predict()`
  calls, and keep LLM-facing Pydantic schemas lean with
  `Field(description=...)`.
- Validate at system boundaries. Prefer host-side tools for native libraries,
  auth, network APIs, filesystem-heavy work, and anything that cannot run
  cleanly in Pyodide.
- For RLM-GEPA, treat `AgentSpec`, evaluator feedback, and seed instructions as
  the optimization direction. Keep runtime and budget knobs separate.
- Derive `AgentSpec` signature/tool context from the constructed RLM with
  `agent_spec_from_rlm(...)` where possible. Avoid duplicating broad prose or
  exposing internal IDs unnecessarily.
- Keep generic proposer behavior domain-neutral. Domain or benchmark specifics
  belong in `AgentSpec`, seed/domain skills, runtime grounding examples, or
  evaluator feedback.
- Patch-merge/crossover should be evidence-backed behavioral grafting from train
  disagreement traces, not broad synthesis, prompt concatenation, or source text
  import.
- Persist experimental optimizer behavior in config, CLI options, or artifacts
  rather than hidden env-only switches.
- Creating GitHub PRs/issues or pushing public branches is external publishing;
  do it only when explicitly requested.
- When an investigation identifies a bug or problem likely attributable to the
  `predict-rlm` package, ask the user whether they want it reported as a GitHub
  issue as soon as that attribution is clear. Do not open the issue without that
  explicit approval.
- For verification, docs-only changes need markdown sanity or
  `git diff
  --check`. Code changes need targeted tests, plus broader tests
  when touching shared interfaces, sandbox execution, optimizer behavior, or
  examples.

# Phase 1: Plan

Work through these steps interactively. Do not skip steps or rush to the plan.
Each step should involve asking the user questions and confirming alignment
before moving on.

## Step 1: Goal Definition

Understand what the user wants to build.

Ask:

- What is the desired outcome? What does success look like?
- What is the input material? (documents, code, data, APIs, etc.)
- What does the output look like? (structured report, modified files,
  spreadsheet, etc.)

Then **validate RLM fit**. An RLM is the right tool when:

- The input is large and needs selective exploration (documents, datasets,
  codebases)
- The task is multi-step with tool use (extract -> transform -> validate)
- Actions modify state (redaction, form filling, generation)
- Parallel sub-LM calls are needed across many items
- File-to-file transformations (PDFs -> spreadsheets, documents -> reports)

If the task is better served by a single LLM call or a simple script, tell the
user and suggest an alternative. Otherwise, proceed.

## Step 2: Input Design

Work with the user to define every input to the RLM.

For each input, determine:

- **Name** and **type**: `File`, `list[File]`, `str`, or a Pydantic model
- **Description**: what it contains and how the RLM uses it
- **Source**: user-provided file, API response, config, generated data

Key principles:

- Large content (PDFs, images, datasets) must be `File` references — the RLM
  accesses content on-demand through skills, keeping its context small
- Metadata (file paths, page counts, config flags) can be strings or Pydantic
  models
- Use `list[File]` for variable-count file inputs

Confirm the input design with the user before proceeding.

## Step 3: Output Design

Work with the user to define the structured output.

For each output field, determine:

- **Name**, **type**, and **description**
- Whether it's a Pydantic model (structured data), `File` (generated file), or
  primitive

Push for specificity — vague outputs lead to poor RLM performance. Sketch the
Pydantic models with `Field(description=...)` annotations. Include nested models
where appropriate.

Ask the user:

- What fields matter most? What would they check first?
- Are there any computed/derived fields (scores, summaries, counts)?
- Do they need output files (Excel, PDF, images)?

Confirm the output design with the user before proceeding.

## Step 4: Research

This step is **autonomous**. Tell the user you are researching, then do it.

Use web search and the Explore subagent to:

1. **Find Python packages** for the domain (e.g., `networkx` for graphs,
   `tree-sitter` for code parsing, `beautifulsoup4` for HTML).

2. **Check Pyodide compatibility**. The sandbox runs Pyodide (Python in WASM).
   Only **pure-Python wheels** or packages with **Emscripten builds** work.
   Search pypi.org for each package and check:
   - Does it have a `py3-none-any` wheel? (pure Python — works)
   - Does it have C extensions without Emscripten builds? (won't work in
     sandbox)
   - Is it in the Pyodide built-in package list? (check
     <https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html>)

3. **Identify network needs**. Does the task require calling external APIs? If
   so, note the domains for `allowed_domains`.

4. **Identify host-side tool needs**. If any functionality cannot run in WASM
   (native binaries, C extensions, heavy computation), it must be a **host-side
   tool** — a Python function running on the host that the RLM calls like any
   other tool.

5. **Check for existing skills**. The built-in skills are:
   - `pdf` — pymupdf for PDF rendering, text extraction, manipulation
   - `spreadsheet` — openpyxl, pandas, formulas for Excel work
   - `docx` — python-docx for reading, writing, and modifying Word documents

Report findings to the user with a clear feasibility assessment. Flag any
blockers.

## Step 5: Skill Design

Based on research, design the skill configuration.

### Built-in skills

List which built-in skills to use and why.

### Custom skills (if needed)

For each custom skill, define:

- **name**: short identifier
- **instructions**: prose guidance injected into the RLM's system prompt —
  teaches the RLM patterns and best practices. Be detailed; this is the primary
  way to control RLM behavior.
- **packages**: PyPI packages installed in the sandbox via micropip (must be
  Pyodide-compatible)
- **modules**: Python files mounted into the sandbox as importable modules
- **tools**: host-side callable functions exposed to the RLM

### Host-side tool design

For each host-side tool:

- Function name and signature with type hints
- Docstring (the RLM sees this to understand how to call it)
- What it does and why it must be host-side

Confirm the skill design with the user before proceeding.

## Step 6: Strategy and Architecture

### Signature strategy

Write the step-by-step strategy that goes in the signature's docstring. This is
the RLM's playbook:

1. What to do first (survey/understand the input)
2. How to gather information (render pages, use predict() for extraction, call
   tools)
3. How to process and synthesize
4. What to produce and where to save output files

### Single vs chained RLMs

Evaluate whether this needs one RLM or multiple chained RLMs.

**Use a single RLM when**:

- The task is one coherent workflow
- All steps need the same context/state
- The iteration count stays reasonable (under 40)

**Use chained RLMs when**:

- There are distinct phases with different skill needs
- One phase produces artifacts consumed by another
- The combined task would exceed reasonable iteration counts
- Different phases benefit from different sub-LM models

If chaining, define each stage:

- Stage name, signature (inputs/outputs), skills, strategy
- The DAG: which stage feeds into which, with typed connections

### Configuration

- `max_iterations` estimate per RLM
- `allowed_domains` if network access is needed
- `sub_lm` recommendations (capability level needed)

### Delivery scope

Confirm which artifacts the user wants. Do not assume evals or optimization are
required for every RLM.

- **Agent only**: the callable RLM package, domain skills/tools, and fast smoke
  tests. This is the default unless the user asks for benchmarking or GEPA.
- **Agent + evals**: add a `bench/` package with dataset loading, scoring, and
  evaluation CLI/helpers. Use this when the user has labeled examples, fixtures,
  or a deterministic metric.
- **Agent + optimization**: add project-local RLM-GEPA wiring only when the user
  wants prompt/skill optimization. GEPA needs train/validation examples and a
  metric, but it does not require a separate held-out eval CLI unless requested.
- **Full project**: agent, tools, benchmark/eval harness, and optimization
  wiring, like the SpreadBench example.

### RLM-GEPA scoping interview

When the user asks for optimization wiring but has not supplied enough context
to write a concrete `AgentSpec`, run a short interview before writing the plan.
Do not invent the AgentSpec from a vague task description. Gather enough to
define:

- the product or optimization goal GEPA should improve for;
- the input distribution, scale, and examples that represent real work;
- the output schema and the failure modes users care about most;
- the train/validation data source and whether labels or reference outputs
  exist;
- the scoring rule, partial-credit feedback, and anti-overfitting boundaries;
- the tools, sandbox constraints, file conventions, and runtime facts the
  proposer must preserve.

The interview should scope the RLM that owns the real DSPy signature and tools;
do not ask the user to restate `target_signature`, `tool_signatures`, or a broad
agent description as separate prose artifacts. Generate the signature/tool
fields from the constructed RLM with `agent_spec_from_rlm(...)`; omit
`agent_type` unless the user volunteers a product or optimization anchor that
adds useful context.

If the user cannot answer everything, proceed with explicit assumptions and mark
the generated `AgentSpec` fields that should be revisited before spending model
calls.

### Dataset and split hygiene

When the user asks for evals or optimization, investigate the dataset before
writing split or scoring code. Inspect enough examples to identify task types,
input sizes, label/reference-output shape, duplicate or near-duplicate examples,
leakage risks, missing labels, and failure buckets the scorer should expose.
Capture those findings in the plan instead of treating the dataset as an opaque
list of rows.

Use split semantics consistently:

- **Train**: examples the optimizer/proposer may use to generate and gate edits.
- **Validation**: examples used for candidate selection and regression checks
  during optimization.
- **Test / held-out eval**: optional final reporting set. Do not create or spend
  on it unless the user asks for a benchmark/eval harness or has enough labeled
  data to justify it.

Prefer deterministic splits. Put the random seed, split ratio/counts, grouping
key (if examples share source documents/users/tasks), and any sampling limits in
`bench/config.py` or `gepa/config.py`. Split by group when leakage is plausible;
never let near-identical cases from the same source land in both train and
validation without calling it out. If the dataset is tiny, prefer explicit
hand-authored train/validation files over random splitting.

For GEPA, the project-local `gepa/` code owns train/validation loading and the
seed candidate text. The seed candidate means the initial mutable component,
such as baseline skill instructions; it is separate from the random seed used
for splits, sampling, or optimizer reproducibility.

For benchmarks with official splits, preserve the benchmark's public semantics.
Use the official train split for optimization data, carve GEPA validation from
that train split when a candidate-selection set is needed, and reserve official
dev/test/challenge splits for reporting only when the user asks for held-out
benchmark evaluation. Do not let optimizer feedback leak from held-out splits
into seed instructions or candidate selection.

### Benchmark integration boundaries

Keep benchmark evaluators and oracle-style answer checkers harness-side. The RLM
may see environment-safe tools, docs, state APIs, or session controls, but it
should not see evaluator feedback or hidden scoring APIs while solving an
example. After the attempt, the harness can call the evaluator and pass score
and feedback to GEPA as the learning signal.

When benchmark packages conflict with predict-rlm, DSPy, Pyodide, or the main
project environment, prefer an isolated host-side runner/tool behind a typed
JSON boundary. Do not force incompatible benchmark dependencies into the RLM
sandbox or main package environment.

For eval and optimization CLIs, route task execution through the shared
`rlm_gepa.runtime.adapter.RLMGepaAdapter` semantics rather than bespoke
`asyncio.gather` loops. Project-local `bench/` code may own dataset selection,
candidate loading, and `eval.json` summary shaping, but should reuse the adapter
for concurrency, per-task timeouts, progress bars, verbose RLM log handling,
`task_traces/*.jsonl`, and `cost_log.jsonl`. If the eval command is async, call
`await adapter.aevaluate(...)`; if it is synchronous, call
`adapter.evaluate(...)`. Write `eval.json` in the run directory so
`rlm-gepa stats <run_dir>` works for held-out evals as well as optimize runs.

## Feasibility Checklist

Before producing the final plan, verify:

- [ ] All proposed packages are Pyodide-compatible (or have host-side fallbacks)
- [ ] Network access needs are identified with specific domains
- [ ] Host-side tools are defined for anything that can't run in WASM
- [ ] Iteration count is reasonable (under 50 per RLM)
- [ ] Input sizes are manageable (or chunking strategy is defined)
- [ ] Output schemas are specific enough for reliable extraction
- [ ] The task is achievable — no unsupported capabilities assumed

## Plan Output

Write the plan to the Claude Code plan file with these sections:

1. **Overview** — one paragraph: what, why, and expected workflow
2. **Delivery scope** — agent-only, evals, optimization, or full project
3. **File manifest** — every file to create with a one-line description
4. **Input schemas** — complete Pydantic model code for `agent/schema.py`
5. **Output schemas** — complete Pydantic model code for `agent/schema.py`
6. **Signature** — complete `agent/signature.py` code with strategy docstring
7. **Skills configuration** — built-in imports + custom `Skill(...)`
   definitions + tool signatures
8. **Service architecture** — single RLM wiring or chained DAG:

   ```
   Stage1(documents) --[ExtractedData]--> Stage2(extracted) --[Report]--> Stage3(report)
   ```

9. **Optional eval/optimization design** — only if requested. Include dataset
   audit findings, split policy, scoring feedback shape, and reproducibility
   seed. For optimization, also include the `AgentSpec` interview summary,
   train/validation source, seed candidate source, and the exact `gepa/` files
   to create.
10. **Feasibility notes** — constraints, risks, alternatives
11. **Estimated complexity** — iteration count, sub-LM calls, cost range,
    runtime
12. **Smoke tests** — test files to create and commands to run. Every generated
    RLM must include at least one fast no-network smoke test that imports the
    generated package and constructs the service without making LLM calls.

After writing the plan, use ExitPlanMode to get user approval. Once approved,
proceed to Phase 2.

---

# Phase 2: Build

Implement the approved plan. Create all files following the patterns below.

## File structure

Default to a grouped package. Keep the root package thin and put the callable
RLM under `agent/`. Add `tools/`, `bench/`, and `gepa/` only when the selected
delivery scope needs them.

```

```

**Always create**: `pyproject.toml`, package `__init__.py`, `agent/schema.py`,
`agent/signature.py`, `agent/service.py`, `agent/__init__.py`, and
`tests/test_smoke.py`.

**Create when needed**:

- `agent/skills.py` when the RLM needs domain-specific instructions beyond
  built-in skills.
- `tools/` when host-side functions or helper modules are needed.
- `bench/` when the user wants evals, datasets, scoring, or eval config.
- `gepa/` and a console script when the user wants RLM-GEPA optimization.

Do not add compatibility shims for old flat module names in newly generated
projects. The grouped imports are the source of truth.

## pyproject.toml — Dependencies and generated-with metadata

Every generated RLM project should record which predict-rlm version and skill
layout it targets. Use the current package version unless the user explicitly
pins another one. For this repository version, that is `0.4.1`.

Agent-only project:

```toml
[project]
name = "my-rlm"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
dependencies = [
    "predict-rlm>=0.4.1,<0.5",
]

[tool.predict-rlm.generated]
predict_rlm_version = "0.4.1"
skill_version = "2.0"
layout = "agent-tools-bench-gepa"
features = ["agent"]
```

If the project uses built-in example skills, add only the required extras or
packages. If it uses GEPA, add the GEPA extras and project-local `rlm-gepa`
script as the main UX. Do not include optimization dependencies for an
agent-only or eval-only project.

```toml
dependencies = [
    "predict-rlm[examples,gepa,gepa-viz]>=0.4.1,<0.5",
]

[project.scripts]
rlm-gepa = "my_rlm.gepa:main"

[tool.predict-rlm.generated]
predict_rlm_version = "0.4.1"
skill_version = "2.0"
layout = "agent-tools-bench-gepa"
features = ["agent", "tools", "bench", "rlm-gepa"]
```

For examples inside the predict-rlm monorepo, an editable path source is fine,
but keep the generated metadata table so readers know which API/layout version
the project was generated against.

## agent/schema.py — Pydantic models

Define models for structured inputs and outputs. Use `Field(description=...)` so
the RLM knows what each field means.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


class KeyDate(BaseModel):
    """A key date extracted from a document."""

    name: str = Field(description="e.g. 'Submission Deadline', 'Effective Date'")
    date: str = Field(description="ISO format date (YYYY-MM-DD)")
    time: str | None = Field(
        None, description="24-hour format (HH:MM), e.g. '14:00', '09:30'"
    )
    timezone: str | None = Field(
        None, description="Timezone code, e.g. 'EST', 'EDT', 'PST', 'UTC'"
    )


class DocumentAnalysis(BaseModel):
    """Structured analysis of a document set."""

    report: str = Field(
        description="Full analysis as a well-formatted markdown report"
    )
    key_dates: list[KeyDate] = Field(
        default_factory=list, description="Important dates found in the documents"
    )
```

## agent/signature.py — Inputs, outputs, and strategy

The docstring becomes the RLM's system instructions — tell the RLM how to
approach the task step by step:

```python
import dspy

from predict_rlm import File

from .schema import DocumentAnalysis


class AnalyzeDocuments(dspy.Signature):
    """Analyze documents and produce a structured report.

    1. **Read the report criteria** (appended below) to understand what
       information to extract and in what format.

    2. **Survey the documents** to understand what you're working with:
       file names, page counts, document types.

    3. **Gather information** systematically by rendering pages as images
       and using predict() to extract content.

    4. **Produce the report** following the format specified in the criteria.
       Use tables for structured data, prose for analysis and context.
    """

    documents: list[File] = dspy.InputField(
        desc="PDF documents to analyze"
    )
    analysis: DocumentAnalysis = dspy.OutputField(
        desc="Structured analysis with markdown report, key dates, and key entities"
    )
```

## agent/service.py — Wiring it together

Wrap signature + skills + PredictRLM into a reusable DSPy Module:

```python
import dspy

from predict_rlm import File, PredictRLM
from predict_rlm.skills import pdf as pdf_skill

from .schema import DocumentAnalysis
from .signature import AnalyzeDocuments


class DocumentAnalyzer(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(
        self,
        sub_lm: dspy.LM | str | None = None,
        max_iterations: int = 30,
        verbose: bool = False,
        debug: bool = False,
    ):
        self.sub_lm = sub_lm
        self.max_iterations = max_iterations
        self.verbose = verbose
        self.debug = debug

    async def aforward(
        self, documents: list[File], criteria: str
    ) -> DocumentAnalysis:
        signature = AnalyzeDocuments.with_instructions(
            AnalyzeDocuments.instructions + "\n\n# Task\n\n" + criteria.strip()
        )
        predictor = PredictRLM(
            signature,
            sub_lm=self.sub_lm,
            skills=[pdf_skill],
            max_iterations=self.max_iterations,
            verbose=self.verbose,
            debug=self.debug,
        )
        result = await predictor.acall(documents=documents)
        return result.analysis
```

When using multiple skills or host-side tools:

```python
from predict_rlm.skills import pdf as pdf_skill
from predict_rlm.skills import spreadsheet as spreadsheet_skill

async def aforward(self, documents: list[File]) -> MyOutput:
    predictor = PredictRLM(
        MySignature,
        sub_lm=self.sub_lm,
        skills=[pdf_skill, spreadsheet_skill],
        tools={"fetch_exchange_rate": fetch_exchange_rate},
        ...
    )
```

### Chaining pattern (multiple RLMs)

```python
async def aforward(self, documents: list[File]):
    # Stage 1: Extract
    extractor = PredictRLM(ExtractSignature, sub_lm=self.sub_lm, skills=[pdf_skill])
    extracted = await extractor.acall(documents=documents)

    # Stage 2: Analyze (uses output from stage 1)
    analyzer = PredictRLM(AnalyzeSignature, sub_lm=self.sub_lm, skills=[analysis_skill])
    result = await analyzer.acall(data=extracted.data)

    return result
```

## agent/skills.py — Custom skills

Create only when the RLM needs domain-specific instructions beyond built-in
skills.

```python
from predict_rlm import Skill
from predict_rlm.skills import pdf as pdf_skill

redaction_skill = Skill(
    name="redaction",
    instructions="""How to redact content from PDFs using pymupdf.

## Text redaction
Search for text, create redaction annotations, then apply:
    page = doc[page_num]
    hits = page.search_for("sensitive text")
    for rect in hits:
        page.add_redact_annot(rect, fill=(0, 0, 0))
    page.apply_redactions()
...""",
)

__all__ = ["pdf_skill", "redaction_skill"]
```

## tests/test_smoke.py — Generated smoke tests

Create smoke tests for every generated RLM. The default smoke test must be fast
and must not require network access, API keys, Deno, Pyodide, or an actual LLM
call. It should prove the generated package imports, the signature exposes the
expected fields, and the service can be constructed.

Tailor imports and class names to the generated RLM:

```python
def test_service_constructs():
    from my_rlm import DocumentAnalyzer

    service = DocumentAnalyzer(max_iterations=1, verbose=False, debug=False)
    assert service.max_iterations == 1


def test_signature_has_fields():
    from my_rlm.agent.signature import AnalyzeDocuments

    assert AnalyzeDocuments.input_fields
    assert AnalyzeDocuments.output_fields
```

If the generated project includes tiny local fixtures and the user wants an
end-to-end check, add a separate `@pytest.mark.integration` test that performs a
minimal `acall`. Gate that test behind explicit credentials or an environment
flag so the default smoke suite remains deterministic and cheap.

## Optional bench/ package — Evals

Create `bench/` only when the user wants evaluation. Keep it project-local:
dataset loaders, scoring rules, fixtures, and reports belong here, not in
`agent/`. Evals can exist without optimization. The eval layer should make the
dataset audit and split policy explicit: where examples come from, how labels or
reference outputs are represented, which examples are train/validation/test, and
which seed/grouping rules make the split reproducible.

Suggested files when needed:

```text
bench/

For benchmark eval and optimize entrypoints, use the shared RLM-GEPA runtime
adapter semantics in `src/rlm_gepa/runtime/adapter.py` unless the user
explicitly asks for a one-off local harness. Put dataset loading, scoring,
setup, and task cleanup behind the project contract; let the shared adapter own
concurrency, timeouts, progress/tqdm display, trace capture, and report
semantics.

## Optional gepa/ package — Optimization

Create optimization wiring only when the user asks for it. The shared `rlm_gepa`
package provides generic orchestration; the generated project owns its task
loading, metric, seed candidate, and defaults. Import `agent_spec_from_rlm`,
`OptimizeConfig`, `RLMGepaExampleResult`, `RLMGepaProject`, and
`EvaluationContext` from `rlm_gepa` rather than copying optimizer internals into
the project.

The generated `AgentSpec` should be interview-backed, but it should not
duplicate facts already present on the RLM. Define a single `build_rlm(...)`
helper that constructs the PredictRLM with the real DSPy signature, skills, and
tools. Use `agent_spec_from_rlm(build_rlm(seed_instructions), ...)` so GEPA
derives `target_signature` and `tool_signatures` from that object. Omit
`agent_type` by default; set it only for a short product or optimization anchor
that adds non-duplicative framing beyond the signature, tools, or output schema.
The interview should supply only the extra GEPA brief: transfer use cases,
runtime-grounding examples, scoring signal, and anti-overfitting boundary. If
any of those are weakly specified, add a `TODO` in `config.py` and keep
`optimize --check` available so the user can catch missing setup before spending
model calls.

Suggested files when needed:

```text
gepa/
├── __init__.py    # Exports `main` for the console script
├── config.py      # Project-local OptimizeConfig defaults + AgentSpec
├── project.py     # RLMGepaProject implementation and metric wiring
├── cli.py         # Thin run_project_cli glue
└── __main__.py    # Optional `python -m my_rlm.gepa`
```

Optimization can reuse helpers from `bench/` when evals exist. If a `bench/`
package is present, expose its seed/validation/held-out evaluation flow as an
`eval` subcommand on the same GEPA CLI surface. Do not create a held-out eval
command just because GEPA is present: GEPA needs training and validation
examples plus feedback; a separate benchmark/eval suite is optional.

# Architecture Reference

Use this reference to ensure plans and implementations are accurate. Do not
hallucinate parameters or patterns.

## How an RLM works

The architecture is two-level:

1. **The outer LLM** (the RLM itself) writes and executes Python code in a
   sandboxed Pyodide/WASM REPL. It plans, orchestrates, and iterates.
2. **The sub-LM** (via `predict()`) handles perception and extraction —
   analyzing images, understanding text, and returning typed results. Each
   `predict()` call gets its own context window.

The outer LLM's context stays small (code + tool results), while context-heavy
work is offloaded to `predict()` calls.

## File I/O

Use `File` for file-typed fields:

- **Input field**: mounts the file from host into the sandbox at
  `/sandbox/input/{field_name}/`
- **Output field**: syncs from `/sandbox/output/{field_name}/` back to the host

```python
from predict_rlm import File

# Input: File(path="/absolute/path/to/file.pdf")
# Output: declared as File output field, RLM writes to /sandbox/output/<field>/
```

## PredictRLM constructor

```python
PredictRLM(
    signature: type[Signature] | str,     # DSPy signature class
    lm: dspy.LM | str | None = None,      # Main LM (code generation)
    sub_lm: dspy.LM | str | None = None,  # Sub-LM for predict() calls
    max_iterations: int = 30,
    max_llm_calls: int = 50,
    verbose: bool = False,
    tools: dict[str, Callable] | list[Callable] | None = None,
    allowed_domains: list[str] | None = None,
    skills: list[Skill] | None = None,
    debug: bool = False,
    output_dir: str | Path | None = None,
)
```

Both `lm` and `sub_lm` accept a model string (e.g. `"openai/gpt-5.4"`) or a
`dspy.LM` instance. If `lm` is omitted, the current context LM from
`dspy.context(lm=...)` is used.

## CodexLM / ChatGPT subscription backend

Starting in `predict-rlm` v0.7.0, `predict-rlm[codex-lm]` includes
`dspy_codex_lm.CodexLM`, a DSPy LM backed by the Codex/ChatGPT subscription
backend. Use it when the user wants PredictRLM to run on Codex model slugs
through ChatGPT/Codex auth instead of normal OpenAI API keys.

Install and authenticate:

```bash
uv add "predict-rlm[codex-lm]"
uv run codex-lm auth login default
uv run codex-lm auth status
uv run codex-lm smoke-test --model gpt-5.5
```

For prerelease builds, allow prereleases explicitly:

```bash
uv add --prerelease=allow "predict-rlm[codex-lm]==0.7.0-alpha0"
```

Use `CodexLM` directly when wiring `lm` or `sub_lm`:

```python
from dspy_codex_lm import CodexLM
from predict_rlm import PredictRLM

rlm = PredictRLM(
    MySignature,
    lm=CodexLM(model="gpt-5.5"),
    sub_lm=CodexLM(model="gpt-5.5"),
)
```

To run an existing DSPy script without editing its LM construction, use the CLI
wrapper. It monkeypatches OpenAI-family `dspy.LM(...)` calls and routes supported
Codex model slugs to `CodexLM`:

```bash
uv run codex-lm my_dspy_script.py
```

Useful CLI commands:

```bash
uv run codex-lm --help
uv run codex-lm auth list
uv run codex-lm usage
uv run codex-lm rotation on
```

Important caveats:

- CodexLM uses Codex/ChatGPT subscription auth, not ordinary OpenAI API keys.
- Routing is strict: OpenAI-family model strings are intercepted only when the
  slug is a supported Codex model; unsupported OpenAI-family slugs raise an
  error instead of silently falling back.
- Common supported slugs include `gpt-5.1-codex`, `gpt-5.1-codex-max`,
  `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`, `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.2-codex`, `gpt-5.3-codex`,
  `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, and `gpt-5.5`.

## Skill dataclass

```python
from predict_rlm import Skill

Skill(
    name="my-skill",                          # Short identifier
    instructions="How to approach...",         # Prose injected into the RLM prompt
    packages=["pandas", "openpyxl"],           # PyPI packages installed in the sandbox
    modules={"helper": "/path/to/helper.py"},  # Python files mounted as importable modules
    tools={"fetch": fetch_fn},                 # Host-side callable functions exposed to the RLM
)
```

Skills can bundle **host-side tools** via their `tools=` field. When skills are
composed, their tools are merged alongside instructions and packages (tool name
conflicts raise errors).

## Built-in skills

```python
from predict_rlm.skills import pdf as pdf_skill          # pymupdf
from predict_rlm.skills import spreadsheet as spreadsheet_skill  # openpyxl, pandas, formulas
from predict_rlm.skills import docx as docx_skill        # python-docx
```

| Skill           | Packages                         | Modules        | What it teaches the RLM                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **pdf**         | `pymupdf`                        | —              | Read, render, modify, and redact PDFs                                      |
| **spreadsheet** | `openpyxl`, `pandas`, `formulas` | `formula_eval` | Build and modify Excel workbooks with formulas and formatting              |
| **docx**        | `python-docx`                    | `md2docx`      | Read, write, and modify Word documents with tables, formatting, and styles |

## Tools

Tools are **host-side functions** the RLM can call from the sandbox. Use them
for operations that cannot run inside the sandbox — host access, authenticated
APIs, database queries, system resources.

```python
async def fetch_exchange_rate(currency: str, date: str) -> str:
    """Fetch the exchange rate for a currency on a given date.

    Args:
        currency: ISO currency code (e.g. "EUR", "GBP")
        date: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format

    Returns:
        JSON string with the exchange rate data
    """
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        resp = await client.get(f"https://api.example.com/rates/{currency}/{date}")
        return resp.text
```

Tools can be passed directly to PredictRLM via `tools={"name": fn}` or bundled
inside a Skill via `tools=`.

### When to use a Skill vs tools

| Use a Skill when...                                  | Use `tools=` when...                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The RLM needs a **package** installed in the sandbox | The function must run on the **host** (API calls, DB queries, filesystem) |
| You need to teach the RLM **how to use** something   | The tool's docstring is self-explanatory                                  |
| The knowledge is **reusable** across RLMs            | It's a single specific function for one RLM                               |

## predict() tool (inside sandbox)

The RLM can call `predict()` for sub-LM perception/extraction:

```python
result = await predict(
    "image: dspy.Image -> items: list[Item]",
    instructions="Extract all line items from this invoice page",
    image=page_image,
)
```

Each predict() call gets its own context window. Supports `dspy.Image` for
multimodal.

## Key imports

```python
from predict_rlm import PredictRLM, Skill, File
from predict_rlm.skills import pdf, spreadsheet, docx
```

## WASM sandbox constraints

- Only pure-Python wheels or Pyodide built-in packages work
- No subprocess, no native binaries, no C extensions (unless Emscripten-built)
- Network access requires `allowed_domains` whitelist
- File I/O is within the sandbox filesystem
- Host-side tools bridge the gap for anything WASM can't do
