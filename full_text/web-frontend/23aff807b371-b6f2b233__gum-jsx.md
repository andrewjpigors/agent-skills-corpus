# Introduction

The `gum.jsx` language allows for the elegant and concise creation of SVG visualizations. It has a React-like JSX syntax. When interpreted, it produces pure SVG of a specified size. It is a library of `Element` derived components such as `Circle`, `Stack`, `Plot`, `Network`, and many more. Some of these map closely to standard SVG objects, while others are higher level abstractions and layout containers. You can add standard SVG attributes (like `fill`, `stroke`, `stroke-width`, `opacity`, etc.) to any `Element` component and they will be applied to the resulting SVG.

*Proportional values*: In most cases, values are passed in proportional floating point terms. So to place an object in the center of its parent, you would specify `pos = [0.5, 0.5]`, with the size specified by `size`. When dealing with inherently absolute concepts like `stroke-width`, standard SVG units are used, and numerical values assumed to be specified in pixels. Most `Element` objects fill the standard coordinate space `[0, 0, 1, 1]` by default. To reposition them, either pass the appropriate internal arguments (such as `pos` or `size`) or use a layout component such as `Box` or `Stack` to arrange them.

*Aspect ratio*: Any `Element` object can have an aspect ratio `aspect`. If `aspect` is not defined, it will stretch to fit any box, while if `aspect` is defined it will be sized so as to fit within the specified rectangle while maintaining its aspect ratio. However, when `expand` is set to `true`, the element will be sized to cover the specified rectangle, while maintaining its aspect ratio.

*Subunit arguments*: For compound elements that inherit `Group`, some keyword arguments are passed down to the constituent parts. For instance, in [Plot](/docs/Plot), one can specify arguments intended for the `XAxis` unit by prefixing them with `xaxis-`. For example, setting the `stroke-width` for this subunit can be achieved with `xaxis-stroke-width`.

*Functional approach*: Avoid explicit for loops. There are `numpy`-like functions such as `range` and `linspace` for generating arrays, `zip` for combining arrays, and `palette` for interpolating colors. Additionally, you can use `map` to generate a list of elements (such as bars for a bar plot).

*Style tips*: There will be cases where a user prompt does not fully specify every detail. In these cases, use your best judgment and consider the following suggestions:
  - Text should be legible and not overlap. Usually a text element `ysize` of about `0.1` to `0.2` works well
  - Points and other small features should be visible but not overwhelming. Usually a size of about `0.03` is good for small features
  - The figure should have appropriate outer margins so that extended features like tick labels do not get cut off. Usually a margin of about `0.1` to `0.2` works well. The best way to create outer margins is to wrap the final output in a `Box` or `Frame` component
  - When the aspect ratio of the figure is not determined, a good default is to use `2` for things like plots and diagrams
  - The top-level `<svg>` element will have `fill="none"` and `stroke="black"` applied automatically, so you only need to specify these attributes when they differ from these defaults

# Examples

Below are some examples of user prompts and code output. In these examples, we try to highlight the most common use cases for the library, as well as some of the common pitfalls that one might encounter.

**Example 1: Basic Frame**

Let's start with a very simple example that creates a blue circle (`aspect = 1`) and encloses it in a rounded frame. In general, `Box` is an extremely useful component, as its child class `Frame`, which simply adds a default `border = 1`. This closely mirrors the behavior of a typical HTML element with Tailwind-like syntax.

*Prompt*: Create a blue circle that is enclosed in a rounded box. It should mostly fill the box, but not completely.

*Generated code*:
```jsx
<Frame padding margin rounded>
  <Circle fill={blue} />
</Frame>
```

Here we used boolean defaults for `padding`, `margin`, and `rounded`. These will get mapped to `padding={0.1}`, `margin={0.1}`, and `rounded={0.1}` respectively. This adds a little bit of a Tailwind-like flavor and is used throughout the library. Adding a `margin` on the outside is usually good so things like borders don't get clipped.

**Example 2: Symbolic Plot**

Now let's do a more complex example that uses a higher level component that is not a standard SVG element. In this case, we use `Plot`, which is a `Graph` subclass that adds axes (with `Axis`/`HAxis`/`VAxis`), labels, and other plot-specific features.

*Prompt*: Create a simple plot of a sine wave titled "Sine Wave" with dashed grid lines.

*Generated code*:
```jsx
<Plot aspect={2} margin={0.2} ylim={[-1.5, 1.5]} title="Sine Wave" grid grid-stroke-dasharray={4}>
  <SymLine fy={sin} xlim={[0, 2*pi]} />
</Plot>
```

Notice how we can pass arguments to sub-components using prefixing. Here we set the `stroke-dasharray` for the grid lines to `4`. For convenience, `Plot` accepts `Box` arguments such as `margin`, `border`, etc.

**Example 3: Custom Component**

Creating custom components is a powerful way to avoid code duplication and to make your code more readable and maintainable. Here we create a `Squire` component that is a `Square` with a default `rounded` border. Then we use this component to create two squares side by side.

*Prompt*: Create two rounded boxes side by side. Left one should be blue, right one should be red.

*Generated code*:
```jsx
const Squire = (attr) => <Square rounded {...attr} />
return <HStack spacing>
  <Squire fill={blue} />
  <Squire fill={red} />
</HStack>
```

Note: Because this is two squares (`aspect = 1`) stacked side by side, the `HStack` will have an aspect ratio of `2`. You can also use the `VStack` component to stack elements vertically. If you wish to override aspect-based sizing, you can use the `stack-size` argument to specify the size of the child elements.

**Example 4: Modular Approach**

Now let's cover a VERY IMPORTANT method of using custom components. We want to create modular and parameterizable components that can be reused in a variety of ways. Here we create a `Star` component that specifies its `Spline` path in internal coordinates, and we then pass the `pos`/`size` arguments to the component to position and scale the star.

*Prompt*: Create a semi-random starfield with about 10 yellow stars.

*Generated code*:
```jsx
const aster = [
  [0.5, 0], [0.65, 0.35],
  [1, 0.5], [0.65, 0.65],
  [0.5, 1], [0.35, 0.65],
  [0, 0.5], [0.35, 0.35],
]
const points = [
  [0.15, 0.20], [0.72, 0.12], [0.45, 0.55],
  [0.88, 0.68], [0.30, 0.80], [0.60, 0.35],
  [0.10, 0.58], [0.82, 0.42], [0.50, 0.90],
  [0.25, 0.10],
]
const Star = (attr) =>
  <Spline size={0.06} aspect closed points={aster} {...attr} />
return <Box border rounded fill={gray}>
  {points.map(p => <Star pos={p} fill={yellow} />)}
</Box>
```

Note: By creating a reusable `Star` component that accepts `pos`/`size` arguments, we can easily create a starfield by mapping over `points`. This offloads the logic of adding and scaling the spline coordinates in `aster` to the positions listed in `points`.

**Example 5: Stacking Layouts**

Stacking components can be tricky. If all your children have well-defined aspect ratios, it's often quite straightforward. But even in that case, you may want to override the default aspect-based sizing. Let's look at the case of a wide figure with a short text label underneath it.

```jsx
<VStack spacing={0.05}>
  <Rect rounded aspect={5} fill={blue} />
  <Text stack-size={0.2}>Hello World!</Text>
</VStack>
```

Without specifying `stack-size`, the `Text` element would be quite large (it has an aspect ratio of around `6`). By specifying `stack-size`, we can force the text to be smaller. Because it will be thinner than its assigned rectangle, we need to take a stance on how to justify it. By default it will be centered, but this can be overridden with the `justify` argument.

# Utilities

Here are the handy array functions provided by the library. All of these mimic the behavior of their counterparts in Python and `numpy`. This can be useful for generating `Element` objects from arrays:
```typescript
function zip(...arrs: any[]): any[]
function range(ia: number, ib?: number, step?: number = 1): number[]
function linspace(x0: number, x1: number, num: number, end?: boolean = false): number[]
function enumerate(x: any[]): any[]
function repeat(x: any, n: number): any[]
```

Some of the most commonly used mathematical constants are pre-defined in the global scope:
```javascript
const e = Math.E // base of the natural logarithm
const pi = Math.PI // ratio of circumference to diameter
const phi = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 // golden ratio
const r2d = 180 / Math.PI // conversion from radians to degrees
const d2r = Math.PI / 180 // conversion from degrees to radians
```

Additionally, there is a default `gum.jsx` color palette that is pre-defined in the global scope, but you can also use any valid CSS color string:
```javascript
const none = 'none'
const white = '#ffffff'
const black = '#000000'
const blue = '#1e88e5'
const red = '#ff0d57'
const green = '#4caf50'
const yellow = '#ffb300'
const purple = '#9c27b0'
const gray = '#f0f0f0'
```

To interpolate colors between color values, you can use these functions:
```typescript
function interp(c1: string, c2: string, x: number): string
function palette(c1: string, c2: string, clim: range): number => string
```

# Documentation

Below is the full documentation for the core `gum.jsx` components: `Element`, `Group`, and `Box`. All of the other components are derived from these and many use them as sub-components. Understanding these three components will give you a good foundation for working with the library.

## Element

The base class for all Gum objects. You will usually not be working with this object directly unless you are implementing your own custom elements. However, many of the arguments are common to all elements and are documented here.

The position and size of an element are specified in the internal coordinates (`coord`) of its parent, which defaults to the unit square. Rectangles are always specified in `[left, top, right, bottom]` format. Where the element is placed is ultimately determined by its `rect`. However, it is more common to specify the `rect` using one of the convenience parameters below.

There are several convenience parameters that can be used to specify the `rect` in a more intuitive way. These include `size`/`xsize`/`ysize` for controlling the extent of the rectangle around `pos` and the analogous `rad`/`xrad`/`yrad` for radial specification. You can also specify the limits in either or both dimensions with `xrect`/`yrect`, where a single number is interpreted as a zero-length limit at that position.

The `expand` parameter can be used to control whether the element should be expanded to fully contain its `rect`. This is useful if you have an aspected element with a desired size in one dimension. A very common case is a **Text** element where you specify `pos` and `ysize` and leave the width to be determined by the aspect ratio.

Parameters:
- `aspect` = `null` — the width to height ratio for this element
- `rect` — a fully specified rectangle to place the child in (takes precedence over other parameters)
- `pos` — the desired position of the center of the child's rectangle
- `size`/`xsize`/`ysize` ­— the desired size of the child's rectangle (`size` can be single number or pair)
- `rad`/`xrad`/`yrad` — the desired radius of the child's rectangle (`rad` can be single number or pair)
- `xrect`/`yrect` — the limits of the child's rectangle in the x and y dimensions (both can be single number or pair)
- `expand` — when `true`, instead of embedding the child within `rect`, it will make the child just large enough to fully contain `rect`
- `align` — how to align the child when it doesn't fit exactly within `rect`, options are `left`, `right`, `center`, or a fractional position (can set vertical and horizontal separately with a pair)
- `rotate` — how much to rotate the child by (degrees counterclockwise)
- `spin` — like rotate but will maintain the same size
- `flex` ­— override to set `aspect = null`
- `...` = `{}` — additional attributes are applied directly to the resulting SVG

**Example**

Prompt: draw a 2x1 rectangle in red with a blue square embedded within it

Generated code:
```jsx
<Group aspect={2}>
  <Rect stroke={red} />
  <Square stroke={blue} />
</Group>
```

## Group

*Inherits*: **Element**

This is the main container class that all compound elements are derived from. It accepts a list of child elements and attempts to place them according to their declared properties. Child placement positions are specified in the group's internal coordinates (`coord`), which defaults to the unit square. The coordinate space is specified in `[left, top, right, bottom]` format.

The child's `aspect` is an important determinant of its placement. When the child does not have an aspect, it will fit exactly in the given `rect`. When it does have an aspect, it will be made as large as possible while still fitting in the given `rect`. The `align` argument governs the exact placement in this case, while the `expand` flag makes it as small as possible while still covering the given `rect`.

One common pitfall: using `coord` will affect that placement of child elements. But for graphing elements like **Line** or **Points**, their `points` values are evaluate based on their own coordinate system, not the containing **Group**'s. You must either give them their own `coord` or use **Graph**, which automatically propagates the coordinate system to all children.

To help with debugging, a `debug` flag can be passed to show stencil lines indicating the childrens' placement. The allocated space is shown in dashed blue, while the realized position (accounting for aspect and alignment) is shown in dashed red.

Parameters:
- `children` = `[]` — a list of child elements
- `aspect` = `null` — the aspect ratio of the group's rectangle (can pass `'auto'` to infer from the children)
- `coord` = `[0, 0, 1, 1]` — the internal coordinate space to use for child elements (can pass `'auto'` to contain children's rects)
- `clip` = `false` — clip children to the group's rectangle if `true` (or a custom shape if specified)
- `debug` = `false` — show debug boxes for the children

**Example**

Prompt: a square in the top left and a circle in the bottom right

Generated code:
```jsx
<Group>
  <Rectangle pos={[0.3, 0.3]} size={0.2} spin={15} />
  <Ellipse pos={[0.7, 0.7]} size={0.2} />
</Group>
```

## Box

*Inherits*: **Group** > **Element**

This is a simple container class allowing you to add padding, margins, and a border to a single **Element**. It's pretty versatile and is often used to set up the outermost positioning of a figure. Mirroring the standard CSS definitions, padding is space inside the border and margin is space outside the border. This has no border by default, but there is a specialized subclass of this called **Frame** that defaults to `border = 1`.

**Box** can be pretty handly in various situations. It is differentiated from **Group** in that it will adopt the `aspect` of the first child element. This is useful if you want to do something like shift an element up or down by a certain amount while maintaining its aspect ratio. Simply wrap it in a **Box** and set child's `pos` to the desired offset.

There are multiple ways to specify padding and margins. If given as a scalar, it is constant across all sides. If two values are given, they correspond to the horizontal and vertical sides. If four values are given, they correspond to `[left, top, right, bottom]`.

The `adjust` flag controls whether padding/margins are adjusted for the aspect ratio. If `true`, horizontal and vertical components are scaled so that their ratio is equal to the `child` element's aspect ratio. This yields padding/margins of constant apparent size regardless of aspect ratio. If `false`, the inputs are used as-is.

Parameters:
- `padding` = `0` / `0.1` — the padding to be added (inside border)
- `margin` = `0` / `0.1` — the margin to be added (outside border)
- `border` = `0` / `1` — the border width to use (stroke in pixels)
- `rounded` = `0` / `0.1` — the border rounding to use (proportional to the box size)
- `fill` = `null` — the background color to use (default is no fill)
- `adjust` = `true` — whether to adjust values for aspect ratio
- `shape` = `Rect` — the shape class to use for the border
- `clip` = `false` — whether to clip the contents to the border shape

Subunit names:
- `border` — keywords to pass to border, such as `stroke` or `stroke-dasharray`

**Example**

Prompt: the text "hello!" in a frame with a dashed border and rounded corners

Generated code:
```jsx
<Box padding border rounded border-stroke-dasharray={5}>
  <Text>hello!</Text>
</Box>
```

# References

Below is a list of topics to reference for documentation and usage examples for the various components. Every `gum.jsx` component is documented here. Your code must either use these components or create its own custom components. Before using a component, be sure to read the relevant reference to fully understand its parameters and capabilities.

## Layout

**File**: [layout](references/layout.md)

These are the raw layout components that assist you in arranging elements in a figure. They typically take a list of child elements and arrange them in a specified way. `Box` is a simple container element that can be used to add padding, border, and rounded corners to a group of elements.

`Stack` lets you arrange elements in a vertical or horizontal stack (like `flexbox` in CSS) in a way that respects the aspect ratio of the child elements. Typically you would use the specialized subclasses `VStack` and `HStack` for vertical and horizontal stacks, respectively. `Grid` does something similar but for a 2D grid of rows and columns (like `grid` in CSS).

`Points` is different in that it takes a list of locations and arranges a given element at each of those locations (with the default element being `Dot`, a solid filled `Circle`).

**Components**:
- *Box*: a box with a padding, border, and rounded corners
- *Stack*/*VStack*/*HStack*: arrange elements vertically or horizontally
- *Grid*: arrange elements in a grid of specified size
- *Points*: arrange one element at each of a list of locations

## Shapes

**File**: [shapes](references/shapes.md)

These are the basic geometric shapes that can be used to create more complex figures. Both `Rect` and `Ellipse` are aspectless by default but can be given an aspect ratio to control their shape (i.e., a circle is an `Ellipse` with an aspect of `1`).

`Line` is actually more general than just a single straight line. It can be used to draw piecewise linear paths by passing a list of points. For the case of simple unit lines, use `UnitLine` and its specialized variants `VLine` and `HLine` instead. For closed paths, either pass `closed` to `Line` or use `Polygon` instead.

For multi-segment Bézier splines, `Spline` is the way to go. It takes a list of control points and draws a smooth cubic spline through them. You can control the tension of the spline with the `curve` parameter (default is `0.5`). This also accepts a `closed` parameter to draw a closed spline.

**Components**:
- *Rect*: a rectangle
- *Ellipse*: an ellipse
- *Line*/*Polygon*: a piecewise linear path (possibly closed)
- *Spline*: a multi-segment Bézier spline (possibly closed)
- *UnitLine*/*VLine*/*HLine*: a single unit line
- *Arrow*: a straight line arrow between two points

## Text

**File**: [text](references/text.md)

These are components that can be used to create text elements. `Text` is a fairly sophisticated component that handles text wrapping, line spacing, and other text-related features. You can specify the wrap width (in "ems", that is, in proportion to the line height) with the `wrap` parameter and the alignment with the `justify` parameter. Feel free to intersperse non-text elements with text elements to create more complex layouts.

`TextStack` is a simple component that stacks text elements vertically. Specifying a `wrap` width will cause every child element to be wrapped to the specified width. You can specify the vertical spacing between the elements with the `spacing` parameter. The `TitleFrame` is a `Frame` subclass that automatically adds a boxed title to the top of the frame. Finally, `Slide` is basically a `TextStack` wrapped in a `TitleFrame`.

`Latex` does what it sounds like: it renders a single LaTeX equation. This uses MathJax under the hood, so it supports most but not all inline LaTeX features.

**Components**:
- *Text*: a text element with wrapping
- *TextStack*: a stack of text elements
- *TitleFrame*: a frame with a title
- *Slide*: a slide with a title and content

## Math

**File**: [math](references/math.md)

These are components for creating mathematical expressions. By far the most common usage is to pass a LaTeX style math expression to the `Latex` component. However, you can get very fine grained control over the layout of mathematical expressions with `MathText` as your outer wrapper and the `SupSub`, `Frac`, and `Bracket` components.

**Components**:
- *Latex*: a single LaTeX equation from a string
- *MathText*: display a list of math components
- *SupSub*: a superscript and/or subscript
- *Frac*: a fraction (numerator/denominator)
- *Bracket*: auto-sized brackets (round, square, curly, angle, or custom)

## Symbolic

**File**: [symbolic](references/symbolic.md)

These components allow you to plot functions symbolically. That is, they accept functions as arguments and plot them accordingly. Functions can be specified as [x => y], [y => x], or [t => (x,y)]. You can control the range over which the domain is sampled with the `tlim`/`xlim`/`ylim` parameters. You can also control the number of samples to take with the `N` parameter.

These clearly extend their non-`Sym` counterparts by adding the ability to plot functions symbolically. The only additional element is `SymFill`, which plots a filled area between two functions. For this one, passing a constant to either `fy1` or `fy2` is equivalent to passing a constant function.

**Components**:
- *SymPoints*: plot points functionally
- *SymLine*/*SymPoly*: plot a curve functionally (possibly closed)
- *SymSpline*: plot a Bézier spline functionally (possibly closed)
- *SymFill*: plot a filled area between two functions

## Plotting

**File**: [plotting](references/plotting.md)

There are components for creating various types of plots. The core element is `Graph`, which is a container element that accepts a list of children to plot over a specified coordinate system (`xlim`/`ylim`/`coord`). `Plot` is a `Graph` subclass that adds axes (with `Axis`/`HAxis`/`VAxis`), labels, and other plot-specific features. `BarPlot` is a help element that wraps a `Bars` element inside of a `Plot`.

The `Plot` element in particular is highly customizable, and you can pass arguments to sub-components using `axis`/`label`/`title` prefixes. For instance, to specify the stroke width of the x-axis, you can use `xaxis-stroke-width`. This logic applies to other types of compound components as well.

**Components**:
- *Graph*: a graph containing multiple elements with a specified coordinate system
- *Plot*: a plot containing a graph, axes, and labels
- *Axis*/*HAxis*/*VAxis*: a single axis for a plot
- *Bars*/*BarPlot*: a bar plot (bare or wrapped in a `Plot`)

## Networks

**File**: [networks](references/networks.md)

These are components for creating network diagrams. The core element is `Network`, which is a container element that accepts a list of `Node`s and `Edge`s, as well as potentially other elements like labels. A `Node` can specify an `id` to be used to reference it from an `Edge` as either the source (`from`) or destination (`to`). Default values for `Node` and `Edge` arguments can be specified with `node-` and `edge-` prefixed arguments passed to the `Network` element.

The `Edge` element has a `dir1` and `dir2` parameter to specify the direction of the arrowhead for the source and destination nodes, respectively. You can also toggle arrowheads on either side with `arrow`/`from-arrow`/`to-arrow` or specify the `curve` parameter to control the curvature of the edge.

**Components**:
- *ArrowSpline*: a curved path with optional arrowheads at either or both ends
- *Node*: a node in a network
- *Edge*: an edge in a network
- *Network*: a network containing nodes and edges

## Utilities

**File**: [utilities](references/utilities.md)

These are the helper functions that are available in the library. They are not components themselves, but they are useful for creating and manipulating data. Many of them mimic the behavior of their counterparts in Python and `numpy` and are useful for generating `Element` objects from arrays. There are also some commonly used mathematical constants and tools for interpolating colors.

**Components**:
- *Math*: mathematical functions
- *Arrays*: array operations
- *Colors*: color operations
- *Tables*: loading data tables from CSV files
- *Images*: loading images from PNG files

# Using CLI commands

To test the output of a particular Gum JSX snippet or file, you can pipe it to the `gum` command. If this command is not available globally, try to install the `gum-jsx` package with Bun (preferred) or NPM.

If you have vision capabilities, seeing an actual image can be useful for see the actual output of the code, either in SVG or PNG format. Even without vision, one can infer properties of the output by reading the SVG output directly.

For one off tests, pipe the code using `echo`. It is recommended that you use single quotes as the outer delimiter, to accommodate code that includes double quotes for component properties (e.g. `justify="left"`).

For more difficult tasks, use a file provide the filename as an argument or `cat` it in. Using a file allows you to view and refine your code repeatedly. If you wish to avoid output redirection to a file, use the `-o` option to write to a file.

In general, it makes a lot of sense to write a draft to a file, view its output, then refine the code until you're satisfied. This way you can start simple and add complexity as needed. When in doubt, write the output file to the same directory as the input file with the same base name but with the appropriate extension.

**Examples:**
```bash
# generate an .svg file from a .jsx file
gum test.jsx -o test.svg

# generate a .png file from a .jsx file
gum test.jsx -o test.png

# generate SVG from a Gum JSX snippet and print to stdout
echo '<Rectangle rounded fill={blue} />' | gum

# generate PNG from a Gum JSX snippet and save to file
echo '<Rectangle rounded fill={blue} />' | gum -o test.png
```

**CLI options:**
- `file`: Gum JSX file to render (reads from stdin if not provided)
- `-t, --theme <theme>`: theme to use (default: light)
- `-b, --background <color>`: background color (default: white)
- `-f, --format <format>`: output format: json, svg, png, kitty (default: auto)
- `-o, --output <output>`: output file (default: stdout)
- `-s, --size <size>`: size of the SVG (default: 1000)
- `-w, --width <width>`: max width of the PNG (default: null)
- `-h, --height <height>`: max height of the PNG (default: null)

# Using Gum in TypeScript

There are a couple of ways to use Gum in TypeScript. You can evaluate JSX strings directly, or you can construct Gum components directly. If you want to use Gum components in React, you can use the `react-gum-jsx` package.

## Evaluating JSX strings

The `evaluateGum` function from `gum-jsx/eval` parses a JSX string and returns an `Svg` element tree. Call `.svg()` on the result to get an SVG string.

```typescript
import { evaluateGum } from 'gum-jsx/eval'
import { rasterizeSvg } from 'gum-jsx/render'
import { writeFileSync } from 'fs'

// parse JSX string into element tree, then render to SVG
const tree = evaluateGum('<Rectangle rounded fill={blue} />')
const svg = tree.svg()

// render to PNG buffer
const png = rasterizeSvg(svg, {
    size: tree.size,
    background: 'white',
})
writeFileSync('output.png', png)
```

The `evaluateGum` function accepts options for theme, size, and extra context variables:

```typescript
const tree = evaluateGum(code, {
    theme: 'light',
    size: 500,
})
```

## Using components directly

You can also construct Gum components directly by importing them from `gum-jsx` and calling their constructors. Each component takes a single args object.

```typescript
import { Svg, Rectangle, Circle, HStack, Text, blue, red, white } from 'gum-jsx'

// create elements by calling constructors directly
const rect = new Square({ rounded: true, fill: blue })
const circle = new Circle({ fill: red })
const label = new Text({ children: ['Hello'], fill: white })
const layout = new HStack({ children: [rect, circle, label], spacing: 0.1 })

// wrap in Svg and render
const tree = new Svg({ children: [layout], size: 500 })
const svg = tree.svg()
```

When constructing manually, note that:
- `children` is always passed as an array in the args object
- Constants like `blue`, `red`, `none`, etc. are exported from `gum-jsx`
- Utility functions like `range`, `linspace`, `zip` are also available from `gum-jsx`
- Call `.svg()` on the top-level `Svg` element to get the SVG string output
- The realized size of the SVG is available on the `Svg` element as `size`

## Using in React with `react-gum-jsx`

You can use Gum components directly in React components by importing from the `react-gum-jsx` package. This is useful for creating interactive visualizations in React.

Here's an example of how to use Gum in a React component. It's basically the same as what you would pass to `evaluateGum` but as a default export:

```tsx
import { blue, red } from 'gum-jsx'
import { GUM } from 'react-gum-jsx'
const { Frame, HStack, Square, Circle, Text } = GUM

export default function Demo() {
  return <Frame padding margin rounded>
    <HStack padding>
      <Square fill={blue} />
      <Circle fill={red} />
      <Text>Hello</Text>
    </HStack>
  </Frame>
}
```

To run this in a CLI setting, just pass a file with a default export to the `gum-react` command that comes with the `react-gum-jsx` package. This takes very similar arguments to the regular `gum` command.

If you are in a web setting, you'll need to wrap this export in a `<Gum>` component, which takes roughly the same arguments as `evaluateGum`. This would look like:

```tsx
import { Gum } from 'react-gum-jsx'
<Gum size={[640, 360]}>
  <Demo />
</Gum>
```

If the inner component has an `aspect` it will be embedded inside the given size bounds. If it is aspectless, it will be stretched to fill the given size bounds.
