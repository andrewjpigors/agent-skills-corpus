description: One orchestration cycle of the PR review pipeline (Agent B). Designed to be invoked by `/loop /pr-orch-tick` inside a long-running tmux daemon session, sibling to `/pr-review-tick` (Agent A). Each tick discovers opted-in PRs (those with the `[auto PR loop]` marker in title or body) that have a new review comment from Agent A, captures the current head SHA as the per-snapshot target, spawns a fix worker sub-agent in a detached-HEAD worktree pinned to that SHA (avoiding collisions with concurrent worktrees / external agents), applies fixes with `[auto N/4]` tagged commits, and pushes via `--force-with-lease` so external commits never get clobbered. After the worker reports "no more actionable findings", runs the merge-gate verdict — auto-merge if eligible, otherwise post a "fixes pushed; manual merge required" comment without freezing the PR. Use this whenever the user says "start the orchestrator daemon", "Agent B", "kick off the orch tick", or `/loop /pr-orch-tick`. NEVER reviews PRs (that's Agent A's job). Caps at `max_rounds=4` per snapshot; refuses to auto-merge external contributor PRs regardless of dry-run state; respects per-PR `flock` so it never collides with Agent A. Per-snapshot accountability: once a head SHA is acted on, the loop won't re-engage on the same SHA — but ANY new commit to the branch re-engages automatically.

# PR orchestration tick — Agent B of the PR review pipeline

A single orchestration cycle. Designed to be invoked by `/loop /pr-orch-tick`
in a long-running tmux Claude Code session (one per repo, sibling to the
`/pr-review-tick` daemon). Self-paces via `ScheduleWakeup` at the end of
every tick. State persists across ticks on disk; context loss between
iterations is harmless.

## Architecture context

See `pr-review-tick/SKILL.md` for the full pipeline diagram. This skill
is the **fix + verdict** half:

- Agent A reviews → posts ONE comment per PR per new HEAD SHA.
- **This skill** triages that comment → spawns a fix worker → after the
  worker says "no more findings worth fixing" → runs the merge-gate
  verdict → either dry-run comment / real merge / escalate to user.

This skill MUST NOT review PRs. Reviewing is Agent A's job. If you
find yourself wanting to "double-check Agent A's findings against the
actual code," stop — that's a fix-worker concern (the worker triages
into (a) worth fixing / (b) wrong analysis / (c) not worth), not an
orchestrator concern.

## Anti-improvisation principle

This SKILL is iteratively hardened against daemon improvisation.
Past observation: when this SKILL didn't explicitly cover some
corner of a problem, Opus xhigh's reasoning has repeatedly filled
the gap by **inventing its own mechanism** — and those inventions
have consistently failed cleanup, leaving the pipeline in stuck
states the operator has to manually unjam.

**When you hit a situation the SKILL doesn't obviously cover, the
answer is NEVER:**

- Inventing your own state-file name not in the documented list
- Using fd numbers other than what's documented (fd 9 for flock)
- Spawning background processes (`sleep N &`, `disown`, `nohup`)
  for state management
- Writing event types or fields to `verdict_log.jsonl` that aren't
  documented
- Reading `verdict_log.jsonl` as a state-recovery source on restart
  (it's human audit only)
- Bumping `last_reviewed_sha` / `last_reviewed_at` without actually
  running a fresh review (Agent A-side concern; mirrored here for
  reference)

**The answer IS:**

- Do the minimal thing this SKILL DOES say
- If genuinely stuck, post a `gh pr comment` naming the gap and stop
- Let the operator update the SKILL on observation

**Anti-pattern catalogue (past incidents — don't repeat):**

| Improvisation | Why daemon thought it was clever | Why it broke |
|---|---|---|
| `escalated_at` permanent freeze | "We already gave up, mark it" | Deprecated; replaced by per-SHA `last_escalated_sha` |
| Mining `verdict_log.jsonl` for past escalation events | "Consistent with history" | Old log entries from pre-rewrite SKILL poisoned new ticks |
| `sleep 7200 &` + `fd 200` to hold flock cross-tick | "Keep A out while worker fixes" | Orphan sleep held lock 2h after orch tick exited |
| Same-SHA `last_reviewed_sha` rebump without re-review | "SHA unchanged, log it as still reviewed" | Wrote partial state without findings → Agent B saw "reviewed but nothing to fix" |
| Pre-flight bailout on "diff too big to merge" | "Save worker compute" | Worker MUST run for opted-in PRs; auto-merge is decided POST-fix |

**Enforcement layer**: `~/.claude/hooks/block-pipeline-improvisations.sh`
(PreToolUse / Bash) deterministically blocks the specific bash
patterns those improvisations need. The hook is reactive (covers
patterns we've seen) — new improvisations will create new incidents
and new hook entries. If a hook blocks you, READ the hook's stderr
to see which SKILL rule you violated and follow it.

## Orchestrator role: read-only contract

The orchestrator (this skill, running as the top-level Claude in the
daemon's tmux session) is **strictly read-only with respect to code**.
Only the worker (sub-agent spawned via `Agent`) is allowed to modify
files or commit code.

**The orchestrator NEVER:**
- Modifies code (no `Edit`, `Write`, `NotebookEdit`)
- Runs `git commit` / `git add` / `git push` / `git rebase` /
  `git merge` / `git revert` / `git reset --hard` / `git cherry-pick` /
  `git stash` / `git apply` in any repo
- Modifies CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / specs / source files / tests /
  configs
- Stages anything in any repo

**The orchestrator ONLY:**
- Reads PR / repo state via `gh` and read-only `git` ops
  (`status` / `log` / `diff` / `show` / `rev-parse` / `worktree list`)
- Manages worktrees: `git worktree add` / `git worktree remove`
  (plumbing, not code mutation)
- Spawns workers via `Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", ...)` —
  the worker does ALL the writing
- Posts PR comments via `gh pr comment` / `gh api`
- Runs `gh pr merge` at the verdict gate (note: `gh pr merge`, NOT
  `git merge` — different commands; the latter is forbidden)
- Writes orchestrator state metadata under
  `~/.local/state/claude-pr-pipeline/` via Bash redirections
  (`echo X > file`, `jq ... >> file`)

**Enforcement (two layers):**

1. **Layer 0 (this prose):** the prompt-level prohibition above.
   LLMs sometimes attempt forbidden actions despite explicit rules,
   so this layer alone is not sufficient.

2. **Layer 2 (hook):** `~/.claude/hooks/block-orchestrator-writes.sh`,
   gated on the env var `CLAUDE_ROLE=orchestrator`. The hook runs in
   `PreToolUse` and **deterministically blocks** Edit/Write/NotebookEdit
   tools and the forbidden `git` / `sed -i` / `perl -i` Bash patterns.
   This is the equivalent of "removing those tools" for a top-level
   Claude — Claude Code does not natively support per-role tool
   removal for top-level sessions, so a hook gated on env var is the
   cleanest available mechanism.

   (Layer 1 — physically removing the tools — only applies cleanly to
   sub-agents, where `subagent_type` determines the tool set. Top-level
   Claude reads tools from `settings.json`, which has no env-var
   conditional. The hook is the practical equivalent.)

**To launch the daemon with the role correctly set:**

```bash
CLAUDE_ROLE=orchestrator claude --resume <session>
# or if starting fresh:
CLAUDE_ROLE=orchestrator claude
```

If the daemon is launched without `CLAUDE_ROLE=orchestrator`, the hook
is a no-op and the orchestrator can write code — **this is a bug in
the launch, not a feature**. Verify with:

```bash
echo "$CLAUDE_ROLE"  # should print "orchestrator" inside the daemon
```

**One-off bypass:** if you genuinely need the orchestrator to write
something (e.g., debugging the daemon itself, not running a tick),
relaunch with `ORCHESTRATOR_WRITES_OK=1` set. Don't bypass casually.

## When to use

Trigger phrases:
- `/loop /pr-orch-tick` (the canonical invocation)
- "start the orchestrator daemon for this repo"
- "do one PR orch tick"
- "Agent B: run a tick"

Pre-conditions (in addition to Agent A's):
- `git worktree` is available (it always is on git 2.5+).
- The current working directory of the daemon is a git worktree of
  the target repo (we'll spawn temp worktrees from it via
  `git worktree add`).
- Branch protection rules on the repo allow `gh pr merge` from the
  authenticated user, **OR** the user has set up auto-merge admin
  override.

## State

Shares the per-repo state directory with Agent A:

```
~/.local/state/claude-pr-pipeline/
  <owner>__<repo>/
    pr-<N>/
      lock                      # shared with Agent A — flock(1)
      last_reviewed_sha         # Agent A writes; Agent B reads
      last_reviewed_id          # Agent A writes; Agent B reads
      author_association        # Agent A writes; Agent B reads
      last_findings.jsonl       # Agent A writes; Agent B reads

      last_orch_round           # this skill writes: 0..max_rounds
      last_orch_action_at       # ISO timestamp of last commit/push by worker
      consecutive_no_actionable # this skill writes: 0..2
      last_orch_round_sha       # SHA we last completed a round on (worker pushed OR no actionable findings OR verdict-fail commented)
      last_escalated_sha        # SHA we hit max_rounds on; loop skips this exact SHA, re-engages when head moves
      verdict_log.jsonl         # one record per verdict gate evaluation
    dry_run                     # repo-scoped flag file; presence = dry-run mode
```

**State files Agent B writes — exhaustive list.** Only these. If you find
yourself reaching for a different state-file name (especially
`escalated_at` from older SKILL revisions): STOP. That field is gone.
Use `last_escalated_sha` (per-SHA, auto-invalidates on new commits)
or `last_orch_round_sha` (per-SHA round bookkeeping).

The `dry_run` flag file is at the **repo level**, not per-PR. New repos
should have it created on daemon startup; user `rm`s it after observed
sane verdicts to flip to real-merge mode.

## Operating regime: aggressive fix, conservative merge

This pipeline runs in a regime where **per-tick compute is effectively
free** (the daemon's backend has high quota). The design implication:

- **Don't ever pre-flight-bailout on "this PR seems hard"** (diff too big,
  merge conflict with main, lots of files). Aggressively fixing is cheap;
  if it produces useful commits the human author benefits even if the
  PR ultimately gets merged by hand. The opt-in marker is consent; honor it.
- **Don't ever skip a worker round to "save compute."** Compute is not the
  bottleneck. Quality is.
- **Auto-merge is conservative** — even in the unlimited-compute regime,
  shipping bad code to main is the real failure mode. The verdict gate
  still gates on correctness signals (CI green, codex finds no [P0],
  worker confidence, internal author), but NOT on heuristics that exist
  to "save compute" or "avoid wasting a round" (diff size caps, path
  blacklists). Those got removed — they were Era-1 budget proxies, not
  quality signals.

## The hard cap: max_rounds = 4

After 4 rounds of fix-and-push on the same PR with findings still
actionable, **stop**. Don't run a 5th. The reason this cap exists is
**structural sanity, not budget**: if 4 rounds of Opus+codex review +
fix didn't close findings, what we're hitting is one of:
- The worker is chasing false positives that Agent A's reviewers keep
  re-flagging (a structural review-loop bug)
- The PR has an architectural issue that the local fix worker can't
  resolve without out-of-scope changes
- A genuinely complex change Agent B isn't designed to ship autonomously

All three are operator-escalation cases.

`last_orch_round` is the canonical counter. Worker commit messages
embed `[auto N/4]` so the cap is auditable from `git log` alone.

## Per-tick procedure

### 1. Pre-flight

Same dependency checks as `pr-review-tick` plus:

```bash
# Verify we can git worktree
git worktree --help >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo "[pr-orch-tick] git too old"; exit 1; }
```

Resolve `REPO_SLUG` and `STATE_ROOT` identically to Agent A.

If `STATE_ROOT/dry_run` doesn't exist on first run for a new repo,
**create it**. New repos default to dry-run mode per the pipeline
design.

### 1.5. Wake-up channels — MANDATORY at every tick

> **YOU MUST DO THIS STEP. DO NOT PROCEED TO STEP 2 UNTIL BOTH CHANNELS
> ARE VERIFIED RUNNING.** This is not optional, not "set up once and
> forget", not "if convenient". Every tick verifies both, repairs any
> that died.
>
> Past observation: daemons that skipped this step ended
> up with 10-minute cron + no Monitor at all, missing every fast A→B
> handoff. The user had to manually intervene to fix the cadence after
> noticing the staleness. Don't be that daemon.

Two wake channels. Without BOTH, the daemon either misses fast events
(Channel 2 dead) or has no liveness guarantee (Channel 1 dead).

**`/loop` dynamic ScheduleWakeup is unavailable** — the harness rejects
it with "/loop dynamic gate off" inside cron-driven daemons. So
ScheduleWakeup is NOT a substitute for either channel below. Don't
attempt it as a fallback.

#### Channel 1: cron heartbeat (every 2 minutes — MANDATORY)

```python
# Verify the cron job exists AND has the right interval. If it has the
# wrong interval (e.g., */10), DELETE it and recreate with */2.
existing = CronList()
correct = False
to_delete = []
for j in existing.get("jobs", []):
    if j.get("prompt") == "/loop /pr-orch-tick":
        if j.get("cron") == "*/2 * * * *":
            correct = True
        else:
            to_delete.append(j["id"])  # wrong interval

for jid in to_delete:
    CronDelete(id=jid)

if not correct:
    CronCreate(
        cron="*/2 * * * *",        # MANDATORY: every 2 minutes
        prompt="/loop /pr-orch-tick",
        recurring=True,
        durable=False,
    )
```

**`*/2`, NOT `*/5` or `*/10`.** Copilot Enterprise quota is effectively
unlimited so 5x more ticks costs $0. The user expects PR fixes to land
within minutes of A's review, not within 10–15 minutes.

#### Channel 2: Monitor on `notify_orch` (event-driven, ~2s latency — MANDATORY)

Agent A writes `$STATE_ROOT/notify_orch` after posting any review
comment. We watch its mtime via a python3 polling loop and emit one
stdout line per change → arrives as a notification → daemon wakes for
an immediate tick.

> **CRITICAL: `Monitor` is a deferred tool.** Past observation
>: daemons claimed "no Monitor tool available in this
> harness" and skipped Channel 2 entirely. The fix is to call
> `ToolSearch(query="select:Monitor")` first to load Monitor's
> schema into this session — only after that can `Monitor()` be
> invoked. **Do this even if you've never seen Monitor before; it's
> always available, just lazy-loaded.**

```python
import os

# Step 0 of Channel 2: load Monitor's schema. WITHOUT this, Monitor()
# below will silently fail / be reported as unavailable.
ToolSearch(query="select:Monitor")

notify_path = f"{STATE_ROOT}/notify_orch"
marker = f"{STATE_ROOT}/.monitor_pid"

# Verify the existing Monitor is alive via PID-marker check.
already_alive = False
if os.path.exists(marker):
    try:
        pid = int(open(marker).read().strip())
        os.kill(pid, 0)  # signal 0 = existence check; raises if dead
        already_alive = True
    except (ProcessLookupError, ValueError, FileNotFoundError):
        pass

if not already_alive:
    Monitor(
        persistent=True,
        description=f"notify_orch mtime change for {REPO_SLUG}",
        command=f'''
python3 -c '
import os, time
with open("{marker}", "w") as f: f.write(str(os.getpid()))
last = 0
while True:
    try:
        m = os.stat("{notify_path}").st_mtime
        if m > last:
            if last != 0:
                print(f"NOTIFY_ORCH_MODIFIED ts={{int(m)}}", flush=True)
            last = m
    except FileNotFoundError:
        pass
    time.sleep(2)
'
        ''',
        timeout_ms=3600000,
    )
```

When a `NOTIFY_ORCH_MODIFIED` line arrives as notification, run another
`/pr-orch-tick` IMMEDIATELY. Don't wait for the next 2-minute cron fire.

#### Step-1.5 verification checklist (run before exiting step 1.5)

- [ ] `CronList()` shows a `/loop /pr-orch-tick` entry with `cron="*/2 * * * *"`
- [ ] `~/.local/state/.../$REPO_SLUG/.monitor_pid` exists and points at a live PID
- [ ] If either is missing, fix it now before going to step 2

If both green, proceed to step 2.

### 2. Discover work

#### 2a. Opt-in keyword filter — `[auto PR loop]` (MANDATORY, same as Agent A)

> **Agent B only touches PRs the author has explicitly opted in.**
> A PR is opted in iff its **title** OR the **first 500 characters of
> its body** contain the case-insensitive marker `[auto PR loop]`
> (brackets required, internal whitespace flexible). Any PR without
> the marker MUST be skipped — even if it has a `pr-<N>/` state dir
> from a previous opt-in cycle (the author may have removed the marker
> as an off-switch).

```python
import re
OPT_IN_RE = re.compile(r"\[\s*auto\s+PR\s+loop\s*\]", re.IGNORECASE)

def is_opted_in(pr):
    title = pr.get("title", "") or ""
    body  = (pr.get("body", "") or "")[:500]
    return bool(OPT_IN_RE.search(title) or OPT_IN_RE.search(body))
```

Pull `gh pr list --state open --json number,title,body,headRefOid,isDraft`
once at tick start, filter to opted-in non-drafts.

If empty: log and re-arm. No fix work this tick.

#### 2b. Per-PR work selection (only for opted-in PRs)

For each opted-in PR:

```bash
PR_DIR="$STATE_ROOT/pr-$N"
[[ -d "$PR_DIR" ]] || continue   # Agent A hasn't reviewed this PR yet
```

A PR needs orchestrator attention if:
- `last_reviewed_sha` exists (Agent A reviewed it)
- AND `last_reviewed_sha == pr.headRefOid` (the review still matches
  the current head — if the head moved, wait for Agent A's next tick
  to re-review the new SHA before we fix)
- AND we haven't already finished a round on THIS SHA (see "snapshot
  contract" below)
- AND the most recent issue/review comment from us (the daemon's
  GitHub identity) on this PR is OLDER than `last_reviewed_at`.

#### 2c. Snapshot contract: per-(PR, head-sha) accountability

> **Agent B's commitment scope is a single (PR, head-sha) snapshot.**
> When we start a round, we capture `TARGET_SHA = pr.headRefOid` and
> drive THAT snapshot toward "fix commit pushed". We are NOT
> responsible for what happens to the branch afterwards (the author
> may push more commits, another agent may rebase, etc.). Our
> contract per snapshot:
>
>   1. Read Agent A's findings on this SHA.
>   2. Worker fixes the (a) bucket on a worktree pinned to this SHA.
>   3. Push the fix with `--force-with-lease=<branch>:<TARGET_SHA>`
>      so external commits don't get clobbered.
>   4. Either auto-merge (if verdict gate passes) OR post a "fixes
>      pushed, manual merge required" comment.
>   5. Stamp `last_orch_round_sha = TARGET_SHA` and stop.
>
> If the push fails (`--force-with-lease` rejected → branch moved):
> drop the work, do NOT retry within this tick. Next tick Agent A
> will re-review the new head; we'll come back fresh.

Cap on this snapshot: at most `max_rounds=4` consecutive worker
rounds on the SAME PR (across multiple SHAs in the same loop session).
After 4 rounds with findings still actionable, post a
"max-rounds-reached" comment and stop touching the PR **until its
head moves to a SHA we haven't acted on**. Track via `last_escalated_sha`:

```python
last_esc = read_optional(f"{PR_DIR}/last_escalated_sha")
if last_esc and last_esc == pr.headRefOid:
    continue   # we already escalated on this exact SHA; wait for new commit
```

This is the replacement for the old `escalated_at` permanent freeze.
The author can always push a new commit (or rebase) to re-engage Agent B.

If no PR needs attention this tick, re-arm and exit.

### 3. Acquire the per-PR lock

**Use EXACTLY this pattern. No improvisation.**

```bash
exec 9>"$PR_DIR/lock"
flock -n -x 9 || { echo "[pr-orch-tick] PR #$N busy with Agent A, retry next tick"; continue; }
```

Constraints (enforced both by SKILL prose AND by
`~/.claude/hooks/block-pipeline-improvisations.sh`):

- fd MUST be `9`. Not `200`, not `100`, not `300`. The hook blocks
  any `exec [3-9][0-9]+>` redirecting to a pipeline state file.
- Lock auto-releases when **this tick exits** — that's by design.
- Do NOT spawn `sleep N &` / `disown` / `nohup` / any process trick
  to hold the lock cross-tick. The hook blocks `sleep [0-9]{3,}.*&`
  in commands touching pipeline state.
- If you think you "need" cross-tick holding (e.g. to keep Agent A
  out during the worker run): you don't. flock just prevents
  simultaneous A+B on the SAME PR within ONE tick boundary. The
  worker is invoked via `Agent` tool inside this tick, and the tick
  doesn't release until the Agent returns. Cross-tick coordination
  comes from disk state files, not flock.

If you hit a flock situation the SKILL doesn't cover, log it via
`gh pr comment` (visible to the user) and stop — DO NOT improvise.

### 4. Spawn the fix worker

By the time we reach this step we passed steps 1.5/2a/2b/2c/3, so the
contract holds: opted-in PR + new findings + we haven't completed a
round on THIS SHA yet. **Spawn the worker — there is no further
pre-worker filter.** Compute is not the bottleneck; the worker runs.

The verdict gate (step 7) runs AFTER the worker finishes, never as a
look-ahead. If the gate ultimately won't pass (e.g. CI red), that's
handled by step 7c (post a "manual-merge note") — that's still useful
work because the worker's fix commit lands on the branch regardless
of whether auto-merge can happen.

The worker runs in an **isolated git worktree pinned to TARGET_SHA via
detached HEAD**. We deliberately do NOT `gh pr checkout` — that would
try to claim the branch name locally, which fails if another worktree
(elsewhere on the machine, e.g. another agent session) already has it
checked out. Detached HEAD bypasses branch-name ownership entirely.

```bash
TARGET_SHA=$(gh pr view "$N" --json headRefOid -q .headRefOid)
TARGET_BRANCH=$(gh pr view "$N" --json headRefName -q .headRefName)
PR_FORK_REPO=$(gh pr view "$N" --json headRepository,headRepositoryOwner \
                 -q '.headRepositoryOwner.login + "/" + .headRepository.name')

WORKTREE=/tmp/orch-${REPO_SLUG}-pr${N}
rm -rf "$WORKTREE"   # clean slate; previous worker should have removed it

# Fetch the PR head SHA explicitly (handles fork remotes — `gh` already
# made it reachable; the explicit fetch is a belt-and-suspenders for
# the case where the worker runs in a worktree that hasn't seen the SHA
# yet).
git fetch origin "$TARGET_SHA" 2>/dev/null \
  || git fetch origin "pull/$N/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr-$N-head" 2>/dev/null \
  || true

# Detached HEAD worktree — does NOT claim the branch name. Survives
# concurrent worktrees / omnara sessions / etc.
git worktree add --detach "$WORKTREE" "$TARGET_SHA"
```

The worker Agent operates in `$WORKTREE`. After the worker returns:

```bash
git worktree remove "$WORKTREE" --force
```

(Cleanup happens regardless of worker success/failure — see step 9.)

Spawn the worker via the `Agent` tool:

```python
Agent(
    description=f"PR #{N} fix worker round {round_n}/4",
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt=<<see "Worker prompt" below>>
)
```

#### Worker prompt (template — substitute concrete values)

```
You are the fix worker for the PR review pipeline (Agent B's
sub-agent). Your job for this round only:

1. cwd is `{WORKTREE}`. The repo is in **detached HEAD state pinned
   to TARGET_SHA={TARGET_SHA} (PR head at tick start)**. The branch
   `{TARGET_BRANCH}` is NOT checked out locally — that's intentional
   (avoids collisions with concurrent worktrees / external agents).
   Verify with: `git status` (shows "HEAD detached at <sha>") +
   `git log --oneline -5`.

2. Read these files in this order:
   - `~/.claude/skills/pr-defense-loop/SKILL.md` — the triage discipline
     (a) worth fixing / (b) wrong analysis / (c) not worth fixing.
     Apply this exactly. Don't reinvent it.
   - The PR description: `gh pr view {N} --json body -q .body`
   - The repo's CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md (read from `{WORKTREE}`).
   - Agent A's latest review comment:
     `gh api repos/{OWNER}/{REPO}/issues/{N}/comments | jq '...latest from us'`
   - Local findings cache: `{PR_DIR}/last_findings.jsonl`

3. Triage every finding into (a) / (b) / (c) per the
   pr-defense-loop discipline. Be honest about (b) — false positives
   are real; don't paper over them by shuffling code.

4. Fix the (a) bucket. Constraints:
   - Honor the repo's CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md (package manager, config
     system, storage discipline, language conventions).
   - One regression test per real bug fixed.
   - **Run the test suite locally before pushing. DO NOT push if it
     fails.** How to run:
       * Read the repo's CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / pyproject.toml /
         package.json to find the canonical command (typical:
         `uv run pytest`, `npm test`, `cargo test`, `go test ./...`).
       * Run unit tests for modules you touched. If your diff is broad
         (>3 modules) or you can't tell which tests cover the change,
         run the full unit suite, except groups requiring missing deps
         (e.g. `--ignore=tests/rollout` if the rollout dep group isn't
         installed in the worktree).
       * For E2E / smoke / integration tests that the repo's runbook
         calls out as part of the merge bar: **run them inline, in
         your own context.** Yes, the test output may be heavy — that
         is intentional. You ARE a sub-agent; you do NOT have the
         `Agent` tool, so you cannot delegate tests to a sibling
         sub-agent. Conversely, the orchestrator (Agent B) is
         strictly read-only and cannot run tests for you. Tests are
         your responsibility, top to bottom.
       * Failed-test context staying inside your context window is
         actually useful: if the orchestrator triggers another round
         on the same PR, you'll inherit no memory by default — but
         the failure trace going into your commit message (or your
         `blocked` reason) preserves the signal across rounds.
   - If tests fail and you cannot fix without out-of-scope changes:
     do NOT push. Return with `blocked: "<test name> fails after fix
     attempt; need wider scope: <one-line specifics>"`. Include the
     first ~20 lines of the failure trace in the blocked reason —
     the orchestrator escalates to the user with this verbatim, so
     specificity here saves a round trip.
   - English code/comments. No emojis unless the repo already uses them.

5. Commit and push. ONE commit per round. Format:

   ```
   fix(<scope>): address Agent A round-{round_n} [auto {round_n}/4]

   <one-paragraph framing>

   1. <severity> — <file:line>: <what was wrong, what was fixed>
   2. ...

   Tests: <names of regression tests added>. Suite: <result>.

   Also: <if any (b) false positives — name them, why they're wrong,
   no code change>.

   Co-Authored-By: <model> <noreply@anthropic.com>
   ```

   The `[auto {round_n}/4]` tag is REQUIRED — it's how the daemon
   recognizes its own work and how the cap is auditable.

6. Push your commit back to the PR's branch with **`--force-with-lease`
   anchored to TARGET_SHA**:

   ```bash
   git push origin "HEAD:refs/heads/{TARGET_BRANCH}" \
     --force-with-lease="{TARGET_BRANCH}:{TARGET_SHA}"
   ```

   This says "only accept my push if the remote branch is still at
   TARGET_SHA". If somebody else (the human author, another agent)
   pushed in the meantime, the lease is broken and our push is
   rejected (non-zero exit code).

   If the push fails because of `--force-with-lease`: the branch
   moved. **Do NOT retry within this round.** Return with
   `blocked: "branch moved during round; remote head is now <new-sha>
   (was <TARGET_SHA>). Skipping; next tick will start fresh from new
   head."` so the orchestrator can stamp state correctly and let the
   next tick re-engage.

   For fork PRs (the head repo differs from the base repo, e.g.
   external contributors): the `--force-with-lease` push targets the
   fork's branch via the `gh`-managed remote — `git push origin` may
   not have access. In that case, fall back to:

   ```bash
   gh pr view {N} --json maintainerCanModify -q .maintainerCanModify
   # if true: push works via origin's pull/<N>/head ref
   # if false: cannot push. Return blocked with reason
   #          "external PR; maintainerCanModify=false; cannot push fix"
   ```

7. Return a structured summary as your final message:

   {
     "round": {round_n},
     "actionable_count": <count of (a) findings>,
     "fixed_count": <count actually fixed and committed>,
     "false_positives": [<comment ids confirmed (b)>],
     "not_worth": [<comment ids triaged (c)>],
     "tests_added": [<test names>],
     "head_sha": "<new HEAD after push>",
     "self_confidence": <0.0..1.0 — see calibration below>,
     "blocked": <null OR a string explaining what blocked you>
   }

   "blocked" examples: "tests fail and I can't fix without breaking
   PR scope", "fix requires schema migration I'm not authorized to
   touch", "AGENTS.md forbids modifying this path".

8. If `actionable_count == 0`, do NOT commit. Return the summary
   with `fixed_count: 0` and a high `self_confidence` reflecting "all
   remaining findings are (b) or (c)."

Self-confidence calibration:
- 0.95+ — All findings cleanly addressed; tests pass; (b)/(c) buckets
  well-justified; no surprises in the diff.
- 0.85–0.94 — All findings addressed but one or more required
  judgment calls you're slightly unsure about.
- 0.70–0.84 — Worked but flagged at least one issue you're uneasy
  about; would prefer a human glance.
- < 0.70 — Don't auto-merge regardless of gate. Set `blocked` if
  appropriate.

Anti-patterns:
- DO NOT amend or rebase past commits — one new commit per round.
- DO NOT push if tests fail.
- DO NOT silently address a (b) finding to make the bot happy. Push
  back via the commit message's "Also:" paragraph.
- DO NOT skip the `[auto N/4]` tag — it's load-bearing.
```

### 5. Read the worker's return value

If the worker returned with `blocked: <reason>` → escalate immediately
(jump to step 8 with `gate_reason="worker blocked: <reason>"`).

Otherwise update state:

```bash
echo "$((round_n))"          > "$PR_DIR/last_orch_round"
date -Iseconds                > "$PR_DIR/last_orch_action_at"
echo "$worker_summary"       >> "$PR_DIR/verdict_log.jsonl"
```

If `actionable_count == 0`:

```bash
n=$(cat "$PR_DIR/consecutive_no_actionable" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
echo $((n + 1)) > "$PR_DIR/consecutive_no_actionable"
```

Else reset:

```bash
echo 0 > "$PR_DIR/consecutive_no_actionable"
```

### 6. Decide: continue, verdict, or escalate

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| `consecutive_no_actionable >= 2` | Worker is converged → **enter verdict gate** (step 7) |
| `last_orch_round >= 4` AND worker still found actionable | Hit the cap → **escalate** (step 8) with reason "max_rounds reached" |
| Worker pushed a fix this round | Release lock, re-arm; Agent A will review the new SHA next tick, then come back |
| Worker returned `blocked` | **Escalate** (step 8) with the worker's reason |

### 7. Verdict gate (auto-merge decision only)

> **The verdict gate decides ONE question: do we `gh pr merge` now, or
> not?** It does NOT decide whether to run the worker — that decision
> was made upstream by the opt-in marker. By the time we reach step 7,
> the worker has already run (step 4) and pushed a fix (or returned
> with no actionable findings). This is purely "is auto-merge safe?".

The gate is intentionally small. Only correctness/security signals.
No "this seems too big for me to feel comfortable" heuristics — those
were Era-1 budget proxies (when worker compute was scarce we used
diff size to gate which PRs got fixed); they don't belong in a quality
gate.

```python
ci_green = all(
    check["conclusion"] == "success"
    for check in gh_api(f"repos/{OWNER}/{REPO}/commits/{HEAD_SHA}/check-runs")["check_runs"]
) or (no checks configured for this repo)  # repos w/o CI: gate trivially passes this leg
codex_clean = the most recent codex review on this PR (from Agent A's
              last_findings.jsonl) reports zero [P0] findings
confidence_ok = worker_self_confidence >= 0.85
internal_author = author_association in ("OWNER", "MEMBER", "COLLABORATOR")

gate_pass = ci_green AND codex_clean AND confidence_ok AND internal_author
```

Note `internal_author` is REQUIRED for auto-merge. External
contributor PRs ALWAYS go to the manual-merge path, regardless of
dry-run state.

Three branches:

#### 7a. `gate_pass == True` AND `dry_run` flag file present

Post a "would auto-merge" comment (no actual merge):

```markdown
## PR review pipeline — Agent B verdict @ <HEAD_SHA short>

**Would auto-merge** (dry-run mode active; no action taken).

Gate: PASS
- CI: ✓ all checks green
- codex: ✓ no [P0]
- Worker confidence: ✓ <conf>
- Author: ✓ internal

cc @{user} — when you're ready to flip out of dry-run mode for this
repo, `rm ~/.local/state/claude-pr-pipeline/{REPO_SLUG}/dry_run`.

Worker rounds this snapshot: {last_orch_round}.
```

```bash
echo "$HEAD_SHA" > "$PR_DIR/last_orch_round_sha"
```

#### 7b. `gate_pass == True` AND no `dry_run` flag file

Real merge:

```bash
gh pr merge "$N" --squash --delete-branch=false  # repo-policy dependent
```

Post a confirmation comment after merge succeeds:

```markdown
## PR review pipeline — Agent B verdict @ <HEAD_SHA>

**Auto-merged.** Gate PASS.

- CI: ✓ all checks green
- codex: ✓ no [P0]
- Worker confidence: ✓ <conf>
- Author: ✓ internal

Worker rounds this snapshot: {last_orch_round}.
```

```bash
echo "$HEAD_SHA" > "$PR_DIR/last_orch_round_sha"
```

#### 7c. `gate_pass == False` — fixes are pushed, auto-merge waits

**This is NORMAL, not failure.** The worker did the work it promised.
Auto-merge just needs something we don't have yet (typically CI still
running, or codex still has a [P0], or worker confidence below threshold).

Post a "manual-merge note" comment — neutral, informational, NOT an
escalation:

```markdown
## PR review pipeline — Agent B note @ <HEAD_SHA short>

Worker round {last_orch_round} done. Fix commit `[auto {N}/{max_rounds}]`
pushed. **Auto-merge waiting on:**

{checklist with ✗ for failing items, ✓ for passing}
- CI: {✓ all green / ✗ <which check failed> / ⏳ still running}
- codex [P0]: {✓ none / ✗ N findings still flagged}
- Worker confidence: {✓ <conf>≥0.85 / ✗ <conf><0.85}
- Author internal: {✓ <OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR> / ✗ external — auto-merge disabled for external authors}

If you push another commit to this branch, the loop re-engages on the
new head SHA automatically. If you want to merge by hand, go ahead.
```

```bash
echo "$HEAD_SHA" > "$PR_DIR/last_orch_round_sha"
```

The loop re-engages naturally when head moves. **No `last_escalated_sha`
stamp here** — this isn't escalation; the human's action (push or
merge) is the expected resolution path.

#### 7d. `last_orch_round >= max_rounds` AND worker still finds actionable

Hit the per-snapshot round cap. THIS is escalation (step 8). Stamp
`last_escalated_sha = HEAD_SHA`. Next tick checks that file and
silently skips while head stays at that SHA. New commit → re-engage.

### 8. Escalation

> **Escalation is rare.** It fires ONLY from two paths:
> - Step 7d: hit `max_rounds=4` on the same snapshot with findings still actionable
> - Step 5: worker returned `blocked: <reason>`
>
> Verdict-gate failure (CI red, codex P0, low confidence) is NOT
> escalation — that's step 7c "manual-merge note". The distinction
> matters: 7c says "we did our job, waiting on something natural";
> 8 says "something is structurally wrong, human needs to intervene."

Post a PR comment with `@{user}` mention:

```markdown
## PR review pipeline — Agent B escalation @ <HEAD_SHA short>

@{user} — this snapshot is stuck. Agent B reached its structural limit.

**Reason:** {gate_reason — one of: "max_rounds reached on this SHA",
"worker returned blocked: <verbatim>"}

**Gate snapshot at escalation time:**
- CI: {✓/✗} {detail if failed}
- codex: {✓/✗ N [P0] findings remaining}
- Worker confidence: {<conf> (threshold 0.85)}
- Author: {OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR/CONTRIBUTOR/...}

**Round history:**
{worker summary table from verdict_log.jsonl}

**Outstanding findings (worker triaged but didn't fix):**
{(b) and (c) buckets — comment ids and reasons}

When you've decided, either:
- Merge manually if you accept the risk Agent B flagged.
- Push a new commit — Agent B will automatically re-engage on the new
  head SHA (no manual state-file cleanup needed).
- Close the PR.
```

```bash
echo "$HEAD_SHA" > "$PR_DIR/last_escalated_sha"
```

The `last_escalated_sha` stamp tells Agent B: "we already gave up on
THIS exact SHA". If the head moves (author pushes), the file's value
no longer matches and Agent B re-engages naturally. **Do NOT write
`escalated_at`** — that was the old permanent-freeze marker; it's
deprecated. If you see a stale `escalated_at` file from a pre-2026-
SKILL-revision daemon, ignore it (don't read it, don't write it).

### 9. Cleanup and re-arm

```bash
git worktree remove "$WORKTREE" --force 2>/dev/null || true
flock -u 9 2>/dev/null  # release the lock
exec 9>&-

# Touch repo-level "B just ticked" timestamp. Used by the
# notify_orch fast-handoff check below — this is how we know whether
# A's notify is NEW relative to our last tick.
date -Iseconds > "$STATE_ROOT/last_orch_tick_at"
```

**Re-arm: nothing to do.** Channel 1 (cron 2-min) and Channel 2
(Monitor on notify_orch) from step 1.5 are already in place and will
wake the daemon at the right time. Just exit and let them fire.

If you have NOT yet set up channels 1/2 (e.g., this is the first tick
of a new session): go back and do it now per step 1.5.

The historical Phase 1 ScheduleWakeup cadence table is preserved
below as a fallback for the rare case where neither cron nor Monitor
is available — but in practice the harness rejects ScheduleWakeup
("/loop dynamic gate off"), so this code path is dead. Keep for
documentation only.

<details>
<summary>Phase 1 ScheduleWakeup cadence (deprecated; kept for reference)</summary>

| `notify_orch` mtime > `last_orch_tick_at` mtime | **60** | A just posted a review since our last tick |
| Just spawned a worker that pushed a fix | 270 | Agent A will review the new SHA in its next tick |
| Just escalated | 1800 | Nothing to do until user clears `escalated_at` |

## External contributor PRs

`author_association` in `("CONTRIBUTOR", "FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR", "NONE", "MANNEQUIN")`:

- Check `gh pr view <N> --json maintainerCanModify`.
- If `maintainerCanModify == False`: **don't even spawn the worker.**
  Post an escalation comment immediately: "External PR without
  maintainer-edit permission; cannot auto-fix. cc @{user}".
- If `maintainerCanModify == True`: spawn the worker normally
  (`gh pr checkout` and push will work). But at the verdict step,
  ALWAYS escalate — never auto-merge external contributions
  regardless of dry-run state.

This is a hard rule. Do not allow it to be overridden by a config flag
in the first 6 months of operating this pipeline. External-contributor
PRs are the canonical place where automated merge decisions go wrong;
the cost of an unwanted merge there is bigger than the convenience of
auto-merging.

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't auto-merge external PRs.** See above.
- **Don't run more than one fix worker concurrently per PR.** The
  per-PR `flock` enforces this — don't try to "optimize" by spawning
  parallel workers; they'll race-push and confuse Agent A.
- **Don't skip the dry-run flag check.** The user opted into dry-run
  for a reason. Trust the file's presence; don't second-guess.
- **Don't escalate the same finding twice.** If `escalated_at` is
  already set, you've already pinged the user — sit on it.
- **Don't forget to remove the temp worktree.** A failed worker that
  doesn't clean up will accumulate `/tmp/orch-*` directories.
  `git worktree remove --force` in a `trap` is the disciplined way.
- **Don't squash worker commits across rounds.** Each round commit is
  an audit artifact. The user will squash on real merge if they want.
- **Don't run the worker in the daemon's tmux session's working
  directory.** Always use `git worktree add` to a temp path. Otherwise
  `gh pr checkout` switches the daemon's branch and breaks state.

- **Don't proactively `rm -rf` "stale" or "old" files. Ever.**
  Observed habit: the daemon notices old files in `/tmp/orch-*-prN/`
  from a closed PR, or stale entries under `~/.local/state/...`, and
  tries to "tidy up" with `rm -rf`. **DON'T.** An external janitor
  process handles GC — that's not your job. The ONLY `rm -rf` /
  `git worktree remove` you do per tick is the explicit one in step
  9 against your OWN current-round worktree (`$WORKTREE` =
  `/tmp/orch-<slug>-pr<N>` for the PR you JUST processed).

  Specifically forbidden, even when they look "obviously stale":
    - Other PRs' worker worktrees (`/tmp/orch-*-pr<other-N>`)
    - State dirs under `~/.local/state/claude-pr-pipeline/...`
    - `~/.claude/` (or any sibling Claude config dir the user maintains)
    - Anything that you didn't create within THIS tick

  If you genuinely think something old needs cleaning, surface it in
  the verdict_log entry as a `housekeeping_note` field and let the
  user decide. The `protect-state-from-rm.sh` hook will block most
  such attempts at the system level, but treat that as a SAFETY NET,
  not a permission to try.

## First-run setup checklist

1. Verify `pr-review-tick` is also running for the same repo (or has
   been run at least once) — Agent B without Agent A has nothing to do.
2. Verify `git worktree` is available.
3. Verify the user has merge permissions on the repo (or has set up
   admin override) — `gh pr merge --dry-run` doesn't exist; the only
   way to test is to actually attempt a merge, which is unsafe to do
   in setup. Trust the user's judgment.
4. Confirm `~/.local/state/claude-pr-pipeline/<repo>/dry_run` exists
   (create it if not). New repos should always start in dry-run.
5. Run one tick manually (don't `/loop` yet) on a real PR to verify
   the worker spawn + worktree management + verdict comment flow.
   Inspect every artifact.
6. Once the manual tick works, switch to `/loop /pr-orch-tick`.

## Termination

Same as Agent A — long-running, kill the tmux session to stop:

```bash
tmux kill-session -t <repo>-orchestrator
```

If the daemon hits a permanent error, surface it and don't re-arm.
