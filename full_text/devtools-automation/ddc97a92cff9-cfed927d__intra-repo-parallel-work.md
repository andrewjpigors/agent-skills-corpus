description: Coordinate multiple workers (agents or people) running in parallel on different items INSIDE one FS-GG repo. Use when you want to fan work out across concurrent workers without them grabbing the same item, stomping a shared working tree, or colliding on the same files. Gives each worker an id, locks items with a comment-order CAS (the assignee CANNOT lock, because N agents share one GitHub account), isolates work in per-item git worktrees, schedules disjoint `Paths:` touch-sets, and gives workers a channel to talk when their work overlaps. Canonical protocol lives in FS-GG/.github. See ADR-0021 and ADR-0027.

# Intra-repo parallel work (FS-GG)

The [cross-repo-coordination](../cross-repo-coordination/SKILL.md) skill coordinates work
*between* the four product repos. This skill is its **inner-repo sibling**: running several
workers **in parallel on different items inside one repo**. It does **not** replace that
fabric — it reuses the Coordination board, the `Blocked by` sequencing, the earned
done-stamp, and the `fsgg-coord` client verbatim. Canonical protocol:
`FS-GG/.github` → `docs/coordination/parallel-work.md`; decisions: `docs/adr/0021-*`
(worktrees, touch-sets) and `docs/adr/0027-*` (worker identity, the lock, the channel).

## Read this first: the assignee cannot lock anything

N agents in a fan-out authenticate as the **same GitHub account**. `@me` is therefore one
principal for all of them, and anything keyed on the account cannot tell two workers apart.
ADR-0021 keyed its claim lock on the issue assignee; under exactly the conditions the lock
existed for, a second worker's claim on a held item **succeeded**, and both worked it.

So: **every worker has an id**, and the lock, the channel, and attribution all key on it.

```sh
scripts/fsgg-coord whoami          # your id, and which rule produced it
```

Resolution order: `--worker <id>` → `$FSGG_WORKER` → **the git worktree's name** (the normal
case: one worktree per item, so the worktree *is* an identity) → the agent harness's
**session id** → a generated name persisted per checkout.

The last two rules **warn**, because each can hand one id to several workers. A shared checkout
gives them one id; and a session id is unique per *session*, not per *worker* — on Claude Code
every subagent of a session shares one `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, so a fan-out collapses onto a
single id, which is the same-account bug one level down. (On OpenCode subagents are child
sessions with their own ids, so there it is per-worker and does not warn.) **Fan out with
worktrees, or set `FSGG_WORKER` per worker.** See
`docs/coordination/agent-session-identifiers.md` in FS-GG/.github for the harness survey.

When you set it, **mint it with the tool — never invent it, and never copy one from a document**:

```sh
eval "$(scripts/fsgg-coord whoami --mint)"
```

This is the **one** mint idiom across the tool, the protocol doc, and both skill roots — the line
`whoami`'s own warning prints (#551).

A hand-picked id is the same-account bug a *third* level down. Agents asked to name themselves
converge — this board has carried **four `finch-*` workers at once**, every one of them copied from
the worked example that used to sit on this line, while the ids `whoami` *mints* spread cleanly
across the word list. Two workers holding one id defeats every operation that keys on it: `release`
drops the other's claim mid-flight, `heartbeat` renews a marker that is not yours, `say`/`inbox`
cross-deliver, and `claim`'s CAS cannot tell its own marker from its twin's. Re-rolling the suffix
is not enough — the attractor is the **word**, and any literal printed here becomes one (#419).
Which is why there is none: not on this line, not in the loop below, not in the protocol doc.

Whatever named you, the claim marker records `harness=<name> session=<id>` as provenance, so
"which agent transcript took this lock?" is a lookup rather than mtime forensics.

## What this adds (and only this)

| Free across repos | Not free inside one repo | This skill's answer |
|---|---|---|
| A repo has **one owner** | N workers can grab the **same item** | **Claim** = an `fsgg:claim` marker comment, won by **lowest live comment id** (a server-side total order → exactly one winner) |
| Separate repos = separate **checkouts** | Workers **stomp one working tree** | **Isolate** = one branch + one **git worktree** per item |
| Shared surface is a versioned **contract** (registry) | Shared surface is **files** | **Touch-set** = a declared `Paths:` line, scheduled by `batch` |
| A repo owner is a **person you can ask** | Workers cannot see or talk to each other | **`who`** (what is running) + **`say`/`inbox`** (a channel) |

Everything else is inherited: the board is still the source of *order*, the registry of
*contracts*, ADRs of *decisions*; `fsgg-coord done <issue> --flip` still earns the done-stamp
and rolls epics up.

## When to use this skill

1. You want to **fan out** several agents/people onto different items in one repo at once.
2. You need to know whether **two items can run in parallel** (or must be sequenced).
3. You're about to start an item and must **claim it** so no one else picks it up.
4. Your work has started to **overlap someone else's** and you need to coordinate.

If the work is cross-repo (needs a change/release from *another* FS-GG repo), use
[cross-repo-coordination](../cross-repo-coordination/SKILL.md) instead.

## The loop

**In a receiver, nothing.** `scripts/fsgg-coord` is the ADR-0034 §4.4 shim now (ADR-0040 Phase D): it
resolves the compiled `fsgg-coord-engine` and `exec`s it — there is no bash implementation left, and no
shadow. The engine is already declared in `.config/dotnet-tools.json`, and the shim **restores it for you**
the first time it needs it. A manifest is a *declaration*, not an *installation*; the kit used to ask the
worker to run the restore, and asking is not a mechanism (measured hit rate: zero), so the shim does it
(#655).

**Outside a receiver:** install it globally, and keep it current —

```sh
dotnet tool install -g FS.GG.Coord.Cli         # provides `fsgg-coord-engine`
dotnet tool update  -g FS.GG.Coord.Cli         # a global tool does NOT self-update
```

The engine **is** the scheduler now, so a stale one mis-schedules — there is no bash answer behind it any
more: engines before `0.1.1` mis-parse every dotfile path and will call a HELD item startable (#649). If
the shim resolves no engine it fails loudly with what to do — never a silent no-op (#266).

```sh
eval "$(scripts/fsgg-coord whoami --mint)"     # MINT one; never invent or copy one (#419, #551)
scripts/fsgg-coord take --repo <this-repo>     # pick + claim the next SCHEDULABLE item, retrying a lost race
git fetch origin                               # NOTHING else does — the base is otherwise the PAST (#622)
git worktree add ../<repo>-<n> -b item/<n>-<slug> origin/main   # name the base (#319)
# ...implement, commit with the printed FSGG-Worker trailer, PR into main...
scripts/fsgg-coord done <issue> --flip         # earn the stamp
```

`take` is the entry point. It asks `batch` what is schedulable *right now* (disjoint from
everything in flight), claims it, and — on a lost race — **re-schedules** rather than going
home. Use `claim <issue>` only when you must have a *specific* item.

## 1. Declare the touch-set (on every parallelizable item)

Each item's issue body carries a **`Paths:`** line naming the file subtrees it will touch —
comma- or space-separated **exact paths and directory prefixes**. This is the intra-repo analogue
of a contract: it makes the shared surface explicit and checkable *before* work starts.

```
Paths: src/Scene/**, tests/Scene/**, Directory.Packages.props
```

**An item with no touch-set says `Paths: none`** (`.github#496`) — an epic, a decision item, an
investigation whose scope *is* the question. It stays unschedulable either way; the sentinel makes
the absence **deliberate and machine-readable**. `fsgg-coord lint` errors (`NO-TOUCH-SET`) on a
`Ready`/`Backlog` item declaring neither, because the alternative is what actually happened: an epic
and an omission rendered identically, nine items of real work went invisible to every worker who
asked for work, and the one surface whose job is board health reported `0 error(s)` over a dead queue.

**Not globs.** See [The rules](#the-rules) below — that section is GENERATED from the engine that
enforces it, so it cannot drift from what `claim`, `widen`, `batch`, `overlap` and `verify-paths`
actually do. Want every lockfile? List them.

**Editing a kit source obliges `registry/repos.lock` — and you must NOT reserve it** (`.github#469`,
`#527`, ADR-0019). The coordination kit is **content-addressed**: `registry/repos.lock` pins a `sha256`
of every kit source — `scripts/fsgg-coord` and each `.claude/skills/<kit>/` directory. Any edit to one
invalidates its digest, and `repos-registry-selftest` reds `main` until it is regenerated:

```sh
scripts/repos.sh relock          # regenerates registry/repos.lock
```

**The touch-set for a kit change is the kit source ONLY.** `registry/repos.lock` is a **generated,
CI-gated artifact**, so `#309`'s rule applies to it: *do not reserve a generated artifact*. Regenerate
it and commit it — `verify-paths` asks `repos.sh relock --list` what it emits and reports the lock under
`regenerated (expected):`, so there is nothing to explain in the PR body (ADR-0044, `#498`). A collision
in it is a **rebase, not a decision**.

`widen` and `verify-paths` now **look**: they recompute each kit source's digest and compare it against
`registry/repos.lock`, so the warning fires exactly when the lock is genuinely stale and goes quiet
exactly when you have relocked. It used to ask whether you had *declared* a file, and call the
obligation met if you had — which was silent in precisely the case where it was wrong (`#563`).
Advisory, because `repos-registry-selftest` is the authority.

**A declaration is a line you wrote as one** (`.github#277`). A `Paths:` line inside a fenced
(``` or `~~~`) or indented code block is a **quotation**, not a declaration — quote freely in
reproductions and suggested `widen` commands. So an issue whose only `Paths:` line is fenced declares
**nothing** and is refused as undeclared, rather than silently reserving the files it quoted. Indent a
real declaration by **at most 3 spaces, and never a tab** — markdown reads 4 spaces (or a tab) as a
code block, and so does the reader.

Quote in a **fence**, not bare. A bare `Paths:` line at column 0 *is* a declaration, and if you leave
two of them the reader **unions** both — it over-reserves rather than guess which one you meant, so
you get a loud false `OVERLAP` instead of a silent collision. `widen` collapses them back to one.

**Do not reserve generated artifacts** (`.github#309`). A `Paths:` token names a file two workers might
*author* into conflict. A file produced by a checked-in generator and guarded by a **regeneration gate**
— a CI check that re-runs the generator and fails on any diff — is neither authored nor semantically
conflicting: **a collision in it is a rebase, not a decision.** Declaring it reserves a file nobody owns,
and serialises every item that regenerates it. `FS.GG.Game` is the instance: one generated
`readiness/surface-baselines/<pkg>.txt` per package, and every `[core]` item appends a line to it — so
declared honestly, every `[core]` item overlapped every other and the whole `P6 Game` phase collapsed to
**one worker**, in the phase the protocol exists to fan out.

Two conditions, and the second is not optional:

1. **Nobody authors it.** Ask whether a human makes a *merge decision* in the file. If two workers' edits
   can only be reconciled by re-running a script, neither has an intent to preserve. The test is
   **authorship, not `.gitignore`** — a generated file that is committed and reviewed is still not
   authored.
2. **A regeneration gate guards it.** Excluding the file moves the guarantee from the *scheduler* to
   *CI*, so CI must actually have it. **If nothing fails on a stale copy, do not exclude it** — you would
   be trading a loud false `OVERLAP` for a silent unguarded staleness, which is strictly worse. Add the
   gate first, or keep declaring the file.

**Beware the subtree.** `overlap` matches directory prefixes, so declaring the artifact's *parent*
reserves it exactly as effectively as naming it. Declare your sources, not the directory the generated
file happens to sit in — `src/Core/**, readiness/**` locks the baseline against the whole board just as
`readiness/surface-baselines/**` does, while `src/Core/Pathfinding.fs, tests/Core/PathfindingTests.fs`
locks nothing it does not own.

**Declare against what the generator emits, not against the issue's prose.** `FS.GG.Game#31`'s acceptance
said "surface baseline"; it adds a *function* to an existing module, and the generator emits one exported
**type** per line — so it never touched the baseline at all. A `Paths:` line asserted from an issue body
rather than from the generator's output is how a *false global lock* gets created.

**Then expect the drift, and name it.** Excluding an artifact you go on to regenerate is exactly what
`verify-paths` reports as touch-set drift, and it cannot today tell that from a real undeclared edit
(`.github#498`). **Say which one it is in the PR** — an advisory that fires on correct behaviour is one
workers learn to skip past.

Declare narrowly and honestly. An item with no `Paths:` is **unschedulable** — `batch` will
report it and refuse to hand it out.

## 2. Let the scheduler decide what can run at once

Do **not** run `overlap` over every candidate pair by hand. Ask:

```sh
scripts/fsgg-coord batch --repo <r> -n 4    # a maximal disjoint set, at most 4
scripts/fsgg-coord overlap <a> --active     # one candidate vs every live claim
scripts/fsgg-coord overlap <a> <b>          # the pairwise check (0=disjoint, 1=overlap, 2=undeclared)
```

`batch` picks items disjoint **from each other and from every claimed item**, and it reads the
**claim marker, not the board column** (the `Status` flip is best-effort and can lag). A claimed
item's touch-set is **reserved**, not merely skipped.

- **DISJOINT** → own worktree each, run concurrently.
- **OVERLAP** → **sequence** with `Blocked by`, or **talk** (§4) and split the touch-set.
  `Blocked by` takes **issue refs only** — `fsgg-coord set-field <later> 'Blocked by' '<earlier>'`.
  Put "overlaps X on Program.fs, sequence" in an issue comment; the field is what
  `fsgg-coord next` reads to refuse to hand out the later item.

## 3. Claim, isolate, heartbeat

```sh
scripts/fsgg-coord claim <issue>            # marker + assignee + Status=In progress; prints the worktree
scripts/fsgg-coord claim <issue> --force    # steal an item another worker holds
scripts/fsgg-coord heartbeat <issue>        # renew the lease on a long-running claim
scripts/fsgg-coord release <issue>          # drop the lease; Status RESTORED to what the claim overwrote
scripts/fsgg-coord release <issue> --status Blocked   # ...drop it, but say where it lands
scripts/fsgg-coord child <parent> <issue>   # link <issue> as a sub-issue — see §5
```

`release` drops the **lease**, which is not the same claim as *"this item is startable"*. It undoes
the `In progress` that `claim` set, and only that — but note *how*, because the two cases are
different mechanisms (#481):

- **Restored.** `claim` **overwrites** the column, so it *records* what it overwrote. `release` puts
  that back: a `Backlog` item returns to `Backlog`. It is not preserved — it is remembered. `Ready`
  is only the fallback for a claim that recorded nothing (a pre-#481 marker, or a column that could
  not be read). Guessing `Ready` was the bug: since #440 made `claim` reachable from `Backlog`,
  every undo path quietly **promoted** triaged work into the queue humans read as ready.
- **Kept.** A `Status` you set *deliberately during* the lease — `Blocked`, `Done` — is left alone
  (#331). A column it cannot read is left alone too, rather than guessed.

`reap` collects an expired lease under the same rule, so a claim that dies on a `Blocked` item does
not resurrect it as `Ready`. So handing back an item you cannot finish keeps its column honest:

```sh
scripts/fsgg-coord set-field <issue> 'Blocked by' 'FS-GG/<repo>#<n>'
scripts/fsgg-coord release   <issue> --status Blocked
```

The **marker is the lock**. The assignee is set only so a human sees it on the board.
On a simultaneous claim there is exactly **one winner** (lowest live marker id); a loser deletes
its own marker and tells you to pick another item.

**Leases.** Past `FSGG_CLAIM_LEASE_MIN` (default 120m) without a heartbeat, a claim is *stale*: the
next claimant collects it (and tells you), and `reap` releases it.

**An expired lease cannot be renewed.** `heartbeat` renews only the current holder. If yours lapsed it
**refuses and tells you to stop working the item**, naming whoever holds it now. Re-take it with
`claim`, or walk away — renewing a dead marker would put two workers on one item.

```sh
scripts/fsgg-coord reap --repo <r>            # dry run: whose claims outlived their lease?
scripts/fsgg-coord reap --repo <r> --apply    # release them, and tell the reaped worker
scripts/fsgg-coord adopt <issue>              # a DEAD claim whose PR is GREEN: LAND it, don't bin it
```

**An orphan is not garbage** ([#697](https://github.com/FS-GG/.github/issues/697)). `reap` refuses a
stale claim whose `item/<n>-*` PR is open — the lease lapsed, the *work* did not (#581) — but its only
remedy used to be *"close it, then reap"*, and pointed at a green, mergeable PR that sentence destroys
the best work on the board. There are **three** states, and the tools now tell them apart by reading
what the PR **says**, not merely that it exists:

| the PR on a stale claim | what to do |
|---|---|
| open, still being worked | leave it (#581) |
| open, abandoned mid-flight | close it, then `reap` |
| **open, green and mergeable** | **`adopt` it — this work is FINISHED** |

The third row is the **success path** of a worker whose harness died between "the PR is green" and
"merge" — a window that is minutes long on every item. `adopt` verifies the PR is green **and**
mergeable, transfers the claim to you, and hands you the merge; the original commits keep their author,
and you are the **lander**. It refuses a live claim (that is a steal), an item with no PR (nothing to
land), and any PR that is not green and mergeable (that is *authoring*, not landing).

Work on `item/<n>-<slug>` in its **own git worktree**. Agents: prefer the harness's built-in
worktree isolation (`isolation: "worktree"`) — the same discipline, managed for you. Commit with the
trailer `claim` prints (`FSGG-Worker: <id>`) so attribution survives into history.

**Always name the base ref** — `git worktree add … -b item/<n>-<slug> origin/main`. With no
commit-ish, `-b` branches from the *shared checkout's* `HEAD`, and this protocol's whole premise is
that N workers pass through that checkout: its `HEAD` is routinely another worker's unmerged branch,
not `main`. Omit the base and the item's PR silently carries that branch's commits too. Nothing warns
you: `verify-paths` reports the resulting drift only as an advisory, and only for as long as that
sibling branch stays unmerged (.github#319).

**And `git fetch origin` FIRST — naming the base is only half of it.** `git worktree add` does not
fetch; it resolves `origin/main` against the *local* remote-tracking ref, which advances only when
something in this checkout fetches. The same premise that makes the base ref necessary makes the fetch
necessary, and pointing the other way: N workers are merging into `main`, so **the better this protocol
is working, the staler your `origin/main` is when you start.** A stale base is worse than it sounds —
it does not merely hide a merged fix, it manufactures fresh evidence for the bug, because the tree you
build and test is internally consistent and simply old (.github#622).

Keep `main` green. **Disjoint** items merge in any order; **overlapping** items (which you
sequenced) merge in `Blocked by` order and rebase.

## 4. See what is running; talk when work touches

```sh
scripts/fsgg-coord who --repo <r>           # worker, item, age, lease, paths, title
scripts/fsgg-coord who --repo <r> --local   # ...joined to the local git worktrees
```

Never go spelunking through worktrees to work out what is running. `who` flags:

- **`STALE`** — the holder stopped heartbeating; probably dead. `reap` it.
- **`STALE (#<pr> OPEN — GREEN: LAND IT)`** — the claim is dead but the work is **finished**. Do NOT
  reap it and do NOT close the PR: `adopt` it (#697).
- **`UNCLAIMED`** — `In progress` with **no marker**: someone is working outside the protocol and
  nothing records who. Detection, not prevention — but loud instead of invisible.

When your work touches someone else's:

```sh
scripts/fsgg-coord say <issue> --to <worker> 'I own src/Audio until this lands.'
scripts/fsgg-coord inbox --repo <r>          # what is new for me, across every live claim
```

`widen` **re-declares** a touch-set mid-flight. It sets `Paths:` to exactly what you pass — it does
not union with what was there — then re-checks the result against every live claim **and notifies
whoever it now collides with**:

```sh
scripts/fsgg-coord widen <issue> --paths "src/Scene/**, src/Audio/**"   # non-zero on a collision
```

Stop editing the shared paths until the collision is resolved.

**So it narrows, too — and narrowing is the direction nobody ever uses.** Pass a smaller set and the
reservation genuinely shrinks. A narrowing can never be refused for collision, because a subset
collides with nothing its superset did not; the capability is already there and it is safe. The name
says "widen" and only the *growth* direction is ever taught, so an over-reservation is **never handed
back** — it holds for the full lease, against files nobody is touching, and the workers it locks out
see only a dead queue ([#601](https://github.com/FS-GG/.github/issues/601)).

**When you learn your declaration over-reserves, re-declare it smaller — at once, not at merge.**
[pnext-item §3](../pnext-item/SKILL.md) names the two triggers that actually fire.

## 5. Finish — the earned done-stamp (unchanged)

```sh
scripts/fsgg-coord done <issue> --flip     # green FSGG-DONE only after PR merged AND Status=Done
```

Same stamp and epic roll-up as cross-repo. Check your PR stayed inside its declaration:

### Never write a closing keyword next to an issue you do not mean to close

GitHub scans the PR body for `close|closes|closed|fix|fixes|fixed|resolve|resolves|resolved` followed
by an issue ref, and links the two. **It does not parse the sentence.** A body that said, in as many
words, `It does not close #422` **closed #422** on merge — the string contains `close #422`, and the
negation is invisible to the parser. The board then stamped the item **Done**, so an open, unfinished,
explicitly-not-done item was closed and stamped with its acceptance criteria unmet
([#643](https://github.com/FS-GG/.github/issues/643)).

`done --flip` cannot save you here: it refuses to stamp work that is not *merged*, and this work
**was** merged — it just did not *finish the item*.

It needs no negation, either — only adjacency. Narrative past tense (`On merge, GitHub closed #422`),
a quoted example, a deferral (`a follow-up will resolve #N`): none carries the word "not", and every
one closes an issue. So the rule is:

> **Say what you close, on a line that says nothing else. Everywhere else in the body, GitHub must
> not be able to bind a keyword to a number.**

```
Closes #643.                  ← a declaration: the whole line, nothing else on it
Closes #1, closes #2.         ← REPEAT the keyword. `Closes #1, #2` closes only #1; the bare
                                `#2` binds to nothing and is silently dropped.
```

Everywhere else, deny the binding: **reword the verb** (`does NOT complete`, `addresses`,
`supersedes`), **drop the verb** (`Refs #422.`), or **break the adjacency** (quote the number without
its `#`).

**Writing it as code does NOT work, and this line used to say it did**
([#683](https://github.com/FS-GG/.github/issues/683)). Two parsers read a PR and they disagree about
code. The **markdown** parser builds the PR's `closingIssuesReferences` link and skips code — but what
**closes** the issue on a squash merge is the **commit message**, and that is **plain text**, in which
backticks and fences are ordinary characters. PR
[#681](https://github.com/FS-GG/.github/pull/681) — the PR that shipped the gate against this bug —
took its own advice, wrote its examples in backticks, and **re-closed #422**. The docs may quote the
bug in code because a file in the tree is never parsed for keywords; **a PR body may not.**

The `closing-keywords` gate fails the PR on every undeclared closing reference, and it now scans the
**raw** body — code included — because that is the parse that closes the issue.

### If you filed an issue, LINK it — a mention is not a link

`done --flip` rolls an epic up from its **native sub-issue graph**. A `(j) child of #266` title, a
`Child of #266` comment, a line in the epic's body — each *looks* like a link, and none of them is
one. File a child of an epic without linking it and the roll-up cannot see it, so the epic can be
stamped `Done` over your still-open issue. That happened: an epic completed thirty minutes after an
open child of it was filed (#325).

```sh
scripts/fsgg-coord child <parent> <new>    # the ONLY thing that creates the edge rollup reads
```

Run it the moment you file, not at close-out — the whole failure is a worker who moved on. `child`
is idempotent, so re-running it is free. It also puts the REST API's two traps in one place: the
endpoint keys on the child's **id**, not its number, and `gh api -f sub_issue_id=…` sends that id as
a string and gets a 422 — it needs `-F`.

`done --flip` now **refuses to roll up** an epic whose body declares a child that is not linked, and
names it; `fsgg-coord lint` reports the same as `EPIC-UNLINKED-CHILD`. Both read the epic's body
task-list (`- [ ]` / `- [x]` lines naming an issue) as its second, human-legible record of what its
children are, and hold the two records to agreement.

So write the body's task-list the way the matcher reads it, or it counts a child you did not mean.
Only a `- [ ]` / `- [x]` line (also `*`/`+` bullets, `[X]`) indented **at most three spaces**
declares a child, and only its **first** issue ref does:

- **The first ref wins**, positionally in the raw line — a `#n` in a code span or a link's text
  still counts. Put the child ref first and let an aside (`(cf. #100)`, `ties to #163`) trail, or
  the aside becomes the declared child.
- **A bare `#n` resolves against the epic's own repo.** `SDD#109` has no slash, so it is read as
  `.github#109`. Write cross-repo children fully qualified: `FS-GG/FS.GG.SDD#109`.
- **A PR is not a child** — the sub-issue graph holds issues, never PRs. Cite a line a PR delivered
  as a **bare** `/pull/` URL (`https://github.com/FS-GG/.github/pull/239`), which carries no `#n`
  and so declares nothing. `(PR #239)` or `[PR #239](…)` reads as an ordinary `#n`; since #346 the
  gate re-resolves it and drops the ones GitHub confirms are PRs, so a genuine same-repo PR ref no
  longer lingers — it survives only if the number is an *issue* or will not resolve (kept
  fail-closed, #266). The `/pull/` URL stays cleanest: it declares nothing and needs no REST probe.

Canonical, with the live incidents: `docs/coordination/parallel-work.md` §"What the body counts as a declaration".

```sh
scripts/fsgg-coord verify-paths --pr <n>   # files changed outside the issue's `Paths:`
```

The touch-set is a **declaration, not an enforced boundary** — CI reports drift, it does not block.

## The rules

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: fsgg-protocol -->
<!--
  DO NOT EDIT THIS REGION. It is emitted from src/FS.GG.Coord.Core/Protocol.fs by
  scripts/generate-projections, and `projections` in CI fails on any diff.

  This region exists because a rule stated in six documents is a rule that will disagree with
  itself — #485 (startability computed in five places, agreeing in none) and the #502/#531/#551
  family. Edit Protocol.fs and regenerate; a collision here is a rebase, not a decision (#309).
-->

### The rules the scheduler actually enforces

*Generated from the typed core. The engine that decides your item is the engine that wrote this.*

#### `Paths:` is a declaration, and a fenced one is a QUOTATION

Declare the touch-set as a `Paths:` line at up to three leading spaces. A `Paths:` line INSIDE a fenced code block is a quotation of the grammar, not a use of it — the protocol docs quote it constantly. `Paths: none` is a SENTINEL meaning "this item deliberately has no touch-set", and it is not the same fact as having forgotten one.

> **Why:** #277 (a fenced line read as a declaration would let a doc reserve files) and #496 (an epic and a forgotten touch-set rendered identically, so no gate could be written at all — nine items of real work went invisible, and the surface whose job is board health reported `0 error(s)` over a dead queue).

#### The touch-set grammar — it is NOT a glob language

supported: an exact path ('src/Foo.fs'), or a directory prefix ('src/Foo', 'src/Foo/*', 'src/Foo/**'). There is no glob matcher: a leading '**/' or an interior '*' matches nothing — spell the paths out.

> **Why:** #273. Four hand-copied forms of the unmatchable-token predicate existed across two engines. A token that matches no file conflicts with nothing — so an item declaring only such tokens reserves NOTHING, clears every overlap check, and the lock succeeds under exactly the conditions it exists to prevent.

#### Blockers are checked BEFORE the touch-set

The scheduler asks, in order: is the issue closed? is its Status one we hand out? is it BLOCKED? is its touch-set usable? is it HELD? does it overlap work in flight? The first answer that is not "no" is the verdict, and it is the one sentence the worker reads.

> **Why:** ADR-0038. A blocked item cannot be started whatever its touch-set says, so reporting "no `Paths:` declared" sends a worker to fix something that leaves them exactly where they were. And blockers are FREE — they are board facts already in the scan — where a touch-set costs a body READ per item, on the budget that dies first (#418). That is why bash never fetched a blocked item's body, and how an unreadable one could silently cease to exist.

#### A MERGED blocker is RESOLVED; an unreadable one BLOCKS

`Blocked by` clears on CLOSED **or MERGED**. It does not clear on OPEN, on a blocker whose state could not be read (unverifiable), or on prose that is not an issue ref at all (unparseable) — all three BLOCK.

> **Why:** #476: `Blocked by` may name a PULL REQUEST, whose state is OPEN | CLOSED | MERGED. A rule clearing only on CLOSED unblocks when the blocking work is ABANDONED and blocks forever once it is FINISHED — the gate opened precisely when the work was thrown away and shut precisely when it was done. And #266/#421: "I could not look" is not "I looked and it is fine"; prose in a dependency field is not permission.

#### The claim lock is a comment-order CAS, and the ASSIGNEE cannot hold it

A claim is an `fsgg:claim` marker COMMENT, and the lowest live marker id wins. GitHub issues comment ids from one server-side sequence, so "lowest live marker" is a total order every racer observes identically. The GitHub ASSIGNEE cannot be the lock, because N agents share one account. That total order is over MARKERS, and it separates WORKERS only while their ids are DISTINCT: an id two workers share is an id this lock cannot separate, and `release`, `heartbeat`, `say` and `inbox` then act on one another's claims. So a worker id is MINTED, never chosen — a worker asked to pick one is not a random source.

> **Why:** ADR-0027, and #419 for the distinctness half: agents asked to invent an id converge on the same corner of the name space, and this board carried FOUR `finch-*` workers at once — every one of them lifted from the single example id that then sat in the recipe. The attractor is the WORD, not the suffix, which is why the remedy is a mint rather than a reminder to be careful, and why #532/#551/#570 had to remove the pasteable id from the docs twice by hand before a gate asserted it. The lock lives on REST, and the invariant it serves — a lock may never live on the budget that dies first — is unamended. What inverted is WHICH budget that is, so this rule no longer asserts a standing answer. #418 measured GraphQL dying first (five workers looping `take` drained 5,000 pt/hr in ~15 minutes), and REST was chosen as the survivor. #895 measured the reverse, twice on 2026-07-16: REST core hit 0/5,000 and took `claim`/`take`/`who` down with it, while GraphQL stayed healthy through both — 3,639/5,000 at the first of them. This rule used to state "GraphQL is the first budget to die" as standing fact, and that premise is what kept regenerating the doctrine that caused the inversion — a recipe steering every worker's reads onto REST to save GraphQL points, on one shared account, spending the lock's own budget to save 7 points of 5,000. #895 decided (2026-07-17) that the lock STAYS and the DOCTRINE moves (#968): REST is metered per request and cannot be batched, so under fan-out it is structurally the scarcer budget with no lever to pull, where GraphQL batches 100 nodes to a query. Discretionary reads belong on GraphQL; REST carries the lock, which has no alternative.

#### The lease is a WINDOW, and an unknown age says so

A claim's lease is 120 minutes by default (`FSGG_CLAIM_LEASE_MIN`), and `heartbeat` renews it only while it is LIVE. Past it the claim is REAPABLE — not free: only `reap` may break a lock, and an item's touch-set stays reserved until it does. An EXPIRED lease cannot be renewed in place; the holder must re-claim. Evidence that the work is alive — an open `item/<n>-*` PR — withholds the item from `take` and REFUSES a `reap`, but it does not revive the lease. A claim whose age cannot be read reports `lease unknown`, never a window.

> **Why:** #428 ("nothing schedulable" and "queued behind a claim held by <w>, lease frees in ~96m" are the same fact and two completely different operator instructions — the first reads as an empty queue and sends a worker home) and #440/#488 (inventing "frees in ~120m" from a missing timestamp is a confident-but-unfounded sentence, which is the class both were closed for). And the lease is a TIMER, which is why it never decides alone: it cannot see a REST outage, and `heartbeat` is REST, so an outage on the lock's budget spends a lease nobody can renew and silently reads as abandonment (#976, ratifying that the fleet stops there rather than making the clock outage-aware). What answers instead is evidence — an open `item/<n>-*` PR (#581), or a liveness probe that failed and therefore fails closed (#266). Expiry is EVIDENCE of abandonment, never proof.

#### A read that did not happen may never render as a confident answer

An error, an empty result, and a legitimate "no" are three different facts. A failed board scan is not an empty board; a failed marker read is not an unheld item; an unread issue body is not an undeclared touch-set. Every one of them fails CLOSED and says which it was.

> **Why:** Epic #266, which has 51 children. #461: a failed claim scan read as "nothing is claimed", so `take` handed a held item to a second worker. #344: a rate-limited scan exited 0 with no verdict, and a worker read "nothing to do" off a board it never managed to read.

### What the scheduler can tell you, and nothing else

One total function returns one of these. There is no other answer, and there is no silent no —
an unreachable answer is not a negative one.

- **`startable`** — Nothing holds it. It can be claimed now.
- **`issue-closed`** — The issue is CLOSED while the board still shows it open. The issue's state is the WORK; the board column is a PROJECTION of it. When they disagree, the issue wins — run /check-board.
- **`wrong-status`** — Its board Status is not one a scheduler hands out (or it has none at all, which makes it invisible to every scheduler and is a bug, not a decision).
- **`blocked-by`** — A `Blocked by` entry is unresolved. CLOSED and MERGED resolve; OPEN, unverifiable and unparseable all BLOCK.
- **`awaiting-human`** — `Blocked on: human/...` — a HUMAN must act first, whatever the `Paths:` line records, so an agent cannot make the call the item exists to escalate (#918). `human/decision` is unschedulable until a human CHOOSES; `human/action` becomes startable the moment a human action (e.g. a scope grant) lands, but not before. Which one rides on the verdict's `humanBlock` detail.
- **`no-touch-set`** — No `Paths:` line at all — an OMISSION. The item is real work and it is invisible to every worker who asks for work. Declare one, or `Paths: none` if it truly has no touch-set.
- **`deliberately-no-touch-set`** — `Paths: none` — a decision somebody made. An epic, a decision item, an investigation whose scope IS the question. Unschedulable BY DESIGN, and correct.
- **`unusable-touch-set`** — The declaration contains token(s) that can match no file, so they reserve NOTHING — and files nobody reserved are invisible to every other worker's overlap check.
- **`held-by`** — A live claim marker holds it. Wait out the lease, or talk to the worker.
- **`held-by-live-work`** — The lease EXPIRED but the work did not: an open `item/<n>-*` PR is the worktree protocol's own artifact, and it outranks a timer. Not offered; its touch-set stays reserved.
- **`item-pr-open`** — No claim marker governs it, but an `item/<n>-*` PR is already OPEN on its branch — an implementation is in flight whether or not anyone claimed it. Not offered: claiming it would duplicate work that is already written (#651).
- **`overlaps-in-flight`** — Its files collide with work already in flight. The holder and its lease window are named, because "nothing schedulable" and "queued behind a claim that frees in ~96m" are the same fact and two completely different instructions.
- **`undetermined`** — WE COULD NOT DECIDE — and that is never a silent no. An unreachable answer is not a negative one. This is the case whose absence made every other case a lie waiting to happen.

## Setup

- The board `Status` already has `In progress`; `Blocked by` already sequences — **no board
  schema change is required**. A repo that wants touch-sets filterable MAY add an optional
  `Paths` text field, but the protocol reads the `Paths:` line from the issue body.
- `claim`/`release`/`say` need `issues: write`; board writes need
  `gh auth refresh -s project,read:project`, as the rest of `fsgg-coord` does.
- To activate this skill in a product repo, copy it into that repo's
  `.claude/skills/intra-repo-parallel-work/` (same as the cross-repo skill), and
  `.github/workflows/touch-set-drift.yml` for the advisory drift check.
