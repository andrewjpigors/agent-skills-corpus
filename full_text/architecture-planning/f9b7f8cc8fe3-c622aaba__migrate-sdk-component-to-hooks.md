# Migrating SDK Components to Hook-Based Architecture

In-tree reference implementations (in order of increasing complexity — start at the top):

- `src/components/Company/PaySchedule/PayScheduleForm.tsx` — **canonical single-hook migration** (`usePayScheduleForm`) using `BaseBoundaries` + `BaseLayout` + `SDKFormProvider`. Start here when migrating a one-hook screen.
- `src/components/Employee/Profile/onboarding/EmployeeProfile.tsx` — **canonical two-hook composition** (`useEmployeeDetailsForm` + `useCurrentHomeAddressForm`) with `composeSubmitHandler` ordering and partial-update recovery. Start here when migrating a multi-hook screen.
- `src/components/Employee/Compensation/EditCompensation/EditCompensation.tsx` — two-hook composition (`useJobForm` + `useCompensationForm`) demonstrating submit-time threading of a freshly-created parent's `currentCompensationUuid`/version into the next submit, plus `withHireDateField: false` / `withEffectiveDateField: false` to derive dates from external context.

**Advanced / exceptional reference — read for orientation, do _not_ copy the exception:**

- `src/components/Employee/Profile/onboarding/AdminProfile.tsx` — three-hook composition (`useEmployeeDetailsForm` + `useCurrentHomeAddressForm` + `useCurrentWorkAddressForm`) with `composeSubmitHandler` ordering, partial-update recovery, and `SDKFormProvider` + `formHookResult` props mixed on the same screen. This screen also stands up a raw `useForm` for `startDate` — a documented, non-canonical workaround for a date field that none of the existing hooks could own without introducing side effects on shared dates. **Do not use this as a template for new work.** When tempted to reach for raw `useForm` (or `useWatch`, `setValue`, or `hookFormInternals.formMethods.*`) in a component, push the field into an existing hook or scaffold a new one (`.claude/commands/create-hook.md`) — partners shouldn't have to know about react-hook-form internals to consume the SDK. If you genuinely believe you have another exception, stop and surface it to the reviewer with a written justification before merging.

Hooks reference: `.claude/hooks-implementation.md` — covers schema, fields, hook internals, error handling, and exports in detail. Read it before starting a migration.

Scaffolding a new hook from scratch: `.claude/commands/create-hook.md` walks through the file layout, schema/field/hook templates, barrel wiring, and verification steps.

## Core Principle: The Hook Owns the Business Logic

Before writing any logic in the component, read the hook. Hooks encapsulate field visibility, conditional requiredness, derived data, loading states, and submit behavior. The component is a thin rendering layer around whatever the hook already exposes.

Common anti-patterns to avoid:

- Reaching for `useWatch` to gate field visibility when the hook already returns the field as `undefined` when it shouldn't be shown
- Standing up a raw `useForm` in the component for fields that conceptually belong to one of the form hooks on the same screen (or for a brand-new field that no hook owns yet — scaffold a hook for it instead, see `.claude/commands/create-hook.md`)
- Pulling values via `hookResult.form.hookFormInternals.formMethods.*` to drive cross-field validation, requiredness, or submit ordering — that logic belongs inside the hook's schema/`requiredFieldsConfig`/`onSubmit`
- Duplicating the hook's requiredness logic via component-level conditionals
- Querying an entity in the component when the hook is already fetching and exposing it via `data` or `status`
- Computing derived values (e.g. "is this schedule in create vs edit mode") in the component when the hook surfaces them

**Rule of thumb**: if you're writing business logic in the component that every partner using the hook would also need, that logic belongs in the hook. Stop, move it into the hook, and re-export it via the hook's return shape. The SDK component and partner code should look identical in terms of which fields are shown and when.

**Hooks are partner-facing; react-hook-form is not.** Partners should be able to consume the hook's documented surface (`data`, `status`, `actions`, `errorHandling`, `form.Fields`, `form.fieldsMetadata`, `form.getFormSubmissionValues`) without ever importing from `react-hook-form` or touching `form.hookFormInternals`. If you find yourself reaching for `useWatch`, raw `useForm`, `setValue`, `watch`, or any other RHF internal in the component, that is a signal the hook is missing functionality — either there is already a hook return value for the case (use it) or the hook needs to be updated to cover it. `form.hookFormInternals` exists as an escape hatch for narrowly presentational, non-business-logic cases (see Section 6 → "Watching Form Values"); treat each new use site as a candidate for moving the logic into the hook.

## 0. Pre-Migration Test Coverage

Before touching any implementation code, spawn the **`sdk-premigration-tests`** agent to write thorough unit tests for the existing component. These tests are the regression safety net — they must pass before migration begins and again after it finishes.

Spawn the agent (foreground — wait for it to complete before proceeding):

- **description**: `"Write pre-migration tests for $COMPONENT_PATH"`
- **prompt**: `"Write pre-migration unit tests for the existing component at $COMPONENT_PATH before it is migrated to hook-based architecture."`

Review the test file the agent produces. If any required coverage area is missing or a test is failing, address it before writing a single line of migration code.

**What tests to keep after migration:** Tests for the component's public behavior (rendered output, events emitted, loading/error states) survive the migration unchanged. Tests for internal helpers, context providers, or sub-components deleted during cleanup (Section 9) are removed along with that code. Do not delete a test just because the internal structure changed — delete it only when the thing it tested no longer exists.

## 1. Component Structure

### Entry Point

The public component wraps `BaseBoundaries` and delegates to a single `Root` component that initializes the hook(s) and renders the form. `onEvent` is passed as a prop — do NOT use `BaseComponent` or `useBase()`. When admin and self-service flows diverge, create two separate public components rather than forking internally.

```tsx
interface MyComponentProps extends UseMyFormProps {
  onEvent: OnEventType<EventType, unknown>
}

export function MyComponent({ onEvent, ...hookProps }: MyComponentProps) {
  return (
    <BaseBoundaries componentName="Domain.MyComponent">
      <MyComponentRoot onEvent={onEvent} {...hookProps} />
    </BaseBoundaries>
  )
}

function MyComponentRoot({ onEvent, ...hookProps }: MyComponentProps) {
  const form = useMyForm(hookProps)
  // ...loading gate, handlers, render
}
```

#### Props: extend `BaseComponentInterface`, never intersect with `&`

A public component's props **interface** carries the base surface by extending `BaseComponentInterface<'Domain.MyComponent'>` (which itself extends `CommonComponentInterface`, providing `onEvent`, `children`, `className`, `dictionary`, `FallbackComponent`, and `LoaderComponent`). The exported function is typed with that single interface:

```tsx
export interface MyComponentProps extends BaseComponentInterface<'Domain.MyComponent'> {
  employeeId?: string
  // ...other inputs this component accepts
}

export function MyComponent(props: MyComponentProps) {
  /* ... */
}
```

Do **not** intersect the base into the function signature:

```tsx
// ❌ flagged in PR #2276 — breaks the generated docs
export function MyComponent(props: MyComponentProps & BaseComponentInterface) {
  /* ... */
}
```

`&` at the signature makes the docs generator inline the entire `BaseComponentInterface<…full resource-key union…>` into the `props` row, blowing up the generated reference table. `extends` instead renders the base props as the clean _"Inherits … from BaseComponentInterface"_ line.

If an internal/presentational child needs the props **without** the base-only fields, derive them with `Omit<MyComponentProps, BaseComponentKeys>` — don't strip the base off the public interface to build the child's type. (When the entry-point example above extends `UseMyFormProps`, extend `BaseComponentInterface<'Domain.MyComponent'>` alongside it to pick up `onEvent` and friends, rather than re-declaring them by hand.)

`BaseBoundaries` provides:

- `QueryErrorResetBoundary` — resets React Query errors on retry
- `ErrorBoundary` — catches render errors, shows `FallbackComponent` if supplied
- `Suspense` — shows a loading indicator while suspense hooks (like `useI18n` / `useTranslation`) resolve

Unlike `BaseComponent`, `BaseBoundaries` does NOT provide `BaseContext`. This means:

- `onEvent` is passed as a prop through to the `Root` component, not accessed via `useBase()`
- Error state is managed by the hooks' `errorHandling` bags, not `BaseContext`
- `BaseLayout` is used explicitly inside `Root` for loading/error display

### Suspense Boundary

`BaseBoundaries` provides a `Suspense` boundary. This is needed for `useI18n` / `useTranslation` and similar hooks that suspend. Prefer non-suspense queries for data fetching — the form hooks use regular queries internally and manage their own loading states via `isLoading`.

## 2. Hook Initialization

Initialize the hook(s) at the top of `Root`. When composing multiple form hooks, pass `shouldFocusError: false` to every hook so `composeSubmitHandler` manages cross-form focus instead of each hook competing for it.

```tsx
const employeeDetails = useEmployeeDetailsForm({
  companyId,
  employeeId,
  optionalFieldsToRequire,
  shouldFocusError: false,
})

const homeAddress = useHomeAddressForm({
  employeeId,
  shouldFocusError: false,
})
```

### Pre-Fill Default Values

When the component accepts partner pre-fill values and forwards them to the hook's `defaultValues`, pass them **straight through** — do not map field-by-field:

```tsx
// Good — the hook's defaultValues is the form-data shape; pass it through
const address = useContractorAddressForm({ contractorId, defaultValues })

// Bad — per-field `?? undefined` mapping to launder `null` out of the prop type
const address = useContractorAddressForm({
  contractorId,
  defaultValues: defaultValues
    ? { street1: defaultValues.street1 ?? undefined /* ...every field... */ }
    : undefined,
})
```

If you find yourself writing that mapping, the root cause is the **public pre-fill type**, not the call site. Type any component-level pre-fill type (e.g. `AddressDefaultValues`) off the hook's form-data type — `RequireAtLeastOne<{Domain}FormData>` or `Partial<{Domain}FormData>` — not off a `Pick` of the API entity. Entity types declare nullable fields as `string | null | undefined`; deriving the prop from them drags `null` into the partner type and forces the mapping. The form-data shape carries only `string`, so it's directly assignable to the hook's `defaultValues`. See `.claude/hooks-implementation.md` → "Form Defaults and Data Sync" for the hook-side rule (null is normalized once, inside `resolvedDefaults`).

### Partial Update Recovery (Create Mode)

When composing hooks that create entities sequentially (e.g. create employee → create home address → create work address), a mid-sequence failure can leave the first entity created and the downstream ones not. Without recovery, a retry would create a second root entity.

Three rules keep this correct and non-disruptive:

**1. Prefer the onSubmit escape hatch over component state.** Hooks typically accept an entity id as an `onSubmit` argument so a downstream hook can target a just-created parent without the component having to thread it through props. Use that first:

```tsx
const employeeResult = await employeeDetails.actions.onSubmit()
if (!employeeResult) return
await homeAddress.actions.onSubmit({ employeeId: employeeResult.data.uuid })
```

**2. Defer to the partner for id updates on success.** When creation succeeds, emit the created entity via `onEvent` and let the partner decide what to do — usually navigate away or pass the new id back through props. Do **not** stash the id in component state on success. Storing it triggers a re-render mid-submission, which can flip the hook back into loading state and unmount the form under the user.

**3. Only flip to update mode internally on failure.** If a create partially fails (root created, child errored), then — and only then — capture the created id in state so a retry targets the existing root instead of creating a duplicate:

```tsx
const [resolvedEmployeeId, setResolvedEmployeeId] = useState(employeeId)

// In the composed submit handler:
const employeeResult = await employeeDetails.actions.onSubmit()
if (!employeeResult) return

const newId = employeeResult.data.uuid

const homeResult = await homeAddress.actions.onSubmit({ employeeId: newId })
if (!homeResult) {
  if (!employeeId) setResolvedEmployeeId(newId) // recovery only
  return
}
// success path: no setState — partner navigates / re-renders via onEvent
```

Pass `resolvedEmployeeId` to downstream hooks so retries reuse the created root. `Employee.Profile` is the reference for this pattern.

### Consuming the Submit Result

Hook `onSubmit` actions return a `HookSubmitResult<Entity>` with the created/updated entity in `result.data`. Two conventions follow from this:

**1. Prefer `result.data` over callback arguments.** Do not add a callback argument to `onSubmit` for the sole purpose of exposing the final result — the return value already carries it:

```tsx
// Correct: read result.data directly
const result = await signForm.actions.onSubmit()
if (result) {
  onEvent(companyEvents.COMPANY_SIGN_FORM_DONE, result.data)
}
```

Callbacks on `onSubmit` are only appropriate when a hook makes **multiple sequential API calls inside a single submit** and partners need access to intermediate results that aren't otherwise surfaced in the final return value. `useEmployeeDetailsForm` is the canonical reference — on update it chains `updateEmployee` with `updateOnboardingStatus`, so a partner can observe the status flip between the two calls.

Rule of thumb: if the hook's `onSubmit` resolves to a single mutation per submit (including create-or-update routing where exactly one of the two fires), drop the callbacks interface entirely — `HookSubmitResult<TEntity>` already carries the saved entity and the mode. `useJobForm`, `useCompensationForm`, and `useHomeAddressForm` are reference cases for the no-callbacks shape; for chained submits across multiple hooks, prefer `composeSubmitHandler` over per-hook callbacks.

**2. Preserve the existing event surface when migrating.** The set of `onEvent` types a component emits — and their payloads — is the component's public contract with partners. A migration refactor must not add, remove, rename, or change the payload of any existing event. Before rewriting the submit handler, enumerate the events the pre-migration component emits (search `onEvent(` in the current file and any subcomponents it delegates to) and make sure every one still fires in the refactor, with the same payload shape, regardless of how the hook's `onSubmit` surfaces the data:

```tsx
// SignatureForm migration — pre-existing contract emits both events
const result = await signForm.actions.onSubmit()
if (result) {
  onEvent(companyEvents.COMPANY_SIGN_FORM, result.data) // preserve
  onEvent(companyEvents.COMPANY_SIGN_FORM_DONE) // preserve
}
```

Removing a documented event (or changing its payload) is a breaking change for partners and requires an explicit `feat!:` / `refactor!:` commit coordinated separately — it's not something a hook migration should quietly do.

**Shape conventions for new events.** When the component emits an event that didn't exist before (for example because the migration exposes a new intermediate entity), follow the conventions already used in the codebase:

- _New single-call component_ — emit one `_DONE` event carrying `result.data`. No separate "entity created" event. `EmploymentEligibility` (`EMPLOYEE_EMPLOYMENT_ELIGIBILITY_DONE, result.i9Authorization`) and `InformationRequestForm` (`INFORMATION_REQUEST_FORM_DONE, response.informationRequest`) are the reference cases.
- _New multi-call component_ — emit one intermediate event per API call (from hook callbacks or per-hook `result.data`) plus a terminal `_DONE` carrying whatever the partner needs at that boundary. `EmployeeProfile` and `AdminProfile` are the reference cases:

  ```tsx
  const employeeResult = await employeeDetails.actions.onSubmit({
    onEmployeeCreated: emp => onEvent(componentEvents.EMPLOYEE_CREATED, emp),
    onEmployeeUpdated: emp => onEvent(componentEvents.EMPLOYEE_UPDATED, emp),
    onOnboardingStatusUpdated: s => onEvent(componentEvents.EMPLOYEE_ONBOARDING_STATUS_UPDATED, s),
  })
  if (!employeeResult) return

  const homeResult = await homeAddress.actions.onSubmit({ employeeId: newEmployeeId })
  if (!homeResult) return
  onEvent(
    homeResult.mode === 'create'
      ? componentEvents.EMPLOYEE_HOME_ADDRESS_CREATED
      : componentEvents.EMPLOYEE_HOME_ADDRESS_UPDATED,
    homeResult.data,
  )

  onEvent(componentEvents.EMPLOYEE_PROFILE_DONE, { ...employeeResult.data, startDate })
  ```

These shape conventions govern **new** events added during a migration. They never override rule 2's parity requirement — when in doubt, match the existing event surface and leave shape-cleanup for a dedicated breaking-change PR.

## 3. Loading and Error States with BaseLayout

### Error Aggregation

Prefer `composeErrorHandler` / `composeSubmitHandler` over manual array spreading. These helpers produce a single `HookErrorHandling` bag — the same shape every SDK hook returns — that drives `BaseLayout`'s error alert, retry, and clear-submit-error behavior.

**For multiple form hooks composed on a page**, use `composeSubmitHandler` — it returns both the submit handler and an aggregated `errorHandling` covering every form passed in:

```tsx
const { handleSubmit, errorHandling } = composeSubmitHandler(
  [employeeDetails, homeAddress, workAddress],
  async () => {
    /* submit sequence */
  },
)
```

**For plain React Query fetches alongside hooks**, use `composeErrorHandler` to merge query errors and nested hook errors:

```tsx
const errorHandling = composeErrorHandler([workAddressesQuery, employeeDetails, homeAddress]) // mix of queries and hook results
```

The returned bag has `{ errors, retryQueries, clearSubmitError }`. Since the shape matches a hook's `errorHandling`, you can nest further by feeding a composed bag back in via `{ errorHandling }`.

The second argument — `{ submitError, setSubmitError }` from `useBaseSubmit` — is only relevant when the component itself runs a submit via `useBaseSubmit`. In a fully hook-driven migration the form hooks own their own submit state, so this can be omitted. Include it only if you have a screen-level submit outside the form hooks that needs to surface errors through the same `BaseLayout`.

### Loading Gate

When any hook is loading, render `BaseLayout` with `isLoading` and the composed errors. This shows a loading indicator, or errors if a query failed (so users see a retry option instead of an infinite spinner):

```tsx
if (employeeDetails.isLoading || homeAddress.isLoading || workAddress.isLoading) {
  return <BaseLayout isLoading error={errorHandling.errors} />
}
```

### Ready State

Wrap the form content in `BaseLayout` with the composed errors to display error alerts above the form:

```tsx
return (
  <section className={className}>
    <BaseLayout error={errorHandling.errors}>
      <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>{/* form content */}</Form>
    </BaseLayout>
  </section>
)
```

`BaseLayout` renders:

- Loading indicator when `isLoading` is true and no errors
- Error alert(s) above children when errors are present
- Just children when neither loading nor errored

## 4. SDKFormProvider and formHookResult Prop

Hook fields need form context (react-hook-form `Control`, fields metadata, errors). Two ways to provide it:

### SDKFormProvider

Wraps a contiguous group of fields from **one** hook. Provides `FormProvider` + `FormFieldsMetadataProvider` + API field error syncing.

```tsx
<SDKFormProvider formHookResult={workAddress}>
  <WorkAddressFields.Location label={t('workAddress')} />
  <WorkAddressFields.EffectiveDate label={t('startDate')} />
</SDKFormProvider>
```

### formHookResult Prop

Pass the hook result directly to each field. Use when fields from one hook are scattered across the layout (interleaved with other hooks' fields or non-field UI).

```tsx
<EmployeeFields.FirstName
  label={t('firstName')}
  formHookResult={employeeDetails}
  validationMessages={{ REQUIRED: t('validations.firstName') }}
/>
```

`FormHookResult` types `control` as `unknown` so any hook result is assignable without casts or generics. The single `as Control` cast lives inside `useHookFieldResolution`.

### Rules

1. **Do NOT nest `SDKFormProvider`s** — use sibling providers for different hooks
2. **Do NOT use both approaches for the same hook** — pick `SDKFormProvider` or `formHookResult` prop per hook, not both
3. **Do NOT render fields from a different hook inside an `SDKFormProvider`**

When a hook's fields are split across the layout, use `formHookResult` prop on **all** of that hook's fields.

## 5. Composing Submissions with composeSubmitHandler

`composeSubmitHandler` validates all forms simultaneously, focuses the first invalid field across forms, and only calls `onAllValid` when every form passes. It returns `{ handleSubmit, errorHandling }` — the `errorHandling` aggregates every form's error state so you can drive a single `BaseLayout` from it.

```tsx
const activeForms = [employeeDetails, ...(showHomeAddress ? [homeAddress] : []), workAddress]

const { handleSubmit, errorHandling } = composeSubmitHandler(activeForms, async () => {
  const employeeResult = await employeeDetails.actions.onSubmit({/* callbacks */})
  if (!employeeResult) return

  const newId = employeeResult.data.uuid

  if (showHomeAddress) {
    const homeResult = await homeAddress.actions.onSubmit({ employeeId: newId })
    if (!homeResult) {
      if (!employeeId) setResolvedEmployeeId(newId)
      return
    }
  }

  await workAddress.actions.onSubmit({/* callbacks */}, { employeeId: newId })
})
```

Key points:

- `activeForms` array determines which forms are validated and contributes to `errorHandling` — conditionally exclude forms whose sections are hidden
- Do NOT memoize `activeForms` or the `composeSubmitHandler` result — hook return values are not stable references
- Submit sequentially, checking each result — return early on failure to prevent cascading errors
- Update `resolvedEmployeeId` on partial failure in create mode
- Pass `errorHandling.errors` to `BaseLayout` for a unified error surface across all forms

### Adding Extra Queries

If the component has React Query fetches outside the form hooks (e.g. a read-only lookup), feed them through `composeErrorHandler` alongside the composed submit result:

```tsx
const { handleSubmit, errorHandling: formsErrorHandling } = composeSubmitHandler(
  [employeeDetails, homeAddress],
  async () => {
    /* ... */
  },
)

const errorHandling = composeErrorHandler([
  workAddressesQuery,
  { errorHandling: formsErrorHandling },
])

return <BaseLayout error={errorHandling.errors}>{/* ... */}</BaseLayout>
```

Pass `{ submitError, setSubmitError }` from `useBaseSubmit` as the second argument only if the component runs its own screen-level submit outside the form hooks. Most hook-driven migrations won't need it — the form hooks manage their own submit state.

## 6. Field Rendering

### Using Hook Fields

Each hook provides field components via `form.Fields`:

```tsx
const EmployeeFields = employeeDetails.form.Fields
const HomeAddressFields = homeAddress.form.Fields
```

### Conditional Fields

**The hook controls field visibility.** When a field shouldn't be shown, the hook returns it as `undefined` on `form.Fields`. Guard with a truthiness check and render — do **not** use `useWatch` or component-level state to decide whether a field should appear:

```tsx
{
  WorkAddressFields.EffectiveDate && <WorkAddressFields.EffectiveDate label={t('startDate')} />
}
```

If you find yourself manually gating visibility based on another field's value, that logic almost certainly belongs inside the hook's schema or `Fields` selection. Move it there instead of reproducing it per-component.

For fields whose applicability depends on another field's value (individual vs. business contractor, hourly vs. fixed wage, a self-onboarding toggle), the hook's schema gates them with a **value-aware `excludeFields` function** — `excludeFields: (data, mode) => string[]` — so requiredness checks are skipped while a field is inapplicable, and the hook returns that field as `undefined` on `form.Fields`. The component just renders whatever `Fields` exposes; it never re-derives the condition. See `.claude/hooks-implementation.md → Value-aware excludeFields` and `useContractorDetailsForm` for the canonical example.

### Validation Messages

Every field has typed error codes defined in its `fields.tsx`. Without `validationMessages`, the raw error code string (e.g. "REQUIRED") is displayed to the user.

#### How error code typing works

Field components have two generic parameters: `TErrorCode` (required keys) and `TOptionalErrorCode` (optional keys). The `ValidationMessages` type requires all `TErrorCode` keys and allows `TOptionalErrorCode` keys:

```typescript
// In fields.tsx — error codes derived from the schema's error codes constant
export type SsnValidation = typeof ErrorCodes.INVALID_SSN // required key
export type SsnRequiredValidation = typeof ErrorCodes.REQUIRED // optional key

export type SsnFieldProps = HookFieldProps<
  TextInputHookFieldProps<SsnValidation, SsnRequiredValidation>
  //                        ^required       ^optional
>
```

TypeScript enforces that all required keys are present. Optional keys are allowed but not enforced — provide them for any code that can realistically fire.

#### Wiring up validationMessages

Every field rendered in the component should have `validationMessages` covering all error codes that can fire. Check the field's type definition in `fields.tsx` to see which codes are required vs optional, then provide localized translations for each:

```tsx
<EmployeeFields.FirstName
  label={t('firstName')}
  validationMessages={{
    REQUIRED: t('validations.firstName'),      // required key — TypeScript enforces this
    INVALID_NAME: t('validations.firstName'),   // required key — TypeScript enforces this
  }}
/>

<EmployeeFields.Ssn
  label={t('ssnLabel')}
  validationMessages={{
    INVALID_SSN: t('validations.ssn', { ns: 'common' }),        // required key
    REQUIRED: t('validations.ssnRequired', { ns: 'common' }),   // optional key — but fires when field is required
  }}
/>
```

#### Translation placement

Validation translations should live in the component's translation namespace (e.g. `Employee.Profile.json`) or the `common.json` namespace for messages shared across components (e.g. SSN format, date of birth required). When migrating, check the existing component's translations and keep them consistent to avoid breaking changes.

#### When validationMessages can be omitted

- Fields whose error codes can never fire (e.g. `MiddleInitial` with `requiredFieldsConfig: 'never'` and no format validator)
- Boolean fields (checkbox/switch) — always have a value so `REQUIRED` never fires

### Select Fields with Translated Labels

**Translations must never live in hooks.** Hooks produce option values (form submission values) and provide raw entry data. The UI component owns all display-label translation.

The pattern for translatable select options uses two cooperating pieces:

**Hook side** — pass the raw entries array as the third argument to `withOptions`. The options array carries the abbreviation/value as a fallback label; entries carries the raw data the UI will translate:

```ts
// In the hook (e.g. useHomeAddressForm, useSignEmployeeForm)
const stateOptions = STATES_ABBR.map(abbr => ({ value: abbr, label: abbr }))

state: withOptions(baseMetadata.state, stateOptions, STATES_ABBR),
```

`withOptions` accepts `readonly TEntry[]` so `as const` arrays like `STATES_ABBR` work directly without spreading.

**Field type** — set `TEntry` on the field's `SelectHookFieldProps` to match the entries type, so `getOptionLabel` is typed correctly at the call site:

```ts
// In fields.tsx
export type StateFieldProps = HookFieldProps<SelectHookFieldProps<RequiredValidation, string>>
```

**Component side** — pass `getOptionLabel` to the field component. `SelectHookField` detects both `entries` on the metadata and `getOptionLabel` on the props, and rebuilds the option labels — the fallback abbreviation labels from the hook are never shown to the user:

```tsx
// In the UI component (e.g. AdminProfile, I9SignatureForm)
const { t: tCommon } = useTranslation('common')

<HomeAddressFields.State
  label={tHome('state')}
  placeholder={tHome('statePlaceholder')}
  validationMessages={{ REQUIRED: tHome('validations.state') }}
  getOptionLabel={(abbr: string) => tCommon(`statesHash.${abbr}`, { defaultValue: abbr })}
/>
```

Use `{ defaultValue: abbr }` (or another known-string overload) when passing a template literal key to `t` — i18next's typed `t` function requires exact key literals and won't accept a `` `namespace.${string}` `` template directly. The `defaultValue` forces a permissive overload that returns `string`, which is the pattern used throughout the codebase.

**Do NOT use a raw `<SelectField>` inside an `SDKFormProvider` to work around a hook whose state options are abbreviation-only.** That is an anti-pattern. Add `entries` to the hook's `withOptions` call and use `getOptionLabel` on the hook's field component instead.

### Watching Form Values

`useWatch` is a last resort — reach for it only when the reactive behavior is genuinely presentational and has no business meaning (e.g. showing a non-functional preview panel). Anything that affects which fields render, which are required, or which get submitted belongs in the hook.

When `useWatch` is the right tool, use it with the hook's `control`:

```tsx
const watchedValue = useWatch({
  control: hookResult.form.hookFormInternals.formMethods.control,
  name: 'fieldName',
})
```

For read-only access at submit time (no re-renders on change), use `getFormSubmissionValues()`:

```tsx
const startDate = workAddress.form.getFormSubmissionValues()?.effectiveDate
```

## 7. i18n

- Call `useI18n('Namespace')` for each translation namespace the component uses
- Call `useComponentDictionary('Namespace', dictionary)` to merge partner overrides
- Use `useTranslation('Namespace')` for the `t` function
- Keep translations consistent with the existing component to avoid breaking changes

## 8. Events

`onEvent` is received as a prop on the public component and passed through to `Root` — do NOT use `useBase()`:

```tsx
function Root({ onEvent, ...props }: MyComponentProps) {
  // ...
  onEvent(componentEvents.EMPLOYEE_PROFILE_DONE, { ...data })
}
```

## 9. Cleanup: Legacy Patterns to Remove

The pre-hook components were built around a pattern that split a single screen into inline sub-components (`Head`, `Actions`, specific field groups like `WorkAddress`, `HomeAddress`, `PersonalDetails`) backed by a domain context (e.g. `ProfileContext`) to thread form state, handlers, and flags between them. A thin monolithic file then wired everything together.

The hook + `Root` shape replaces that entirely:

- The hook owns state, validation, and submit logic
- `Root` is the view layer that composes the hook and renders fields inline

There's no longer a reason to split a single screen into `Head` / `Actions` / per-section files, and no reason for a sibling context to share form state — the hook result is the shared state. Keep `Root` as a flat, readable component. Only extract presentational fragments when they're genuinely reused or independently testable, not as a reflex.

After migration, remove:

- [ ] Old monolithic form component files
- [ ] Inline sub-components (`Head`, `Actions`, per-section field groupings) — their contents move into `Root`
- [ ] Domain context providers (e.g. `ProfileContext`) that existed to share form state across those sub-components
- [ ] Helper utilities only used by the old implementation
- [ ] Tests for deleted helpers
- [ ] Unused imports in barrel files

Verify hook placement:

- [ ] Hook placed in `src/components/<Domain>/<Feature>/shared/use<Name>Form/`
- [ ] Hook exported from the feature-level barrel and from the SDK root barrel (if it is a public partner hook)

## 10. Hook Placement

All form hooks live inside a `shared/` directory scoped to the domain feature, one directory per hook:

```text
src/components/<Domain>/<Feature>/shared/
└── use<Name>Form/
    ├── use<Name>Form.tsx       # hook implementation
    ├── <camelDomain>Schema.ts  # Zod schema + error codes constant (e.g. employeeDetailsSchema.ts, homeAddressSchema.ts, compensationSchema.ts, jobSchema.ts)
    ├── fields.tsx              # Fields.* components wired to the hook
    ├── index.ts                # public re-exports
    └── use<Name>Form.test.tsx  # hook unit tests
```

Reference examples (read the closest match before scaffolding):

- `src/components/Employee/Profile/shared/useEmployeeDetailsForm/` — chained mutations per submit (`updateEmployee` + `updateOnboardingStatus`); single hook that needs `*SubmitCallbacks`
- `src/components/Employee/Profile/shared/useHomeAddressForm/` — single-mutation create-or-update; optional `homeAddressUuid` switches modes; `withEffectiveDateField` flag
- `src/components/Employee/Profile/shared/useWorkAddressForm/` — list-query (company locations) feeding a Select via `withOptions`; create-or-update with effective-date handling
- `src/components/Employee/Compensation/shared/useJobForm/` — predicate-based requiredness (`stateWcCovered → stateWcClassCode required`), radio coercion via `coerceStringBoolean`
- `src/components/Employee/Compensation/shared/useCompensationForm/` — cross-field `superRefine`, conditional fields, reactive `status.willDeleteSecondaryJobs` flag exposed to partners
- `src/components/Company/PaySchedule/shared/usePayScheduleForm/` — company-domain hook with admin-only fields and a calendar preview side query

### Steps

1. If `shared/` does not exist under the feature directory, create it
2. Create the `use<Name>Form/` directory inside `shared/`
3. Create the five files above; do not add extra files unless the hook genuinely needs them
4. Export the hook (and its types, error codes constant, and `Fields`) from `index.ts` inside the hook directory
5. Re-export from the feature-level barrel (e.g. `src/components/Employee/Profile/index.ts`) and from the SDK root barrel (`src/index.ts`) if the hook is intended as a public partner API

## 11. Documentation

Once the migration is complete and tests are passing, run `/tsdoc` to document the new hook before opening the PR. The skill writes TSDoc inline in the source — no separate doc files needed.

Key symbols to document: `useXxxForm`, `UseXxxProps`, `UseXxxFormOutputs` (or equivalent return type alias), and any other exports from the hook's `index.ts`. The `/tsdoc` session will load `.claude/tsdoc-guides/hooks.md` for hook-specific guidance.

## 12. Migration Checklist

- [ ] Pre-migration unit tests written covering all required areas (Section 0) and passing before migration began
- [ ] Public component wraps `BaseBoundaries` (not `BaseComponent`) and delegates to a single `Root`
- [ ] All hooks initialized with `shouldFocusError: false`
- [ ] Errors composed via `composeSubmitHandler` (multi-form) and/or `composeErrorHandler` (extra queries / submit state) rather than manual array spreading
- [ ] Loading state uses `<BaseLayout isLoading error={errorHandling.errors} />`
- [ ] Ready state wraps content in `<BaseLayout error={errorHandling.errors}>`
- [ ] SDKFormProvider rules followed (no nesting, no mixing, no cross-hook fields)
- [ ] `composeSubmitHandler` used for multi-hook forms, not memoized
- [ ] Partial update recovery handled for create mode
- [ ] All field error codes have `validationMessages` for codes that can realistically fire
- [ ] Select fields with translated labels use `getOptionLabel` on the hook's field component — no raw `<SelectField>` override inside `SDKFormProvider`
- [ ] `onEvent` passed as prop (not via `useBase()`)
- [ ] i18n namespaces loaded and translations consistent with prior component
- [ ] Dead code from old implementation removed
- [ ] Hook placed in `src/components/<Domain>/<Feature>/shared/use<Name>Form/` and exported from barrels
- [ ] All tests pass after migration (`npm run test -- --run`)
- [ ] TSDoc added to all exported hook symbols — `useXxxForm`, `UseXxxProps`, `UseXxxFormOutputs`
