# DevExpress Blazor Reporting — Viewer & Designer Integration

Integrates DevExpress report viewing and designing into Blazor applications. Five components across three families cover every Blazor hosting model.

This skill covers **Blazor UI component integration only**. For creating reports programmatically (bands, controls, data binding, export), use the `devexpress-reports-core` skill.

> **Skill boundary — hard stop**: This skill does NOT generate `XtraReport` subclasses, band declarations (`DetailBand`, `GroupHeaderBand`), or control code (`XRLabel`, `XRTable`, etc.). If a report class is needed, switch to `devexpress-reports-core` for that part, get the class name or instance, then return here to wire it into the viewer.

---

## Agent Workflow — Three Required Phases

**Do not write any code until all three phases are complete.** This ensures you load the correct reference files and generate a single coherent step-by-step plan.

- **Phase 1** — Search the project and ask clarifying questions for any unknowns
- **Phase 2** — Apply the decision gates to select the exact component and architecture
- **Phase 3** — Load the matching reference files, merge their steps, present the plan, then execute

---

## Phase 1 — Preflight: Gather Context

### Step 1 — Automated Discovery (Do Before Asking Anything)

Run these searches in the project before asking the developer:

1. **Installed packages**: `dotnet list package` → look for `DevExpress.Blazor.Reporting.*` and their versions
2. **Blazor configuration classification** — follow this 4-step algorithm and record the result before selecting any component:

   **Step A — Solution structure**: Find all `.csproj` files. Is there a `.Client` project (name suffix or a `<ProjectReference>` from a server project pointing to a client project)?

   **Step B — Server `Program.cs`** (look for `AddRazorComponents` call chain):

   | What is found | Preliminary result |
   |---|---|
   | `AddRazorComponents()` with no `AddInteractiveServerComponents()` or `AddInteractiveWebAssemblyComponents()` | → **Static** |
   | `AddInteractiveServerComponents()` only | → **Interactive Server** |
   | `AddInteractiveWebAssemblyComponents()` only | → **Interactive WebAssembly (Client + Server)** |
   | Both `AddInteractiveServerComponents()` + `AddInteractiveWebAssemblyComponents()` | → Auto candidate; confirm in Step D |

   **Step C — Client `Program.cs`**: presence of `WebAssemblyHostBuilder.CreateDefault(args)` confirms a WASM client project. If this file exists without a server `Program.cs` that calls `MapRazorComponents` → **Interactive WebAssembly Standalone**.

   **Step D — `@rendermode` in `.razor` files** (search `App.razor`, `Routes.razor`, all `@page` components):

   | Directive / parameter | Indicates |
   |---|---|
   | `@rendermode InteractiveServer` | Interactive Server |
   | `@rendermode InteractiveWebAssembly` | Interactive WebAssembly |
   | `@rendermode InteractiveAuto` or `new InteractiveAutoRenderMode(...)` | **Interactive Auto** |
   | No directives and no `AddInteractive*` in `Program.cs` | Static |

   > **Key rule**: Both `AddInteractiveServerComponents()` + `AddInteractiveWebAssemblyComponents()` in `Program.cs` does **not** alone mean Auto mode. Final classification uses the `@rendermode` directives actually present in components.

   **Final result** — record one of: **Static** | **Interactive Server** | **Interactive WebAssembly Standalone** | **Interactive WebAssembly (Client + Server)** | **Interactive Auto**. If ambiguous, ask the user for the Visual Studio template name or the `dotnet new` command used to create the project.

3. **Existing viewer/designer components**: search all `.razor` files for `<DxReportViewer`, `<DxDocumentViewer`, `<DxReportDesigner`, `<DxWasmDocumentViewer`, `<DxWasmReportDesigner` — note component names and file locations
4. **Report sources and name resolution**: search for `new XtraReport()`, `IReportProvider`, `IReportProviderAsync`, `ReportStorageWebExtension`, `OpenReportAsync`, `Report="@`, `ReportName="`, XtraReport loading methods (`FromXmlStream`, `LoadLayoutFromXml`, etc.) calls.
5. **Data and connection strings**: search `appsettings.json` for connection strings; search `.cs` files for custom data record classes used as report data sources
6. **Navigation menu structure**:
   - Search for navigation components: `NavMenu.razor`, `NavBar.razor`, or any `.razor` file with `<NavLink>` tags
   - Typical location: `Components/`, `Layouts/`, or root
   - Record the exact file path and one example `<NavLink>` element (copy its attributes, CSS classes, icon structure)
   - Identify the pattern: flat list vs. grouped categories
   - Record the route naming convention used (e.g., `/viewer`, `/reports`, `/designer`)

7. **(Custom data source discovery)** — only if a document viewer with storage or a designer component is found or requested:
   - Search report class files for `[DataSource]`, `ObjectDataSource`, `List<T>`, `IList` properties
   - Extract class names used as data sources (e.g., `SalesData`, `ProductRecord`)
   - Record which classes need trust registration (see Phase 2 Decision Gate F)

Record findings. Use them to answer questions below without prompting the developer.

#### After Discovery: New Component Evaluation

**Apply this evaluation immediately after completing items 1–5 above — before asking any clarifying questions.**

Using the results from item 3 above, determine:

**If existing reporting components were found (item 3) AND the user is requesting a new component (different from what is already there):**

1. **Record the new component name explicitly** — e.g., "User is adding `DxReportDesigner`; project already has `DxReportViewer` + `DxWasmDocumentViewer`"
2. **Do NOT assume the existing setup applies** — each component has distinct requirements. For example: 
   - Report Viewer: no controllers required
   - Document Viewers: 1 controller (`WebDocumentViewerController`)
   - Designers: 3 controllers (`WebDocumentViewerController` + `ReportDesignerController` + `QueryBuilderController`)
   - Different component families require different `AddDevExpress*()` registrations
3. **Run the rest of Phase 1–3 for the new component alone**, as if it were a first integration — then merge with the existing setup only at Phase 3 Step 2
4. **At Phase 3 merge**: check for conflicts with existing setup (see anti-pattern checks C20–C23)
5. **Extract the page route** from the new page's `@page` directive (e.g., `@page "/reports/viewer"`) — use this for the navigation link in Phase 3 Step 3B

**If no existing components were found, or the user is adding the same component type again:** proceed normally.

### Step 2 — Clarifying Questions (Ask Only for Unknowns)

Ask only for items that automated discovery could not determine. Combine unresolved items into **one message** — do not ask one question at a time.

| # | What to resolve | Ask when |
|---|-----------------|----------|
| Q1 | **Blazor configuration classification**: Static / Interactive Server / WASM Standalone / WASM Client+Server / Interactive Auto? | Phase 1 Step 1 item 2 result is ambiguous; apply Q1 script below |
| Q2 | **Component needed**: Native Viewer or JS-based Viewer? | User said "viewer" without specifying; apply Q2 script below |
| Q3 | **Report source**: existing report class, by name via a service, or a new sample report is needed? | No report class, `IReportProvider`, or `ReportStorageWebExtension` found in project; apply Q3 script below |
| Q4 | **Target project for new page**: In multi-project WASM setups, which project should receive the new page — server or client? Also needed for Phase 3 Step 3B navigation link addition. | User requested a new page in a multi-project solution (WASM Client+Server or Interactive Auto); apply Q4 script below |

#### Q1 Script — Ambiguous Blazor Configuration

When Phase 1 Step 1 item 2 (4-step classification algorithm) cannot determine the hosting mode unambiguously, ask the developer directly to identify their target configuration and the project for component integration:

> "I couldn't auto-detect your Blazor configuration. Which hosting model applies?
> **Static** / **Interactive Server** / **Interactive WebAssembly Standalone** / **Interactive WebAssembly (Client + Server)** / **Interactive Auto**
>
> For multi-project options (Client + Server or Auto): should the viewer/designer page go in the **Server** or **Client** project?"

Use the developer's responses to immediately confirm the hosting mode and target project, bypassing the need for further investigation.


#### Q2 Script — Viewer Ambiguity

When the user requests "a report viewer" without naming a component, present this choice explicitly:

> "There are two viewer options — which fits your needs?
> - **Native Blazor Viewer** (`DxReportViewer`) — pure C# customization, no JavaScript required, works on Blazor Server and WebAssembly
> - **JS-Based Document Viewer** (`DxDocumentViewer` / `DxWasmDocumentViewer`) — JavaScript callbacks, mobile-friendly, includes rich export panel, requires MVC middleware
>
> Which would you like?"

#### Q3 Script — No Reports Found in Project

When no report class, `IReportProvider`, or `ReportStorageWebExtension` is found:

> "No reports were found in the project. How would you like to provide one?
> 1. **Create a new sample report** — I'll use the `devexpress-reports-core` skill to generate a report class
> 2. **Use an existing `.repx` file** — point me to it and I'll wire it in via a report storage or provider
> 3. **Implement a report provider** — I'll create the report myself"

If the developer chooses option 1: **immediately load the `devexpress-reports-core` skill** (or launch a subagent using that skill if the environment supports `runSubagent`). Confirm the generated report class name with the developer before proceeding with viewer integration. Do not proceed until a report class name is available.

#### Q4 Script — Target Project for New Page in Multi-Project Solutions

When the user requests a new page to be added to the project and the configuration is **Interactive WebAssembly (Client + Server)** or **Interactive Auto**, confirm the target project. Use the **automatic assignment table** from Decision Gate D if the component family is already known, or ask explicitly:

> "Your project has a server project (`[ServerProjectName]`) and a client project (`[ClientProjectName]`). Which project should receive the new viewer/designer page?
> - **Server project** — for `DxWasmDocumentViewer`, `DxWasmReportDesigner`, `DxReportViewer` (not available in Interactive Auto) or if you prefer server-side report processing
> - **Client project** — for `DxDocumentViewer`, `DxReportDesigner`, `DxReportViewer` (not available in Interactive Auto) or if you prefer client-side WASM execution"

If the component is already determined (e.g., user explicitly said "`DxDocumentViewer`"), use the automatic assignment from Decision Gate D and confirm:

> "For `DxDocumentViewer` in Interactive WebAssembly mode, the page belongs in `[ClientProjectName]`. Proceed?"

---

## Phase 2 — Component and Architecture Selection

### Decision Gate 0 — Blazor Configuration × Component Compatibility (Mandatory First Step)

Use the Blazor configuration result from Phase 1, Step 1 item 2. Before selecting any component, apply the matrix below to filter the valid options.

#### Hosting Mode × Component Compatibility

| Component | Static | Interactive Server | WASM Standalone | WASM Client+Server | Interactive Auto |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `DxReportViewer` | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ not supported |
| `DxDocumentViewer` | ❌ | ✅ (server) | ✅ | ✅ `.Client` project only | ✅ `.Client` project only |
| `DxReportDesigner` | ❌ | ✅ (server) | ✅ | ✅ `.Client` project only | ✅ `.Client` project only |
| `DxWasmDocumentViewer` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ server project only | ✅ server project only |
| `DxWasmReportDesigner` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ server project only | ✅ server project only |

**If Static**: No DevExpress reporting component works in static render mode. Explain the limitation and suggest enabling Interactive Server mode (`AddInteractiveServerComponents()` + `@rendermode InteractiveServer` on the page).

**If `DxReportViewer` + Interactive Auto**: Incompatible combination. Explain the limitation and offer `DxDocumentViewer` (in `.Client`) or `DxReportDesigner` (in `.Client`) as alternatives. Do not proceed with `DxReportViewer` integration.

**If Interactive WebAssembly (Client + Server) or Interactive Auto**: After selecting the component, proceed to **Decision Gate D** to confirm the target project before writing any code.

---

### Component Family Overview

| | `DxReportViewer` | `DxDocumentViewer` | `DxReportDesigner` | `DxWasmDocumentViewer` | `DxWasmReportDesigner` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Type | **Native Blazor** | JS-based | JS-based | JS-based (WASM) | JS-based (WASM) |
| Purpose | Viewer | Viewer | Designer + embedded Viewer | Viewer | Designer + embedded Viewer |
| Render mode | Server or WebAssembly |  Server **or** Standalone WASM | Server **or** Standalone WASM | WebAssembly only | WebAssembly only |
| Customization | C# callbacks | JavaScript callbacks | JavaScript callbacks | JavaScript callbacks | JavaScript callbacks |
| Requires MVC controllers | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| NuGet | `Blazor.Reporting.Viewer` | `JSBasedControls` + `AspNetCore.Reporting` | Server: same as Viewer; WASM: `JSBasedControls` + Skia | Client: `JSBasedControls.WebAssembly` | same as DxWasmDocumentViewer |

> **Do not mix API families.** `OnCustomizeToolbar`/`ExportModel` are C# and work only on `DxReportViewer`. `CustomizeMenuActions`/`CustomizeExportOptions` are JavaScript callbacks and work only on JS-based components. Crossing families causes silent failures or `undefined` errors.

### Decision Gate A — User Need → Component

| User need | Component |
|-----------|-----------|
| View reports with C# customization | **`DxReportViewer`** (native) |
| View reports with JavaScript events / mobile support | **`DxDocumentViewer`** (or **`DxWasmDocumentViewer`**) |
| End-user report design and saving with an embedded viewer | **`DxReportDesigner`** (or **`DxWasmReportDesigner`**) |
| Design and view reports on separate pages | **`DxDocumentViewer`** (or **`DxWasmDocumentViewer`**) + **`DxReportDesigner`** (or **`DxWasmReportDesigner`**) |

### Decision Gate B — Hosting Model → JS-Based Viewer Architecture

| Blazor hosting model | Component | Target project | Reference |
|----------------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| **Interactive Server** (single project, SignalR) | `DxDocumentViewer` | Server | 📄 [references/getting-started-js-viewer-server.md](references/getting-started-js-viewer-server.md) |
| **Standalone WebAssembly** (no backend) | `DxDocumentViewer` | Only project | 📄 [references/getting-started-js-viewer-standalone-wasm.md](references/getting-started-js-viewer-standalone-wasm.md) |
| **Interactive WebAssembly (Client + Server)** | `DxWasmDocumentViewer` | Server project | 📄 [references/getting-started-js-viewer-interactive-wasm.md](references/getting-started-js-viewer-interactive-wasm.md) |
| **Interactive Auto** | `DxDocumentViewer` in `.Client`; or `DxWasmDocumentViewer` on server — see Decision Gate D | See Gate D | Same as Interactive WebAssembly (Client + Server): 📄 [references/getting-started-js-viewer-interactive-wasm.md](references/getting-started-js-viewer-interactive-wasm.md) |


### Decision Gate C — Hosting Model → JS-Based Designer Architecture

| Blazor hosting model | Component | Target project | Reference |
|----------------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| **Interactive Server** (single project, SignalR) | `DxReportDesigner` | Server | 📄 [references/getting-started-js-designer-server.md](references/getting-started-js-designer-server.md) |
| **Standalone WebAssembly** (no backend; Skia runs in browser) | `DxReportDesigner` | Only project | 📄 [references/getting-started-js-designer-standalone-wasm.md](references/getting-started-js-designer-standalone-wasm.md) |
| **Interactive WebAssembly (Client + Server)** | `DxWasmReportDesigner` | Server project | 📄 [references/getting-started-js-designer-interactive-wasm.md](references/getting-started-js-designer-interactive-wasm.md) |
| **Interactive Auto** | `DxReportDesigner` in `.Client`; or `DxWasmReportDesigner` on server — see Decision Gate D | See Gate D | Same as Interactive WebAssembly (Client + Server): 📄 [references/getting-started-js-designer-interactive-wasm.md](references/getting-started-js-designer-interactive-wasm.md) |

### Decision Gate D — Target Project in Multi-Project Solutions

**Apply this gate when the configuration is Interactive WebAssembly (Client + Server) or Interactive Auto and a component has been selected.**

#### Automatic assignment (propose and confirm — no open question needed)

| Component | Target project for `.razor` page | Service registration | Reason |
|-----------|----------------|--------|--------|
| `DxDocumentViewer` | `.Client` project | `.Client` `Program.cs` | Must execute in the browser WASM context |
| `DxReportDesigner` | `.Client` project | `.Client` `Program.cs` | Must execute in the browser WASM context |
| `DxWasmDocumentViewer` | `.Client` project | Server `Program.cs` | Component runs in browser (`.Client`); backend services and HTTP endpoints on server |
| `DxWasmReportDesigner` | `.Client` project | Server `Program.cs` | Component runs in browser (`.Client`); backend services and HTTP endpoints on server |

For automatically assigned cases, present a confirmation before proceeding:

**For `DxDocumentViewer` or `DxReportDesigner`:**
> "For `DxDocumentViewer` / `DxReportDesigner` in Interactive WebAssembly / Auto mode, the component and its service registration go in `[ClientProjectName]`. Proceed?"

**For `DxWasmDocumentViewer` or `DxWasmReportDesigner`:**
> "For `DxWasmDocumentViewer` / `DxWasmReportDesigner` in Interactive WebAssembly / Auto mode, the `.razor` page goes in `[ClientProjectName]` (component runs in the browser), but service registration and controllers go in the server `Program.cs`. Proceed?"

#### When the target project is ambiguous

If the user's project structure or component choice does not map unambiguously to the table above, ask:

> "Detected **[configuration type]** with two projects:
> - Server: `[ServerProjectName]`
> - Client: `[ClientProjectName]`
>
> `[ComponentName]` can be added to [server / client / either] project. Which project should receive the component?"
``
---

### Decision Gate F — Custom Data Source Mapping for Deserialization

**Apply when a designer component is selected, OR a viewer component with ReportStorageWebExtension is being used.**

**Purpose**: Identify custom data source classes needing trust registration for report deserialization (both designer save/load/preview and viewer storage access).

**When to apply**: (`DxReportDesigner` / `DxWasmReportDesigner` / `DxDocumentViewer` / `DxWasmDocumentViewer` with `ReportStorageWebExtension`) is being added AND Phase 1 Step 1 item 7 found custom data source classes.

**Quick check**:
1. List data source classes from Phase 1 item 7 discovery
2. For each: custom class? Used in reports? Both type and array variant needed?
3. Record decision: "Classes needing trust: [list]"

**Why**: Unregistered custom types cause `NonTrustedTypeDeserializationException` at runtime when:
- Designer components save/load/preview reports containing custom data sources
- Viewer components load reports from storage (`ReportStorageWebExtension` or `IReportProvider` returning REPX)

See 📄 [references/resolving-report-names.md — Data Source Trust Registration](resolving-report-names.md#security-trusted-types-for-custom-data-source-deserialization) for mapping details and registration procedures.

#### Integration output rules for multi-project solutions

Every generated integration must:

- Register services in the **correct** `Program.cs` (server or client, per the matrix above)
- Place the `.razor` page or component file in the **correct** project
- Include the correct `@rendermode` directive (or note that it is inherited from a global setting)
- Add a comment explaining why each file is placed in that specific project

---

## Phase 3 — Reference Loading, Validation, and Execution

**After resolving Phases 1 and 2**, follow all four steps below in order. Do not skip to step 4.

### Step 1 — Load Reference Files

Load every file listed for your scenario. Read all of them before drafting anything.

#### Scenario A — Native Viewer (`DxReportViewer`)

1. Load 📄 [references/getting-started-native-viewer.md](references/getting-started-native-viewer.md)
2. Load 📄 [references/resolving-report-names.md](references/resolving-report-names.md) — if using `IReportProvider` or if no report source was found in the project
3. Load 📄 [references/customizing-native-viewer.md](references/customizing-native-viewer.md) — if toolbar, export formats, zoom, or parameter editor customization was requested

#### Scenario B — JS-Based Viewer (`DxDocumentViewer` / `DxWasmDocumentViewer`)

1. From **Decision Gate B**, load the matching getting-started file (server / standalone-wasm / interactive-wasm — file names use `-interactive-wasm` suffix)
2. Load 📄 [references/resolving-report-names.md](references/resolving-report-names.md) — always; the viewer requires a name resolution service to load reports by string name
3. Load 📄 [references/customizing-js-viewer.md](references/customizing-js-viewer.md) — if toolbar commands, export filtering, panel visibility, or client-side events were requested

#### Scenario C — JS-Based Designer (`DxReportDesigner` / `DxWasmReportDesigner`)

1. From **Decision Gate C**, load the matching getting-started file (server / standalone-wasm / interactive-wasm — file names use `-interactive-wasm` suffix)
2. Load 📄 [references/resolving-report-names.md](references/resolving-report-names.md) — always; the designer always requires `ReportStorageWebExtension` (or `IReportProviderAsync` for standalone WASM)
3. Load 📄 [references/customizing-js-designer.md](references/customizing-js-designer.md) — if wizard customization, toolbar, panels, or lifecycle event callbacks were requested

#### Mixed Scenario — Viewer + Designer in the Same Project

Load reference files for both scenarios. Identify shared setup steps (Program.cs service registration, App.razor scripts, `_Imports.razor`) and deduplicate them in the merged plan.

> ⚠ **Service conflict check**: If both `DxReportViewer` (native) and `DxReportDesigner` (JS-based) exist in the same project, check for an `IReportProvider` + `ReportStorageWebExtension` conflict before proceeding. See **Constraint 16** and 📄 [references/resolving-report-names.md](references/resolving-report-names.md).

### Step 2 — Draft the Merged Plan

Merge all loaded steps into a **single numbered plan** ordered by execution sequence. Deduplicate shared setup steps (Program.cs, App.razor, `_Imports.razor`). Do not present or execute yet.

### Step 3A — Anti-Pattern Gate (Mandatory Before Presenting the Plan)

**Before presenting the plan to the developer, review every step of the draft against this checklist. If any item is violated, fix the draft first.**

Universal checks — apply regardless of scenario:

- [ ] **C3** — Every reporting component page has `@rendermode InteractiveServer` or `@rendermode InteractiveWebAssembly` (except Interactive WebAssembly Standalone — no `@rendermode` needed for entirely client-side apps)
- [ ] **C4** — `DxResourceManager.RegisterScripts()` is in `App.razor <head>`, not in a page or component
- [ ] **C5** — Service registration matches the component family and hosting mode (native + Interactive Server → `AddDevExpressServerSideBlazorReportViewer`; native + WASM Standalone → `AddDevExpressWebAssemblyBlazorReportViewer()`; JS-based → `AddDevExpressBlazorReporting`); no cross-family mixing
- [ ] **C6** — `report.CreateDocument()` is never called synchronously; only `await report.CreateDocumentAsync()`
- [ ] **C15** — `IReportProvider` is registered **after** `AddDevExpressBlazorReporting()` / `AddDevExpressServerSideBlazorReportViewer()` / `AddDevExpressWebAssemblyBlazorReportViewer()`
- [ ] **C16** — `IReportProvider` and `ReportStorageWebExtension` are not both registered in the same DI container
- [ ] **A6** — `XtraReport.FromXmlStream()` is used everywhere a report is loaded from bytes/stream; `LoadLayoutFromXml()` does not appear
- [ ] **A7** — `DeserializationSettings.RegisterTrustedClass()` is called for every custom data source class used in a report, placed **before** `var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args)`
- [ ] **A8** — `RegisterTrustedAssembly()` is not used in place of per-type `RegisterTrustedClass()`
- [ ] **A11** — No `new XtraReport()` with no bands is passed to a viewer; a real report class with at least a `DetailBand` is used
- [ ] **A16** — No component family change was introduced on an existing page unless the user explicitly requested migration
- [ ] **C17** — In multi-project solutions (Interactive WebAssembly Client+Server or Auto), each component is placed and services are registered correctly per Decision Gate D: `DxDocumentViewer` / `DxReportDesigner` (component + services in `.Client`); `DxWasmDocumentViewer` / `DxWasmReportDesigner` (component page in `.Client`, but services in server `Program.cs`)
- [ ] **C20** — When adding a new component to an existing project, Phase 1 Step 0 (New Component Detection) was applied FIRST — the agent did not assume existing setup patterns
- [ ] **C21** — All required controllers for the new component are implemented per its component family:
  - Viewers (`DxReportViewer`, `DxDocumentViewer`, `DxWasmDocumentViewer`): only `WebDocumentViewerController` required
  - Designers (`DxReportDesigner`, `DxWasmReportDesigner`): ALL THREE required: `WebDocumentViewerController`, `ReportDesignerController`, `QueryBuilderController`
  - If missing: the build succeeds but runtime fails on data source wizard or save/load dialogs
- [ ] **C22** — New component's controller-specific namespace imports are in place:
  - Designer requires: `DevExpress.AspNetCore.Reporting.QueryBuilder`, `DevExpress.AspNetCore.Reporting.ReportDesigner`, `DevExpress.AspNetCore.Reporting.WebDocumentViewer`
  - Viewer only requires: `DevExpress.AspNetCore.Reporting.WebDocumentViewer`
- [ ] **C23** — If adding a designer to a project with an existing native viewer:
  - Verify no `IReportProvider` and `ReportStorageWebExtension` conflict (see Constraint 16)
  - Designer requires `ReportStorageWebExtension` for persistence; if project already has `IReportProvider`, remove it or replace with storage
- [ ] **C24** — If a new `.razor` page is being added, a matching `<NavLink>` entry will be added to the navigation component (see Phase 3 Step 3B) with correct and route name
- [ ] **C26 (NEW)** — For components with custom data sources (designer components OR viewers with storage): All data source classes registered with `RegisterTrustedClass()`, array types registered separately, registrations before `CreateBuilder()`. See 📄 [references/resolving-report-names.md](resolving-report-names.md#security-trusted-types-for-custom-data-source-deserialization) for details.

Scenario-specific checks — also review the `## Antipatterns` section of **every reference file loaded in Step 1**. Fix any violations found there before continuing.

### Step 3B — Navigation Link Addition (Only When Adding a New Page)

**When to apply**: User is adding a new `.razor` page for a reporting component AND Phase 1 Step 1 item 6 discovered a navigation component.

**When to skip**: 
- Modifying an existing viewer/designer page (not adding a new one)
- User explicitly requested "don't add navigation" or "no nav link"
- Navigation could not be located in Phase 1 (alert user that they must add the link manually)

**Tasks**:
1. Locate the navigation component file from Phase 1 Step 1 item 6
2. Copy one existing `<NavLink>` element as a template
3. Create a new `<NavLink>` entry matching that pattern:
   - Use the `href` value matching the `@page` route from the new `.razor` file
   - Adapt the label text to match the component type (e.g., "Report Viewer", "Report Designer", "Document Viewer")
   - Keep the same CSS classes, icon pattern, and `Match` attribute as the existing links
4. Add this step to the plan **before** "Present and Execute"
5. During execution (Phase 3 Step 4), add the link to the navigation file after all other changes are complete

### Step 3C — Designer Data Source Trust Registration (Only When Designer Has Custom Data Sources)

**When to apply**: 
- A designer component (`DxReportDesigner` / `DxWasmReportDesigner`) is being added
- Phase 2 Decision Gate F found custom data source classes
- Data source classes are custom types (not built-in .NET classes)

**When to skip**: 
- Designer is not being added
- No custom data source classes were found
- Reports only use built-in data sources (ObjectDataSource with built-in types, JSON, SQL)

**Task**: If Decision Gate F identified custom data source classes, add trust registration code to `Program.cs` **before** `WebApplication.CreateBuilder()`. This applies when:
- Designer components save/load/preview reports with custom data sources
- Viewer components open reports from storage containing custom data sources

```csharp
DevExpress.Utils.DeserializationSettings.RegisterTrustedClass(typeof(YourDataSourceClass));
DevExpress.Utils.DeserializationSettings.RegisterTrustedClass(typeof(YourDataSourceClass[]));
```

For step-by-step guidance with examples and code generation, see 📄 [references/resolving-report-names.md — Data Source Trust Registration](resolving-report-names.md#security-trusted-types-for-custom-data-source-deserialization).

### Step 4 — Present and Execute

---

## Constraints & Rules

### Universal (apply to all interactions)

1. **Resolve component family before writing any code.** If the user names the component explicitly, branch immediately using Decision Gates A–C. If the wording is ambiguous, apply the Q2 script.
2. **Existing viewer family is immutable** unless migration is explicitly requested. Do not replace `DxReportViewer` with `DxDocumentViewer` or vice versa without explicit user consent.
3. **Interactive render mode required.** Add `@rendermode InteractiveServer` or `@rendermode InteractiveWebAssembly` to every reporting page. Exception: Standalone WASM apps are fully interactive by default — no directive needed.
4. **RegisterScripts in App.razor head.** `DxResourceManager.RegisterScripts()` must be in the `<head>` element. Without it, no client-side scripts load.
5. **Service registration is family and hosting-mode-specific.** Native viewer + Interactive Server: `AddDevExpressServerSideBlazorReportViewer()`. Native viewer + WASM Standalone: `AddDevExpressWebAssemblyBlazorReportViewer()`. JS-based: `AddDevExpressBlazorReporting()`. Do not mix registrations.
6. **`CreateDocumentAsync` in web.** Never call `report.CreateDocument()` synchronously. Always `await report.CreateDocumentAsync()`.
7. **Skia for non-Windows.** Add `DevExpress.Drawing.Skia` for any Linux/macOS deployment and for WASM viewer or standalone WASM designer.
8. **Version consistency.** All DevExpress NuGet packages must use the same version.
9. **Build verification.** Run `dotnet build --project <path>` after changes. Check for errors before reporting success.
10. **Integration is not done until the viewer renders content.** `new XtraReport()` with no bands makes the viewer look broken. Always wire in a real report class before declaring the task done.
11. **`IReportProvider` registration order.** Register **after** any `AddDevExpress*()` call — registering before lets the DevExpress proxy override it at runtime.
12. **Multiple designer controllers required.** `DxReportDesigner`/`DxWasmReportDesigner` need all three: `WebDocumentViewerController`, `ReportDesignerController`, `QueryBuilderController`. Build succeeds if any are missing; runtime fails with 404s. See **C21**/**C22**.

13. **`IReportProvider` and `ReportStorageWebExtension` are mutually exclusive.** Never register both. Designer requires storage; if storage is registered, remove any existing `IReportProvider` and use `XtraReport.FromXmlStream()` in the viewer.

## Troubleshooting

See 📄 [references/troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md) for the full symptom→fix table and diagnostic checklist.

**Quick diagnostics — most common causes:**
- Blank viewer → `@rendermode InteractiveServer` missing, or `DxResourceManager.RegisterScripts()` not in `App.razor <head>`
- "Service not registered" → wrong `AddDevExpress...()` call for the component family
- 404 on API calls (JS-based) → `UseDevExpressBlazorReporting()` or `MapControllers()` missing
- "Unable to resolve IUrlHelperFactory" → `AddControllers()` missing before `AddDevExpressBlazorReporting()`
- Designer Save/Load does nothing → `ReportStorageWebExtension` not registered **after** `AddDevExpressBlazorReporting()`
- Reports saved via designer not visible in native viewer → both `IReportProvider` and `ReportStorageWebExtension` registered; remove `IReportProvider` (see **Constraint 16**)
- Component blank or errors immediately in WASM mode → component placed in the wrong project (e.g., `DxDocumentViewer` in the server project instead of `.Client`); see Decision Gate D
- "Service not registered" in Auto or Interactive WebAssembly (Client + Server) → services registered in `.Client` `Program.cs` instead of server `Program.cs`, or vice versa; see Decision Gate D
